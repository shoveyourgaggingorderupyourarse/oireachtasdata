We all agree we need to regulate and have strong regulation of the approved housing body, AHB, sector.  It is important that regulation is effective without it being unduly onerous on the AHBs and that in no way does the regulator seek to control them.  It is also important the regulator is independent in its functions.  I believe we all share those principles and we all recognise the importance of the AHB sector in delivery much-need social housing homes.  The move to statutory regulation from voluntary regulation is important.  I have approached the amendments that have been tabled in the spirit in which they have been tabled.  We will try to agree amendments where we can, or see if we can find other workarounds to get the purpose of the amendment either into the legislation or into policy when it comes to the delivery of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019111900002#B00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574121600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1574121600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019111900002#B00700","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, to delete line 18 and substitute the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;charitable trust&rdquo; means-<blockquote>(a) a charitable trust within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009, or<br \/><br \/>(b) the Iveagh Trustees (also referred to as the Iveagh Trust) within the meaning of the Iveagh Trust Acts 1899 to 1961;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p>These amendments are straightforward.

I understood from the officials that even though they wanted this to remain in the Bill, it was not their intention to apply fees for registration.  My view is to just take it out.  I remind the Minister that it was the support of myself and others that ensured the fees that currently apply to AHBs for RTB registration and access to other mediation and adjudication services got through.

I want to be clear that we do not intend for the regulator to be self-financing.<\/p><p>We are not trying to use the section as some sort of back door for the regulator to start imposing fees on housing bodies to try to cover all of their costs.  There are things that the regulator might want to charge fees for, even in interim.  They may not necessarily apply to AHBs but perhaps to members of the public if they want a copy of the register.  Perhaps someone wants to make an appeal and there may be a need to charge a fee for that reason.<\/p><p> The section 11 permits the regulator, when established, to charge fees under a number of other sections.  I do not want to take away the power of the regulator to charge a fee to an individual in a case where he or she might be looking for a copy of the register but, to alleviate the concerns of Deputies, I could propose the deletion of two of the sections that would give the regulator the powers to charge fees to AHBs.  For example, I could delete section 35(5).  Section 35 deals with the transfer period between when the regulator is established and AHBs are deemed to be registered, but they will register over a period.  Section 35 is only relevant for those first three years and within it subsection (5) provides for an AHB to be charged a fee by the regulator.  The Deputies are saying that we should just take that out because it will not be needed or used and it does not need to be there.  Section 28(2)(e) relates to applications to the register being accompanied by an appropriate fee.  Given that we have said that the AHB sector will pay fees for registration with the RTB, in the initial stages we do not want to charge any fees in this regard.  I think that, again to alleviate concerns, if we remove that section then it will not be possible.<\/p><p> Section 11 is about warehousing, but I do not know if that is the best way to put it.  It is a framework by which the other sections will be implemented, but if we take out those two sections, the Deputies' fears will be alleviated.

The regulator and RTB will come to a memorandum of understanding on all of these issues, as the regulator will with other regulators in this sector, such as the Charities Regulator.  That is common practice.  It will not be about setting a new policy when it comes to matters such as standards.  This is about financial standards, governance standards and performance standards.  They should be reported on in such a way that people are clear that they were in line with policy or what is in the law.  It will still be the role of the RTB to have that involvement and that place for the tenant and the landlord.  We are not trying to step into the role of the RTB.  A letter to this effect was sent to members of the committee by the Housing Agency.  I do not know if everyone saw it.  It was a three or four page letter, making the point that it was not seeking to move into someone else's space, to move outside policy or to change policy.  This was about financial performance, governance performance and standards performance, so that people can see that things are being done with regard to response time for repairs or bringing voids back into use.

In fact, I want standards to be set down.  This is apropos of the general subject area of the amendment rather than the specific purpose of the amendment.  Could the Minister explain to me how somebody who has a difficulty with the standards, maintenance or such of an approved housing body unit is not at a disadvantage to a council tenant who would have the same problems?<\/p><p>One of the forms of recourse that the council tenant has which the AHB tenant does not have is that he or she can go to the local elected representative and have the issue brought up at the council.<\/p><p> To give an example of what I mean, there are minimum standards and there are best standards.  I have a group of AHB tenants who have complained about the lack of good sound insulation between units.  They have looked for an independent audit of the properties, which are in an estate called Cualanor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is quite a big estate.  That has not been provided.  They have done their own audit which basically states that the developer says the standards are fine, having taken a decibel-measuring machine around, but the residents are adamant that there is a major problem with sound between the units.  If those were council tenants, a local councillor could go to the council chamber on their behalf and say they are moving a motion to say there should be an independent audit.  If that motion was passed, there would be an independent audit to see whether there was a sound problem.<\/p><p> AHB tenants do not have that same recourse.  They can go to the RTB but it will only enforce minimal legal standards.  It cannot take the next step of saying it is just not happy with this and it is not good enough, even if it just about meets minimum standards.  I would be interested to hear the Minister address that.  To add to the complexity of it, if one takes this particular instance, these people were allocated places from the council housing list by the council.  They go into these AHBs but there is also a property management company and a private developer involved.  They have to deal with all these different layers, whereas if they were council tenants, there would be another form of recourse, which I have described.  One-stop shop would not be quite the right word but a tenant would know that he or she could go to a person and actually get something done.  I ask the Minister to comment on that because it is a problem which will become bigger.  The Minister will probably not agree with me but I think the Government is overly reliant on AHBs to deliver social housing and this will become a bigger issue.  We need to ensure that all social housing tenants, whatever type of social housing they are in, have the same rights and avenues for addressing problems as each other and that there is not a downgrading or dilution of the forms of recourse that they have because they happen to be in a particular AHB.

A further disadvantage is that as one's life changes, one may wish to move to a local authority housing estate, perhaps for family reasons or because it is nearer the school one's child attends.  There are certainly issues in that regard.  To date in any event, I have never found an AHB that does not want to meet the requirements of the tenant, although the cases the Deputy outlined are more complex because they are part of other, privately-developed housing.  I would not disagree with ensuring a right to an audience with an elected representative but the matter cannot be brought to a council because it will not be responsible, which is the difficulty.

I am not satisfied that the wording &quot;where the Regulator considers it is necessary&quot; sets that bar at an appropriate level.  My amendment, which is pretty self-explanatory, proposes the wording &quot;has reasonable suspicion that an AHB may not be fulfilling its responsibilities as set out in this Act and in particular the standards set out in <i>section 38<\/i>&quot;.  This means that the regulator cannot just get up one day and decide that he or she thinks this is necessary.  He or she must have some basis on which to act or some suspicion from either his or her own information or information presented to the regulator by a third party.

We believe, therefore, that \"considering it necessary\" is a higher threshold because that is a more serious position, that for it to be necessary for the regulator to be able to continue as a regulator, he or she must take this course of action.  I believe that is stronger than just a suspicion because it means the regulator has come to the conclusion that he or she can no longer regulate this entity effectively without putting in place an investigator and an investigation.  It is a higher bar to have to jump.  I think our wording meets the concerns of some who felt that the threshold might be too low, a concern Deputy &Oacute; Broin has also expressed.

I understand that the legislation is framed to move the regulatory framework to the next step, the statutory footing, and that, at a later stage, other issues, such as a resolution process and fund, may be addressed.  Over the next decade, small voluntary-sector and in many cases rural approved housing bodies with very small numbers of units, set up by voluntary boards, will have board members retiring, passing away or moving on.  We could end up with stock that starts to become the subject of resolution and transfer to larger bodies or bodies that are more competent.  There are major issues involved in this and I am not saying it is in any way easy.  Considerable issues arise over the condition of the stock, the mechanism by which stock is transferred, who makes the decision and with whose consent, the source of the funding, and whether there are sinking funds or structural issues.  I accept this is not the Bill in which to deal with all these matters.  That case has been made convincingly, and I have been convinced.  I have moved the amendment, however, because I still believe it deals with work that needs to be examined over the coming years by the Department.  This is the only mechanism I can put on the table to allow me to make this important point.<\/p><p>The Minister was not here when I last raised the issue of a very considerable stock transfer of very newly built units in my constituency.  It is a matter of public record.  Cara Housing Association had to transfer some of the units from M&eacute;ile an R&iacute; drive back to the local authority.  They were the subject of a very significant controversy over a company called Gama.  It was widely documented in the press at the time.  The building quality was of such a poor standard that the approved housing body could no longer finance the maintenance of the stock.  There was a very public transfer.  That was not necessarily the happiest of transfers.  I am not saying the local authority commented on it publicly but it had to take on significant additional liability.<\/p><p>Resolution will become an issue whether we like it or not.  The decision-making process and financing will become issues.<\/p><p>The Minister is going to explain why he cannot accept the amendment but I would like him to at least accept the spirit in which I am raising this issue.  We will all have to return to it in the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019111900002#U01000","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I like this amendment.

I wanted to ensure a recommendation for the purposes of the section would be made by the Public Appointments Service in order that it would not just be the Minister who would choose the ten people he or she wanted.  As part of this discussion, we talked about advocates in the disability sector and particularly used as an example ensuring there would be housing stock available for people with disabilities and that they would be represented in that regard.

The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel states the amendment is not necessary in primary legislation because I am bound by certain duties in the Government code of practice.  I know that there is a fear that the Minister might just go and appoint ten people whom he or she had hand-picked.  I have never done that and it is actually very rare for someone to go outside the PAS in making appointments.  When they are brought to the Cabinet, a Minister has to state if a person has not been appointed through the PAS and explain why.  It is quite rare to go outside the PAS.  I can think of an example in which I would potentially need to go outside the PAS in this instance.  In the case of the voluntary regulator, we had a tenant representative as a member, a tenancy advocate and it was difficult to find a replacement for that person.  The public appointments system is great and only from time to time is there a need to step outside it.  I am trying to think of a time when I might have stepped outside it.  I have probably done so once, but it is rare.  I would not want to have something in legislation that was not deemed to be required to get in my way in needing to appoint a disability advocate, or a tenant advocate, or another type of advocate we cannot think of today because the issue has not yet presented, or because of the way that things and culture change.

The purpose of the meeting is to continue our deliberations on the topic of the impact of education on the Traveller community.  We have had one meeting on this topic and two more are scheduled after today.  It may be worth making some observations and mentioning some facts as a way of framing our conversation.  As an opening reflection, I emphasise that education is a key issue for Travellers and that Travellers value education greatly.  As the delegates point out in their submission - I apologise for stealing their words - it is a &quot;real misconception&quot; to think otherwise.  Travellers experience significant barriers at all levels as they seek to access education.  Schools can be a very cold place for them.  Even though people can start out with great enthusiasm, it is often the case that their experience when they land in school is not conducive to flourishing in that space.<\/p><p>Traveller history and culture are still not reflected in the school curriculum.  The massive cuts to Traveller education services made in the 2000s have not yet been restored or reversed.  Traveller children are more likely to have timetables with reduced hours.  This issue has been examined in great detail by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  It is sobering and arresting for this committee to think about the fact that just 80% of Travellers transfer from primary to secondary school.  Traveller children are 50 times more likely than children from the general population to leave school without completing the leaving certificate examinations.  Just 13% of female Travellers are educated to upper secondary level, as opposed to 69% of the general population.  According to the last census, just 167 Travellers have a third level qualification.  As a consequence, the unemployment rate among Travellers is 80%.  I am sure all of the statistics I have mentioned will be discussed again.<\/p><p>I welcome Ms Shreya Chaturvedi, a development worker with the Yellow Flag programme.  She is accompanied by Mr. Bernard Joyce, the director of the Irish Traveller Movement; Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in, with whom I had the pleasure of working closely for a full year and who is incredibly helpful in the proceedings and the work that is ongoing in the Oireachtas on Travellers' rights and issues; and Mr. Martin Collins from Pavee Point.

My input is as a development worker of the Yellow Flag programme.  I am joined by Mr. Bernard Joyce, director of the Irish Traveller Movement.  The Yellow Flag programme is an innovative whole-school initiative which supports schools to celebrate diversity, promote inclusion and challenge racism.<\/p> <p>  Pioneered initially by the Irish Traveller Movement as an intercultural innovative solution to address poor educational experiences and outcomes for Travellers, it took account of similar exclusion and marginalisation faced by other ethnic minorities and created a programme to encompass children from both majority and minority backgrounds, including Travellers.  The programme is goal-centred and accreditation focused under which schools are obliged to meet targets over a comprehensive eight-step strategy.  It is not an optional soft-choice programme but one that requires change to be monitored and visible both in the student population and among the staff and the community.<\/p> <p>  The Yellow Flag programme recognises the risk factors and the potential for Travellers and other ethnic minority children to experience disconnection and insecurity within schools and so the whole-school approach is vital to fostering positive identity among all pupils.  However, even with efforts towards Yellow Flag accreditation, school bias and discrimination towards Travellers is so ingrained that in addressing racism among diverse groups, often teachers and school management are blind to the experience of Travellers and their and the school's unconscious bias.  Factors such as identity-based exclusion, historical prejudice, conscious and unconscious bias, absence of Travellers in teaching and school management, institutional racism and poor awareness and knowledge of Traveller culture within teaching practice all have a detrimental effect on the educational progression and learning of young Travellers, and on their sense of identity and self-belief.<\/p> <p>  The National Traveller Survey 2017 revealed that four out of ten Travellers said they or their children were bullied in school.  In 2017 the Department of Justice and Equality commissioned an ESRI report, A Social Portrait of Travellers, which found Travellers are more than 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate in comparison to the non-Traveller population.  Even within Yellow Flag schools, racism towards Travellers dramatically increases in post-primary settings and it is not uncommon to find examples of Traveller students who are actively involved in the Yellow Flag primary schools who dropped out after their transition to a secondary school that was not involved in the programme.<\/p> <p>  Since 2009 the Yellow Flag programme has worked with 87 schools, 61 families and 26 post-primary schools.  That is a significant number given the limited resources available to the programme.  The programme has reached 33,535 students and more than 2,600 teachers, yet 53% of the pupils who took part in the intercultural surveys in 2009 as part of the programme recorded that they had witnessed racist comments or behaviours towards others in their school.  That is the reason the following recommendations are very important.  In order to be able to strengthen and secure the long-term impact it can have on the Irish education system, the Yellow Flag programme needs to be mainstreamed across all primary and secondary schools.  In addition to addressing the demand that already exists, it is imperative to reach out to schools with very few or no Traveller students as well.  To really impact Traveller participation, retention and progression in the education system it would be valuable to introduce a Yellow Flag model for preschool and third level settings as well.  As part of the continuing professional development, CPD, for teaching staff, anti-racist and intercultural training should be mandatory to actively inform the school staff to be mindful of their behaviour towards students from minority ethnic groups, especially Travellers.  Strong legislation towards a national anti-racism policy for schools is essential to encourage the Traveller community to remain in school and, therefore, reduce barriers to accessing second and third level education.  Clear links with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would be critical in achieving a long-term impact.  However, to date, no concrete connection has been established despite their efforts.<\/p><p>I am happy to answer any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Shreya Chaturvedi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Chaturvedi.

When people speak of Travellers, it is my experience that we as Travellers are rarely the ones who are speaking and, ever rarer, the ones who are heard.<\/p> <p>  I am currently manage St. Oliver&rsquo;s education centre, Cloverhill.  We mainly engage with adults over the age of 18.  Those who engage with the centre are predominantly from the Traveller community.  Many of the newer students were young when draconian cuts were made to Traveller-specific resources in 2011 and 2012.  That was when the visiting teachers service for Travellers was disbanded, resource teachers for Travellers were no longer deployed, cuts to the 1.5 additional teacher hours were made, and all senior Traveller training centres were closed, without a suitable alternative.  The continued effects of the cuts, compounded by low expectations and the system being either disinterested in or having difficulty in engaging with Travellers, owing to a very settled narrative, continue to be reflected daily in the lives of young people.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, the committee will be very well aware of the statistics surrounding Travellers in general as well as those on education, but I will repeat them because, while they are numbers, they are also reflective of people's lives.  According to the CSO 2016 census, just 13.3% of Traveller females have an upper second level education.  Nearly six in every ten Traveller males were educated to primary level at the very most, and only 167 Travellers have a third level qualification.  According to the ERSI's report, A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, dated 2017, Travellers are 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate and only 9% of those aged between 25 and 34 have completed second level education.<\/p> <p>  There exists a very real misconception within the wider community that Travellers do not value education.  This is not true.  There exists among all people a desire to prosper, grow and learn, and the doorways created by education are greatly valued and desired by Travellers.  However, many of these doorways are locked to us.  They can be locked by the under-provision of accommodation, the consequences of poverty, when education strategies just remain strategies, and when they, the doorways, are not even considered to be for us.  Sometimes when they are open, they have been opened by those who may know very little about us, or a lot about us that is erroneous.<\/p> <p>  Currently, there are programmes in place in regard to third level education for Travellers.  These are much needed and very warmly welcomed but they will be little more than bandages on deep wounds when the vast majority of Travellers do not finish second level.  The majority of Travellers who leave the education system early leave at second level.  Additional strategies and programmes are needed at this level to support retention and completion.  We also need to be more aware of intersectionality within the community and create robust programmes that include and support it.  Currently, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy has only one action in regard to disabilities, action 12, which seeks to facilitate children at preschool level.  The ESRI report states, by way of age comparison, that 10% of Travellers have a learning disability, 13% experience mobility limitations and 11% have difficulty in getting to school or work due to a long-term condition or disability.  Consideration of this intersectionality is essential if we are to make progress.<\/p> <p>  A very real and bright blessing in my life has been my involvement in regard to the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, a Bill that seeks to be part of a process of ensuring schools are safer places for Traveller children, a process in which our identities will not be denied, reduced or removed, and a process in which all children and young people learn about who we really are, not only as an attempt to remove the biases and suspicions we live with but also to reflect a very real, truer Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Since 2001, the NCCA has made recommendations to include Traveller culture and history in the curriculum but, in conjunction with a recent NCCA audit, it was proven that these recommendations have largely failed, with only two optional modules in the senior cycle being directly inclusive of Travellers.  I understand that the Minster of Education and Skills remains very open to the process and I feel we must step away from the charity of potentially being included to an assurance that we will be.  Sadly, time has shown that when Travellers are a choice, they are just not chosen.  To do other than what I propose places a great weight of responsibility for the education of students, teachers and the institutions on the shoulders of children.  <\/p> <p>  We need to ensure that intercultural awareness training is mandatory for teachers, regardless of who they are teaching, as there is a wide array of opinions and practices, deliberate or unconscious, that can be devastating to the young.  Education should be in a place of safety, it should be aware, and it should be accessible and for all.  Programmes help and projects can bring some opportunities for progression but without an authentic structural change, we will be forever an add-on.  Our children and yours deserve much better than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Martin Collins from Pavee Point to make the opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#J00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I will be extremely brief.  We have provided our submission and as the Chairman said, the committee has already had one hearing on the issue of Travellers and education.  Also, I am reminded that I and many others were in this building twice this year already speaking about Travellers and the challenges in respect of education.  Some reports have come from that, one on progression from primary to second level.  I believe there is a second report on the issue of reduced timetables, but I am open to correction on that, so people are well versed on the issues and the challenges facing Travellers in the education system.  Nonetheless, we welcome once again this opportunity to address the joint committee on some of the challenges and, potentially, some of the solutions.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman made an opening comment about misconceptions.  It is also a misconception to say that Travellers drop out of education.  It is more a question of being pushed out of education when we have a system that is monocultural, that only reflects a majority perspective and culture, where there is no positive reinforcement or visibility of Traveller culture and Traveller identity, and where we have racism and discrimination.  As we all know, the school yard and the classroom can be a microcosm of the wider society.  All those issues are major factors in terms of Travellers not being able to access, participate in and get decent outcomes in terms of educational attainment.  I prefer to use the term \"pushed out\" rather than \"dropped out\".  That was certainly my experience having attended primary school many years ago.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on some of the recommendations we see as being key but before doing that I will make a more general point.  We are living in very difficult and challenging times in Ireland in terms of human rights and equality across the board, not just for Travellers.  There is no doubt that we have seen an increase in right-wing rhetoric and populism.  I remind the members that we cannot be complacent about that.  We need to be vigilant and we need strong political leadership in addressing racism and the rise of the right in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In light of that, we welcome the recent consultative process in respect of hate speech and hate crime that the Department of Justice and Equality is carrying out.  We all know that racism and discrimination can happen at many levels.  It can happen at the individual level and also at the institutional level.  We see the negative impacts of that in every aspect of Travellers' lives.  This is clearly evident in the area of education, from what Mr. De Bhaird&uacute;in and the Chairman said in terms of the statistics, which I will not repeat.<\/p> <p>  I am also reminded of the first Hispanic judge in the United States Supreme Court.  Her name is Sonia Sotomayor.  She once said that unless we get equality in education, we will not have an equal society.  The educational system, in my opinion, perpetuates that inequality.<\/p> <p>  A recent UNICEF report stated that Traveller children are still falling between the cracks, with the vast majority of Traveller children ceasing education before their junior certificate examination.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the recommendations, we are all well versed on the statistics.  The challenge is to create a more inclusive learning context that promotes respect for diversity and interculturalism and that addresses racism at all its levels and in all its guises.  One way of achieving that is through the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, which we welcome.  We hope that Bill will be adopted and fully implemented, thereby ensuring Travellers will have positive reinforcement of their identity within the school curriculum.<\/p> <p>  We also need to deal with the culture of low expectations that many teachers and principals have in respect of Travellers.  When that continues, it limits Travellers achieving their full potential and goals in life.<\/p> <p>  We want to see the re-establishment of the Traveller education advisory forum.  Traveller organisations have no real way of feeding into the development and implementation of education policy.  We want to see the re-establishment of that consultative forum, which was disbanded in 2016.<\/p><p>We want to see the development of a new Traveller education strategy.  What we have is piecemeal.  There is a sub-committee of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion steering group, NTRIS, but we do not have a clear strategy or policy for or on Traveller education.  We want to see the restoration of the savage cuts made to the Traveller education budget, to the tune of 85%, imposed during the austerity period.<\/p><p> As I said in this room previously, we cannot deal with Traveller education in isolation from other issues.  There is an interdependence in terms of access to secure, adequate and high quality accommodation, employment and healthcare and in addressing entrenched and institutionalised racism.  We need a multifaceted, multi-agency, co-ordinated and structured approach to address these issues.  Addressing one in isolation from the others is doomed to failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I will ask some general questions and whoever wishes to respond can do so.  The questions do not target a particular contribution.<\/p> <p>  The education system has not owned up to the way it treats Travellers.  I have far too many heated debates with teachers about the culture of low expectations.  It is very much a case of \"but...\"  It is believed teachers are well meaning, but somehow the fact is ignored that they do not spend time in empowering a young Traveller child and going on a journey with them or his or her family.  I would welcome comments on the low expectations for Traveller children, something I have experienced. Travellers are ostracised, even within my community.  They feel the low level of expectations even more than I do.  What impact does this have on the Traveller community?  How do we address the issue?  The Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill is one measure, but the psyche of teachers and school principals has not allowed them to acknowledge that that is the way they treat Traveller children.  How can we even begin to make sure we change that culture if they are not even willing to stand up and accept that this is what they create in the classroom?  At second level, in particular, there is a culture of ignoring Traveller children to the point where they just move away.  It almost seems to be the approach taken by teachers to push children out of the system, as Mr. Collins said, and make life a little easier for them in the classroom in not having to acknowledge their own bias.  What can we do to get people to take ownership of the issue of their low expectations for the Traveller community?  Are there positive examples to which to point in Ireland where schools are getting it right?  Is there any school that comes to mind where what it is doing is good?  Is there even one positive example that we could look to expand?  The Yellow Flag programme will be launched in schools.  Have the delegates come across a school that they can say has created the right environment for Traveller children?<\/p> <p>  How do we begin to support families to advocate for their children in the education system?  I refer to a child who had a negative experience of the school system as a Traveller and is going back as a parent.  As he or she never felt he or she had been heard as a student, why would he or she be heard as a parent?  How can we support parents to advocate for their children in a system that can be cruel and cold?<\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills asked Mr. Collins to come before it.  It was done at the very last minute, but the committee was looking at the question of digital competency.  If Traveller children are already falling way behind and being pushed out of the education system, what will it mean in the context of how quickly we are moving in acquiring digital competencies and skills - digital literacy - within the workforce?  Are there programmes within the education system aimed at young Traveller children to enable them to acquire digital literacy skills?<\/p><p>I am particularly concerned about class bias in algorithms and how people are being kept out of employment or the education system just because of their surname or address.  This will have a considerable impact on the Traveller community.  I am just wondering whether anything is being done regarding digital literacy among Traveller students?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#K00200","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane.

There is a multidisciplinary team involved consisting of Travellers, an education welfare officer and a home&ndash;school liaison official.  The pilots are for two years and are funded by the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.  That must be acknowledged.  The aim of the pilots is to support Traveller access, participation and progression throughout the education system.  Part of the team's remit will be to work with Traveller parents and to advocate for and empower them to develop the confidence and skill set to engage with school staff, including the principal, to ensure the best interest of their children is being met.  There is a national oversight committee for that.  It includes Traveller organisations.  The programme will be reviewed and documented.  If it proves to be effective, it should be expanded to other parts of the country.  That is a positive development that I wish to acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy to develop an affirmative action programme that would give Travellers the opportunity to gain access to teacher training colleges to become teachers.  That is really important because the only way one can develop trust and confidence in any institution is when one sees one's own face reflected back when one looks at it.  The same principle applies to the Garda and other institutions.  That is probably the most effective way, albeit not the only way, of developing trust and confidence among Travellers in the education system.  It is when they see their own faces in the system as teachers and principals.  That is where we really need to be heading.  We need to be very ambitious, not timid.  We need to make it happen.  All of us, through the strategy, are advocating strongly in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Would anybody else like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#L00400","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I would.

We are putting much-needed resources into them and I hope they will be successful.<\/p> <p>  We must ask about how we are challenging existing structures.  Are we creating another avenue for people to prosper without actually challenging the core?  We must educate teachers who are already in our institutions; otherwise we are creating something that does not need to be there.<\/p> <p>  I was part of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's audit of best practice in schools across the country.  We genuinely struggled.  We came across cases where schools were doing quite well because of teachers or principals who were doing their best, but the work was based on the personality and individual interventions of the teachers and principals rather than on a structure based on the Traveller children engaging daily.  In itself, this resulted in hesitation.  A model based on a very limited number of people, who could potentially move on, could be pushed as best practice rather than ensuring support structures are maintained.<\/p><p>On the need for ongoing audits, I am aware that when schools undergo their own audits, they will look to ensure the inclusion of Travellers within the curriculum.  This also needs to be done in a way that audits and reviews of schools look at how they present the language and tuition on Travellers in a normative way, and that the Traveller community itself can be part of that process.  If one asks schools if they are doing well in that regard, the chances are that they will respond that they are.  We need to have our voices at that table as a counter narrative to show if there are gaps developing, perhaps in a very authentic way, and then we can highlight them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>As part of the Yellow Flag programme, all schools in the programme are required to go through diversity and equality training.

This gives them the opportunity to discuss relevant and sometimes controversial issues they are not able to talk about within the daily routine of the school.<\/p> <p>  Up to now we have reached approximately 2,563 school staff through this training.  In October 2018, we conducted an independent evaluation, results of which show that 70% of the schools said their staff had a better understanding of racism, 72% said their staff had a better understanding of cultural diversity and 63% said their staff had the opportunity to discuss and raise relevant issues.  These are positive findings considering the limited scale as we are only able to provide two hours of training to every school that we go to.  This is not even enough time to go deep into the relevant issues.  Given this limitation, these are positive findings.<\/p> <p>  We have also developed an additional digital training course, which is the Yellow Flag self-awareness training, through which we encourage teachers, other school staff and parents to do in groups.  This helps to explore hidden biases and how people can make sure it does not affect their delivery in the classroom.  The fourth step of the programme requires an intercultural survey to be done by all students and parents of the school.  In a lot of those surveys, many statistics and open-ended answers come out, which make the teachers realise they are probably not thinking about the issue enough.  They are supposed to develop an action plan based on that, which makes sure they are addressing each and everything that comes up in the intercultural survey.  Even then, as I said earlier, the bias is so ingrained that as a development worker - and many more people before me - I have had to point out certain issues that are particular to the treatment of Travellers.  We have to make sure the issues are pointed out and that they do something about it.  We are happy to provide the committee with many good examples in schools, especially primary schools, that have included Travellers extremely well.

Young Travellers raised the issue of teachers not valuing them as much as their settled peers and using them for sports instead of academia.  They need more support and information in school, for example, assistance with grant applications and the cost of same.  Despite the talk about supporting people in education, we are not giving young people that support.<\/p> <p>  On incomes, Mr. Collins alluded to how the Traveller economy was in decline.  As such, there is a need to increase the value of education within the community.  Although young people are being pushed out of school, there are a number of other factors involved in early school leaving.  For example, young people might not like school, they are being bullied, they feel silly about not having literacy skills or they are not in a comfortable space, in the sense that other young people are leaving them out.  Another factor is their culture is not seen in the classroom or school.  These factors were even evident when I was going to school in the 1980s.  They are intergenerational issues which continue the cycle.<\/p> <p>  If people want to see something being done, the Yellow Flag programme is an example of an initiative, but we need to see a strong policy approach being taken to address the underlying issues.

One of the challenges we face as we seek to get people to engage with education generally is that some people do not see education as having any benefit for themselves.  We all know people who ask what the point of learning Irish or Latin is, because nobody speaks those languages.  They do not see the point of learning all sorts of things.  Other people believe that all education is good because they see results around them in their own communities.  It seems to me that we keep coming around with this circular challenge.  Our failure to get people from the Traveller community into professions, because of all the barriers we have placed in their way, is creating a challenge for the next generation.  If people are able to look up to a level of previous success when they see members of their own families who managed to get through the education system and do well out of it, they will see that they can get the advantages from education that the rest of society can get from it.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention a classic example that really brought this home to me.  Some of those present will know Dr. Miche&aacute;l MacGr&eacute;il, who did a huge sociological study that included a chapter on the status of Irish-language speakers in society, as opposed to the status of the Irish language.  It also included a chapter on the status of Travellers in society.  Unfortunately, Travellers were at the very lowest level in terms of the way the rest of society perceived them and Irish speakers were right up at the top.  I remind those who might respond to this finding by saying \"that is the way it is\" that 100 or 150 years ago, Irish speakers were out on the margins - where the language survived - as poor fishermen and farmers with the poorest land.  When I started to think about this matter, it struck me that this change was brought about by various forms of State support.  It is interesting to recall that because the new State wanted Irish-language teachers, it put many people from very disadvantaged backgrounds through the training colleges because they had the one thing the State was looking for - the Irish language.  As a result, everyone in these communities had a relative who became a teacher.  Many of them moved into other things.  I started to think about social engineering as I looked at Dr. MacGr&eacute;il's sociological study and reflected on how these groups have diverged over 120 years.  I remind the committee that his study is dedicated to the Traveller community and refers to apartheid in Ireland.  When he talks about apartheid, he is not talking about Travellers - he is talking about the settled community's attitude to Travellers.  We will have a huge challenge when we reach the next module, which relates to employment.  None of us wants to do things from which there are no results.  When people train for football teams, they want to win matches.  When people do things, they want to see results.  One of the challenges we face is that when Travellers get education, they find it more difficult than settled people to get employment.  This means the results of education are not as immediately obvious.<\/p><p>Leaving the Traveller Community aside, I look across at communities that may have 70% going to third level education and other communities that have 20% going to third level education.  One asks why that is so given that they have teachers with the same qualifications and so on.  It seems to come back to the expectation issue.  For example, in some rural communities very few of the parents went to third level education even though some other relatives may have.  They still seem to get an extraordinarily high level of participation.  Many people living very far away from the third level institutions go to third level education while some people in areas close to the M50 get low levels of participation.  Here we get into issues of expectation and peer pressure from other students.  In one the peer pressure seems to be to get on in school as that is the way forward.  We might not have given sufficient attention to addressing this major challenge.<\/p><p> How can we create the expectation within the education system that people can reach for the stars and get there?  In reality they can become doctors, teachers, top scientist or anything else they want to be.  There should be no psychological barrier to getting there, but it seems to be there if we look at this realistically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#P00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Perhaps the witnesses might respond to those questions about social engineering and expectations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#Q00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was speaking, I was reminded of how it becomes a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy.  This culture of low expectations has to a degree been internalised certainly by a significant number of Travellers who feel not good enough, that education is not for them, or that they cannot become a garda or a doctor.  That is gradually eroding thankfully.  Much of that low expectation of oneself has been internalised, which is not totally surprising after decades if not centuries of oppression and negative messaging, sometimes in very explicit ways and sometimes in very implicit ways that someone is not good enough.  When picking up that message from cradle to grave, some people internalise it.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy and it becomes intergenerational with people passing it on to their children leading to a vicious cycle.  The challenge is breaking that culture of low expectation within the system, in the institutions, in the schools and in the community.<\/p> <p>  The people best placed to break that internalised inferiority complex are Traveller organisations.  We do a lot of work on cultural identity, self-esteem and confidence.  However, we need the funding and resources to do that important work, to instil pride, confidence and a sense of belief that they can accomplish.  We have seen it with other ethnic groups in other parts of the globe.  I travel quite a bit in Europe.

I will quote from a16 year old in post primary school in 2009:<\/p><blockquote>I love music and art.  I want to be a musician and a model.  I'm really scared to tell my class that I'm a Traveller and have anxiety about this.  Most of my class have said that they are already racist and that their parents do not like us Travellers living in their area.

I am the only Traveller in the class, but I don't want to tell my teacher as it could make the situation worse.<\/blockquote><p>That is a case study and many Travellers do not feel that they can disclose their identity.  They do not feel confident because of the level of prejudice and discrimination they experience.

That is one in a third level institution.  There is another one probably from a primary school.  It is also important.  It is from a seven year old who says that she cannot be herself in school.  Our education system is not inclusive and is not welcoming.  Being a Traveller is nearly a resistance in itself.

We are in a more regressive position now than we were when the visiting teacher service was in place and when there were links with the schools and the parents.  There was an increase in children transferring over to post-primary education and it went up to 90% or 95%.  When the cuts came in they cut the specific educational supports directly to Travellers, which was criminal.  It was morally wrong to do that at a time Travellers were starting to catch up.  It shows that the most marginalised and most excluded groups were the most affected by the cuts.<\/p><p>Travellers were particularly impacted when the social inclusion budget was cut and we have not yet got back to where we were more than 15 years ago.  Going back further, 20 years ago and more, I can personally attest that there were many Travellers in segregated schools.  It is good that they are no longer <i>in situ<\/i>, because they reflected a dark past in terms of how society treated Travellers.  Those institutional schools did not offer the intermediate or leaving certificate and there was no expectation that Traveller children would go further and do better things.  That issue probably deserves a hearing in its own right in terms of how Travellers were treated by the State.<br\/><br\/>The pilot programmes are a welcome new initiative.  The idea is that they will be very much based within the community, as part of which a number of Travellers will be employed and will link in with some of the education bodies.  They will look at issues like skills attainment and some of the challenges Traveller children face in schools.  The proposal is for a well resourced model, with a team linking in with Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.

I was one of the children who was supported 15 years ago to progress to higher education.  Five years before that, there was more of a barrier in place.  When I was going through the system, there were structures in place which, although not perfect, were well funded.  We had centres, teachers and teaching hours set aside for this purpose.  The resources could have been better deployed but at least they were in place.  Since the cuts were imposed, there has been no sustainable engagement with our community.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about what it is possible to achieve.  We have seen a shift in a generation from a situation where Irish speakers were isolated and segregated to a position where sustained structural and societal support from the State has seen that situation flipped.  The same is possible for Travellers, but the will must be there and there must be a recognition of the value of our community and its contribution.  The new legislation could potentially be very powerful if it helps people to begin to understand what we have contributed to this society via music, crafts, language and our understanding of oral traditions.  If people understood that, they would have a better sense of where we are and why we are here.  However, that is only one step in the process.  There must be restoration to address the horrendous cuts that were made and more programmes must be put in place.  We need not only to devise an educational strategy but to ensure that it is implemented, audited and surveyed.  There must be accountability.  The only people experiencing the consequences of the lack of accountability and engagement are Travellers themselves.  We are talking about people who are very much isolated in society and at the heel of the foot of many people.  The State has a responsibility to intervene now.

There is no doubt in my mind that there are structures in place which are very hostile to Travellers for being Travellers.<\/p> <p>  Two things that were helpful in the past were the visiting teacher service and the provision of additional resources.  One of the changes that is required is that it should be teachers from our community doing the teaching.  The reduction in resources that we have described has caused significant damage because it removed linkages that were there with people who may not have been involved in the traditional structures and wanted to maintain some degree of nomadism while also valuing and wanting to pursue their educational progression.  We strongly recommend that the visiting teacher service be reinstated in a new form that facilitates nomadism.
