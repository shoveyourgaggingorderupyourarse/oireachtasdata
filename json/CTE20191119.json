The chairman, Mr. Nicky Hartery, I and Mr. Jonathan Mullin, our head of communications, are here.  Horse racing and breeding is a significant industry in the country, producing almost &euro;2 billion in total expenditure annually and supporting 29,000 direct and indirect jobs.  More than 1.3 million people attend race meetings every year across 26 racecourses throughout the country.  Using some key metrics for this year, the domestic racing industry is performing well.  Our published figures for the first half of 2019 showed attendances at Irish race meetings increased by 9%.  Betting with on-course bookmakers rose by 11.5% for the first half of the year.  Those numbers point to the popularity of racing in Ireland, which makes the business side of racing and breeding more viable for operators throughout the country.  In the first six months of 2019, the number of horses in training increased by 3.5%, the number of active owners increased by 8.5%, and new owners registered increased by 9.5%.  These numbers show increased participation in the industry, and that is good news for towns and villages throughout the country that benefit from local employment and spin-off secondary expenditure.<\/p> <p>  Last August, the committee received copies of Deloitte's regional economic impact reports, which detail the impact that horse racing and breeding have in rural Ireland.  These reports were a region-by-region analysis of a 2017 Deloitte report that showed the economic value of the thoroughbred racing and breeding industry to Ireland as being &euro;1.8 billion per annum, generating employment, both direct and indirect, of 29,000 people and annual sales of &euro;438 million.  These are significant figures and, when broken down by county, the economic figures for counties traditionally associated with horse breeding and racing are noteworthy.  For example, more than 2,500 jobs in County Tipperary are supported directly and indirectly by racing, and those jobs fuel almost &euro;400 million in annual expenditure in that county.  Each industry will have its own clusters and there are clearly centres of excellence for horses in places such as Tipperary, Cork, Meath, Kildare, Carlow and Kilkenny, where the scale of the impact is strong and cannot be replicated everywhere.<\/p> <p>  The Deloitte report makes clear that there is a strong regional spread of this rural industry throughout the country.  In the midlands, which we categorise as Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath, there are an estimated 1,200 direct and indirect jobs supported by racing and almost &euro;100 million in annual expenditure in those four counties.  These are significant numbers.  In the north west, in Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, which might be regarded as a quiet area for horse racing, there are 120 jobs and more than &euro;12 million in expenditure.  These are relatively significant figures and I am confident that they will grow.  Donegal has shown a great trend in recent years towards producing young jockeys of the highest calibre, which perhaps demonstrates a growing interest in the county in working with horses and participating in our industry.  In the west, in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon, racing and breeding support almost 1,000 jobs with more than &euro;100 million in expenditure.  By any measure in that region, 1,000 jobs are very significant.<\/p> <p>  This is an industry that delivers on Government investment and a sport that continues to be one of the most popular activities in the country.  However, those positive figures mask some serious concerns in areas that we know need care, attention and investment.  Ireland has many advantages when it comes to horse racing and breeding.  The most fundamental advantage of all is our land and our climate.  The country is suited to rearing horses.  Our limestone soil is good for bone structure development.  We have a tradition of horse care among our people that is the envy of the world over.  It is not a clich&eacute; to say that no matter where one is in the world, whether Australia, Japan or America, if one is at a racetrack or training yard, one will quickly see and hear Irish people.  Those talents are world renowned and the reason people come from around the world to Ireland to invest in the horse business.  Ireland has always had a close affinity and skill with the racehorse.  A recent report showed that there were 50 thoroughbred horses per 10,000 people in Ireland, a multiple of any other major racing nation.  The equivalent ratio in the UK is four horses per 10,000 people.  It shows the intensity of the industry in Ireland compared with other countries.<\/p> <p>  Most of the almost 7,000 registered horse breeders in Ireland are scattered around the country, and 92% own five brood mares or fewer.<\/p><p>Although horse racing sometimes has an image as the sport of kings or the domain of big battalions, I reiterate that 92% of breeders, who are the backbone of the industry, own five brood mares or fewer.<br\/><br\/>The headwinds we are facing will have an impact throughout the country.  Brexit is the biggest headwind of all.  Regardless of what happens in Britain in the next few months, there will be no soft Brexit for Irish horse racing and breeding.  After Brexit, Ireland will be isolated geographically from its key export market.  As a way of putting in context how important the thoroughbred export market is to rural Ireland, I would like to mention that Ireland produces more thoroughbreds each year than Great Britain and France combined.  Just over 9,000 foals are born in Ireland every year.  This is more than the UK and France combined.  Ireland is the third biggest producer of thoroughbred horses in the world.  Approximately 60% of the horses we produce every year are exported, and 80% of those exports go to the UK.  We cannot ignore the fact that Britain is an irreplaceable market for the Irish thoroughbred.  Our real fear, as reported in <i>The Irish Field<\/i>and other racing media last week, relates to the political desire in Westminster to put in place domestic policies and incentives after Brexit that would aggressively give an advantage to the British breeding industry.  There has been some talk about a supply imbalance and an excessive dependence on Ireland for the supply of horses.  If that happens, there is no doubt that Ireland will be the country that is most negatively affected.  We need to invest significantly in the horse racing industry to combat the impact of Brexit and any potential protectionism from our main markets.<br\/><br\/>Horse Racing Ireland has developed a strong strategic plan for the next five years.  The plan, which is before the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, needs Government support and funding.  We know that with the support of the Government, we can develop this industry further in a way that brings about growth in rural employment and increases economic output.  We are happy to discuss any aspects of our plan, which is necessarily ambitious, with the joint committee.  The plan sets targets for increased participation across all levels of the industry, including the flat, jumps and point-to-points.  It includes an ambition to develop a second all-weather track, which would be a key piece of infrastructure for the industry.  This development could include a training incubation hub based at the track, which would be used by young start-up trainers to help them to get a start in the industry and to provide the kind of assistance that will lead to growth in employment and economic activity in rural Ireland.<br\/><br\/>We need to invest in equine welfare and staff welfare programmes.  Our strategic plan provides for a total redevelopment of the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown, County Kildare.  As the chairman of Horse Racing Ireland, Mr. Nicky Hartery, told this committee last year, the industry is renowned for the care that racehorses get.  We have seen in other jurisdictions &ndash; primarily in America and most recently in Australia &ndash; that it is crucial for standards of care to be maintained at the highest possible levels.  The current facility that houses the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown is not fit for purpose.  Significant investment is needed to maintain what is, in effect, the industry's current insurance premium.  It goes without saying that a disease-free herd is essential to underpin the trade in bloodstock.  The role the Irish Equine Centre plays for the State in ensuring the health and welfare of racehorses and many other types of animals cannot be underestimated.<br\/><br\/>We recognise and understand that budget 2020 was a standstill budget that was written under the threat of a no-deal Brexit.  It left many things the way they were before the budget.  If the industry is to prosper and grow, increased funding is necessary to support the ambitions in the strategic plan.  The good news is that the means to do this is now in place.  In our view, it would be much better if horse racing in Ireland, rather than competing for funds with other causes from the general taxation pool, were to be funded as it is in many other major racing countries through taxes generated by those who choose to bet on the sport.  We are grateful for the encouragement we have received to this end from the Minister, Deputy Creed.  We look forward to future positive engagement with the Minister and his officials on making the strategic plan a reality when the uncertainty around Brexit has been removed.  Our plans for racing and breeding in Ireland will provide a dividend for Government support and an economic return for rural Ireland.  We believe this can be done at a reduced cost to the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>Historically, the Government helped to fund the horse racing and breeding industries through the horse and greyhound racing fund, which included levies collected from bets placed in Ireland each year.  Until recently, the rate of betting tax levied in Ireland was one of the lowest of any country in the world.  Since it was decided in budget 2019 to increase the rate of betting tax from 1% to 2% of turnover, the yield has increased by more than &euro;50 million per annum.  This year, the amount of money raised from betting tax will be greater than the amount of money distributed to the horse and greyhound racing fund.  We believe there is an opportunity to put in place a long-term, secure and sustainable funding base that will allow this vibrant but vulnerable rural industry to maximise its potential.  This surplus can be used to invest in an industry that is delivering strongly for rural Ireland by protecting from the potential effects of Brexit and by copper-fastening the healthcare standards enjoyed by our horses.  Investment in this ambitious and realistic strategic plan will lead to increased employment across the villages and towns of Ireland.  I thank the committee for giving us an opportunity to discuss the industry and our plans.  I will be happy to address any questions that members of the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Senator Paul Daly is first up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#F00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important for me to record that I am the chairman of Kilbeggan racecourse and a horse breeder and owner.  I thank Mr. Hartery and Mr. Kavanagh for their presence here today and for their comprehensive report.  I would like Mr. Kavanagh to elaborate on some of the points he has made.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Deloitte report.  It should be read by anyone who is not in the circle and does not have a hands-on position in racing.  Mr. Kavanagh has highlighted figures which show that jobs are being created in serious numbers and a serious amount of money is being circulated in parts of rural Ireland where there are not many other opportunities.  The numbers of people attending race meetings and the betting figures are very positive.  I am delighted to hear such statistics and I welcome them.  Do we have any idea of the kind of age profile of those whose attendances are leading to the increased figures?  What cohort of people are we talking about?  Are foreign tourists coming in?  Have we harnessed a new Irish support base?  Are younger people coming in?  Is there further potential to be harnessed in this regard?<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more with what Mr. Kavanagh said about the funding needs of the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown.  Does he have any idea of how much a redevelopment project at the centre would cost?  If his wish list is accepted by the Minister, how does he propose that Horse Racing Ireland will come up with its side of the funding?  I do not doubt that additional funding would be needed.  I doubt that 100% funding would be provided.<\/p> <p>  As a representative of Kilbeggan, which is a small racetrack, I would like to ask about one of the major sources of income in racing at the moment, which is media rights.  These moneys are keeping many of the small racetracks going.  Brexit has been mentioned.  Where does Mr. Kavanagh envisage that media rights will go?  Are they under threat with Brexit in mind?  At the moment, the Racing UK channel is what it says on the tin.  It is possible, depending on how Brexit turns out, that the UK authorities will go on a solo run.  As Mr. Kavanagh has highlighted, they seem to be putting the foundations in place to promote their own industry.  If the links are not as strong after Brexit, does he believe this will be an issue for one of our major sources of funding on the ground?<\/p> <p>  That is it for the moment.  I compliment Mr. Kavanagh, Mr. Hartery and their team on the great work they are doing.  I suppose they are preaching to the converted here.  As I have said, it is important for other members of the committee to read the Deloitte report, which contains startling figures with regard to job creation in parts of rural Ireland where there are not many other employment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#F00300","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We will take the questions as they come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#F00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Okay.  The age profile among those who attend race meetings is better than Senator Daly might expect.  There is a difference between festival meetings and ordinary meetings.  The typical profile of a regular racegoer is older, male and rural, with a strong bias towards the farming community.  At the festival meetings, the balance is much better on a gender basis, on a demographic basis and on an age basis.  The statistics show that throughout the major festivals and the bigger meetings, we are looking at a 60:40 male-female spread.  There is an encouraging mix of younger people coming to the bigger meetings at racecourses like Galway, Punchestown and Leopardstown at Christmas.<\/p><p>There has been a focus on creating racing clubs in the universities.  Some race courses operate student days to try to attract the racegoers, owners and breeders of the future at a young age.  It is a concern that there is a difference between what one might describe as the more run of the mill race meetings and the festival meetings, but the mix is okay.<\/p><p> The proposed budget for the redevelopment of the equine centre is approximately &euro;22 million.  The intention is that, like some other capital projects in the industry, industry funding will be provided as well as Government funding.  We will look to fund this through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine capital funding budget.  We have had discussions with the Department about our ability to generate matching funding or funding on a two-for-one basis relative to the funding that comes from the Department to the industry.  That is what has happened in many racecourse developments recently.  HRI provides 40% of the funding of racecourse developments and the racecourse itself, through its own funds or through fundraising, provides 60%.  The budget is &euro;22 million with something like one third or two thirds provided by the State and industry.<\/p><p> The media rights are secure until 2023 and are in a good place.  The only issue relating to Brexit is its impact on sterling, as the deals are all in sterling so we could do with it strengthening a little to help the racecourses with their receipts.  I do not have a concern along those the Senator outlined about Ireland being excluded from media rights because the product is so strong and is in demand.  I attended Cheltenham last Saturday.  It was amazing, even at that English race meeting, how much focus there was on what was going on in Punchestown.  There was a big screen showing all the Punchestown races and when Faugheen won his race there, a huge cheer went up from the crowd.  As long as we keep our product strong and maintain quality, there will be a strong demand for media rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  According to the opening statement, there are encouraging signs of growth with the figure for horses-in-training up 3.5%, active owners increased 8.5% in the first six months of the year and new owners registered were up 9.5% while betting with on-course bookmakers rose by 11.5% in the first half of the year.  That is very positive from an industry perspective.  Later, Mr. Kavanagh stated racing is a \"vulnerable rural industry\" but those figures does not seem to bear this out, notwithstanding the issue of Brexit, to which I will return.  Can the delegation explain that a little?<\/p> <p>  The value of the industry is set out.  It provides approximately 1,200 jobs, direct and indirect, in the four midlands counties.  On Brexit, the statement suggested that British Government policy might try to tailor everything in such a way as to give the British horse racing industry a push ahead of the Irish sector.  With 80% of exports going to Britain, that has implications.  If Britain is going to put in place domestic policies that aggressively advantage the British breeding industry, as one would expect, what can be done here to counter that?  <\/p> <p>  What is the location of the all-weather track that is being planned?  <\/p> <p>  On the betting tax, HRI said the 2% increase brought in an additional &euro;50 million.

The vulnerability relates to the point which the Deputy touched on, namely that the British and Irish racing industries are really the one industry.  If one looks at today's card at any track in the UK, more than half the horses running will be Irish-bred, having been born and bred here and sold at a younger stage in life.  Many of the jockeys plying their trade in the UK are Irish.  If one goes into a betting shop in the UK, one will find Fairyhouse covered in the same way as any meeting in Britain.  We have been before this committee previously to discuss implications in areas such as animal movement where we have completely free movement of animals between Britain and Ireland or even across the Border under tripartite agreements.  That will change following Brexit and it will become more difficult to trade.  Some 1,500 mares a year come to Irish stallions from continental Europe.  They come through the landbridge of the UK.  Now, they will effectively come out of the EU into a third country, back into the EU to come to Ireland, then back out into a third country to go home through Britain.  The fear is that continental breeders will just think that it is easier for them to send their mare to a French stallion and they can stay at home.<\/p> <p>  I have no fears about the quality of our product.  The Irish horse is our biggest selling point.  Irish breeders produce very good horses and no matter what incentives other countries put in, no one can take that away.  However, one fear is if Britain starts putting in restrictions such as running races for British-bred horses only or they start offering premiums and additional prize money if a horse is British-bred or born rather than an Irish horse.  We are seeing signs of that.  Where before we would have had combined incentive schemes where premiums were paid, now there is a desire to move to a British point of view.  As an industry and as a country, we have always taken a very open outlook to the industry.  We are an exporting nation and our philosophy has not been to pursue restrictive policies.  We would have to invest in our industry here and ensure that the equine centre is built and provides adequate disease control.  We would have to look at our prize money levels relative to the UK and we would have to support our breeders with access to markets such as the UK.  The industry would be up for a fight like that; the issue is that it needs support and backing to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>What do we do post Brexit?

It is because the governments are satisfied that there are adequate disease control measures or disease prevention and veterinary standards in each of those countries that there is no risk in someone moving a high health racehorse from here to France.

All-weather racing keeps a whole host of small trainers in business in small rural parts of the country.  With our race programme, we are trying to balance some of the biggest and successful stables in the world which have a demand for a certain type of racing with the inclusiveness of a small trainer who is trying to compete.  All-weather racing has provided a strong outlet where several trainers have developed a successful business.  They can buy a string of horses to race on the all-weather tracks during the winter.  We see that is key to developing and continuing employment for flat trainers, in particular, as well as providing the potential for a start-up for young trainers.  We are keen to get moving on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>There is tremendous consistency with an all-weather surface.

There is a requirement for more racing.  We have been working with everybody to keep a balance because it is important to keep the excellent product that is there and to continue with that.<\/p> <p>  We have developed the strategic plan and brought it as far as we can at this stage.

However, there is a need for some fundamental realignment on the basis of which it is charged.  I am sure members have had plenty of engagement with the betting industry.  The betting tax yield this year will be just under &euro;100 million from a total turnover of over &euro;5 billion.  It is a relatively small figure.  Only five years ago, that figure was &euro;29 million, however.  Deputy Michael Noonan, the then Minister, took a two-step process whereby he extended betting tax to offshore betting.  Betting which takes place through the telephone or the Internet previously was escaping the tax net because it was routed through Gibraltar.  Legislation was brought in 2015 to ensure it was captured.  That increased the yield from &euro;25 million to &euro;50 million.  Last year, the rate of betting tax was increased to 2% and the yield on the first eight months will be close to &euro;100 million.<\/p> <p>  The issue with that is the tax is paid by the bookmaker which is a line in the bookmaker's profit and loss account.  This was a change introduced when Brian Cowen was Minister for Finance in 2006.  The bookmakers were lobbying at the time that the punters should not pay the tax.  Some of the bigger bookmakers told the punter they would absorb the tax, meaning smaller bookmakers could not compete with that.  As a result, the system was changed at the time where the tax was taken down from 2% to 1% but it was deemed the bookmaker should pay it rather than the punter.<\/p> <p>  We believe that is wrong.  If one looks at any other form of VAT are any other form of consumption tax, it is paid by the customer rather than the operator.  It led to a tax-free betting bonanza, possibly even fuelling excessive gambling and issues like that.<\/p> <p>  The tax yield is low relative to the level of betting activity that is going on.  We believe it could be increased.  If it were to be increased, the liability, some element or all of it, would have to switch back to the punter rather than the bookmaker.  It is at a point in the bookmaker's profit and loss account where they cannot afford to pay any more.  We do not believe if a punter has to pay 1% or 2% tax on betting, even if comes out of winnings as opposed to turnover, it would be an onerous burden.  We believe the State is not getting the yield out of its betting that it should do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Is there a turnover of &euro;5 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#H01300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":36,"content":"<p>It is &euro;5.2 billion<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Is that just on horseracing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#H01500","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>No, on everything.

The number has dropped substantially overall, however.  I would say there are about 40% of what they were five or seven years ago.  Are there figures for when on-course betting was at its peak?<\/p><p>I would like to get that figure because I was extremely concerned that the profession of on-course bookmakers was in terminal decline.  I am pleasantly surprised to see the turnover is up by that much.  That is a welcome development because our bookmaker is a key element of our day out and it brings a unique atmosphere to racing that one would not have with a Tote monopoly.  On the greyhound racing side, on-course bookmakers have disappeared and it inevitably affects the night out and the banter that is there.<\/p><p> As has been said by other speakers, all the increased figures for horses in training and for active owners are extremely welcome.  It is good to see the number of new owners up by virtually 10% as well.  It is a healthy sign of the industry whose importance to the rural economy has been stressed.  My local point-to-point race was on last Sunday and a horse was sold at that for a substantial sum.  The same man who sold the horse might have another 20 horses and not get another golden handshake but that is what keeps that part of the industry alive and it is extremely important.<\/p><p> With Brexit, the UK will try to protect its industry.  It can be said we are guilty of the same thing in Ireland.  We have our own European Breeders Fund, EBF, sales races for horses from EBF registered stallions.  If they start this in the UK and have confined races, we can take a bit of the blame ourselves in that we probably showed them a route to go in the way we were promoting our own sales and stallions.  I am not being critical but we definitely did that.  If we look at the national hunt, the UK consumer would get fairly browned off about only UK horses running.  If the French and Irish-bred horses were taken out of it, they would make up the vast majority of the top performers on the UK racing circuit.  While I could see it operating at a lower level such as the races in Sedgefield on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, I could not see it operating on a weekend circuit to have confined races for British thoroughbreds.  Maybe that is only wishful thinking but people go racing to see good horses running.  If there is to be discrimination against us, it will be done in another way to having confined races but we cannot ignore the threat of same.  If the door was closed for export into the UK or if it was made harder for us, the only industry that would be affected as badly by Brexit would be our beef industry.  The threat is huge.<\/p><p> On the proposed new all-weather track, the rumour is it would be in my county.  I question this.  We talk about the equine centre and money is a limited resource.  Do we need a second all-weather track?  I know the witnesses are saying we have a cohort of trainers in the Cork region who are travelling up to Dundalk for night meetings but do we fully utilise the Dundalk facility?  I do not know how many of these tracks are in the UK.  There are four, five or six and a few more have started in the recent past in the UK.  We only have one meeting a week in Dundalk.  Is it not possible on an all-weather track to have to two to three meetings per week?  The infrastructure for the racegoer on some of our smaller tracks around the country is in urgent need of refurbishment.  When HRI goes to the Government looking for money, its whole shopping list will not be catered for.  Should a second all-weather track be at the top of the agenda?  I am just asking the question for the sake of discussion.  Thurles Racecourse is my local course and it definitely needs serious upgrading, as does Clonmel Racecourse.  Those small rural tracks would have a huge appetite to soak up money for infrastructural improvements.  As HRI said, they are the lifeblood of the industry in winter time.  It is that rural racegoer who keeps those race meetings going.  I know serious refurbishment is ongoing in Leopardstown Racecourse and huge money has been spent on The Curragh Racecourse.  Those are the tracks that are catering for the festival meetings and all the rest but we have 26 tracks and if they were told grant aid was available, a lot of them would grab it with both hands.  I would have to be convinced about the fact that a second all-weather track should be top of the list in looking for capital investment.  I know it is rumoured it is coming to my county but even at that I would like to see the sums done and to see what else will be left waiting in the queue for investment if we put a significant amount of money into a second all-weather track.  I know a good amount of investment was made in The Curragh Racecourse by people heavily involved in the industry.  That was most welcome.  It is a showpiece stand and for the home of our classics that is the way it should be.  I would like to get into a debate about that matter.  There is a huge amount of money to be spent on different aspects of the industry.<\/p><p> The witnesses have responded to Deputy Stanley about the funding.  They said the punter should carry the cost of the betting tax.  It might work in practice in a betting office but it will not work on-course.  I know the witnesses said it should be taken out of the winnings.  I remember a time when betting tax was at 6.5% or 7% and one could pay it on if one was betting on-course and if one did not pay it on it was taken out of the winnings.  It definitely did not create consumer satisfaction.  Punters have become used to betting in what they consider to be a tax-free zone.  I would not worry too much about the bookmakers.  They will be able to protect their bottom line and margins in the prices they give.  The margin of the operator will be 110% or 115%.  I would be slow to go down the route of asking the consumer to pay.  It would meet serious resistance.  I am not saying we should not try to increase the tax take but to apply it to the consumer would be a retrograde step.  There would definitely be a serious kickback from punters who have grown accustomed to putting on their bet without having tax to pay.  At one stage the betting tax was 20% in betting shops.  We have definitely gone full circle from that but it would be hard to get consumers to buy back into that.  I was on Newstalk this morning and another Member of the Oireachtas was arguing this money should be distributed through all sports in the Exchequer fund.  That it is virtually self-generating at the moment helps the argument to keep it within Horse Racing Ireland and the greyhound racing industry.  I would not agree with Mr. Kavanagh that applying it to consumers would be the way forward.  That would be a retrograde step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#H01900","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Let me take some of the points the Deputies have made.

Clonmel is about to start a redevelopment project on its weigh room building, which we will support.  There is no question that the all-weather track will be done at the expense of other racecourses.  In the capital grant scheme, and this is unique among sports capital grants, we only put up 40% of the funding on behalf of the Government.  For many other sports capital grants, 80% to 100% of the funding is provided.  We try to leverage the racecourse to invest its own money.  As Senator Paul Daly knows, we work with the racecourses in terms of driving the racecourse to provide 60% of the funding.  We try to work with the racecourse on strict grant guidelines so the racecourse is not put in financial difficulty or does not over-stretch itself.  There are plenty of schemes available for the other tracks.  Some are more inclined to use them than others because it depends on their local financial position.<\/p> <p>  The chairman spoke about the second all-weather track and I will make a couple of other points.  There is a significant demand for further all-weather racing, not just from the horse racing population but also from the betting industry.  Internationally, it wants a consistent product on a fixed night at a fixed time with a standard number of runners.  Globally, the value in international betting on Irish racing is more in flat racing because there is no real culture of jump racing outside Britain, France and Ireland.  People want good flat racing.  Ireland is behind the curve relative to Britain and France.  France has nine or ten all-weather tracks and Britain has seven.  Ireland has one.  To an extent, in the business case for an all-weather track there is an element of self-financing it because there is a demand from the television companies and the betting companies will pay for media rights for the all-weather racing, which will cover much of the cost of the prize money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Is it not possible to utilise Dundalk for more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#K00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>One could use Dundalk 365 days of the year if one wished.  What we are examining from the industry's point of view is, first, a regional variation.  We have had many issues with trainers and their staff.  If one has a runner in the last race in Dundalk at 8.45 p.m. or 9 p.m. on a Friday and one is based in Waterford, Limerick or east Cork, one's staff are not getting home until 2 a.m. the next morning.  Second, there is a variety of surfaces developing as well so it is still under review.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's point about the British national hunt horse is well made.  Those horses are just not available.  The total number of British-bred national hunt horses each year is 600 or 700 foals so the British rely on Irish and French horses.  Their desire would be to revitalise the British breeding industry over time, and it will take time to come through the system, so they are not so dependent on the Irish product.  As I said, the Irish product will always have a quality edge or advantage, but it would be naive of us not to think we are in a competitive environment.  We do not want to be caught out by that.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the on-course bookmakers previously.  It is encouraging.  It is still a tough market for the bookmakers.  The 11% figure has continued through to the third quarter of the year, but the total on-course betting figure is approximately one third of what it was at its peak.  The figures for the Tote would be the same.  The nature of betting has changed.  It has gone mobile.  People are able to bet at the race track with their telephone and that is difficult.  We are trying to work with the on-course bookmakers.  I and the board share the Deputy's view that a race meeting without bookmakers would not be an attractive place, but there is a real challenge in that area.<\/p> <p>  On the betting tax, I take the Deputy's point in regard to punters, but it is difficult to justify, to somebody who is not interested in betting, having VAT on food, books and everything else and yet talk about the tax free consumption of gambling.  If the objective is to put in place proper funding structures rather than the Exchequer for things such as gambling addiction or to support sports such as horse racing, the consequence may be that one must question if it is wise to have such a liberal tax environment for gambling and to ask if that in some way fuels, and has fuelled, gambling levels over the years.

One could answer that across a broad spectrum.  At one level, racecourses are worth nothing.  They are effectively locked in to be used for racing.  Most of them are in rural areas and are of limited commercial potential.  A previous chairman used to say it would be easier to close a hospital in Ireland than to close a racecourse.  Ireland has a population of 6 million people and 26 racecourses while Hong Kong has 6 million people and two racecourses.  If one took a cold, hard business look at it, one would say there are too many racecourses.  However, the variety in the types of racecourses in the country is what gives Irish racing its broader charm, if I can call it that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the proposal of liquidating a racecourse, the only one worth talking about probably would be Leopardstown.  Leopardstown has a massive tradition.  It is over 100 years old and is racing's only outpost in Dublin.  We see in other countries that there is a disconnect between the population and horse racing.  They are urban societies and people do not see or grow up with horses.  They do not understand it.  That is not yet the case in Ireland but it might come down the line.  Leopardstown Racecourse has a very important role in keeping the flag flying for horse racing in Dublin.  There is a limited amount of land there to sell without compromising it as a racecourse.

There is opportunity for such development but it is limited largely to Leopardstown.  Most of the other 25 racecourses in the country are located in rural towns and are of limited value.  I did not misinterpret the Deputy's question.  I was just trying to give a broad picture.  Previous boards considered the development option and moved away from it, presumably for the same reasons it was not pursued at Lansdowne Road or Croke Park, for example.  Leopardstown is the headquarters of racing in Dublin and has significant tradition.  If one sells it, it is gone.  Part of it will be sold and that will assist the redevelopment of the racecourse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I listened to their opening remarks on my iPhone.  I welcome that Mr. Hartery highlighted that the Irish Equine Centre in Johnstown is HRI's first priority.  Having been there with Mr. Kavanagh on several occasions as well as with the Minister, I know that it needs considerable investment.  We hope that will happen.  It is operating on a shoestring.  Its facilities are quite deplorable and it is difficult for the staff to carry on their excellent work.  It has broadened its revenue streams to include areas other than equine activities.  I am delighted that it is a priority for the HRI.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the redevelopment of the Curragh racecourse and the associated problems.  The State probably owns two thirds of the Curragh through HRI and the Turf Club.  There has been a remarkable improvement in linkage locally since the appointment of Mr. Pat Keogh as CEO.  Trainers are seeking extra meetings at the racecourse.  It is a fine facility that should be used more often.  On the possibility of having a second track, has consideration been given to a private venture?  An offer has been made in respect of a track not far from where I live.<\/p> <p>  Has consideration been given to the American model, which involves racing in blocks such that horses can be stabled on site?  Many of the horses which run on the all-weather track in Dundalk do so regularly.<\/p> <p>  In the past year, there has been much debate in respect of funding of the horse racing and greyhound racing industries.  Would it be of benefit to horse racing for its funding to be separated from that of greyhound racing?  Would that be of assistance to HRI in terms of addressing certain negative messaging?<\/p> <p>  Several trainers in Ireland and the United Kingdom have left the business in the past 12 month.  Mr. Kavanagh referred in his opening statement to difficulties in particular areas.  If Joseph O'Brien of Kilkenny, Willie Mullins of Carlow, Noel Meade and Gordon Elliot of Meath or Coolmore of Tipperary pulled out, it would leave a significant hole in the local area.  Are we becoming too dependent on large operations such that small trainers do not have much of a chance?<\/p> <p>  I met Mr. Brian Cusack who is looking after the Tote and coming forward with several ideas in that regard.  Reference was made to the betting tax, which does not apply to the Tote.  Bookmakers pay the tax of 2% but there is nothing coming from the Tote.  Should it also pay the 2% tax?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Kavanagh referred in his opening statement to the betting tax on racing.  Most of the money recouped by the betting tax could be asserted to come from matters other than horse racing.  What percentage of the moneys accrued comes from racing?  It comes from greyhound racing, football matches and so on.  Do the witnesses have a breakdown in that regard?<\/p> <p>  There are staffing problems in the hospitality and other sectors.  Is staffing a problem in the equine industry?  Is there regular engagement between HRI, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, on easing the visa situation for staff coming into the country?<\/p> <p>  I have not seen figures in respect of staffing within HRI, such as its staffing complement or the increase in staffing in recent years.  In 2016, 8,561 horses were in training.  In 2018, there were 8,688, which is a minor increase.  Almost half that number of horses were in training each day over the relevant period.  Has the staffing level of HRI increased in the past three or four years?  Why does its staffing level need to increase?  For example, there were 1,000 more runners in 2017 than in 2016, but only 40 more runners in 2018 than in 2017.  What is the basis of the staffing strategy of HRI?<\/p> <p>  Overall, the HRI needs to send a message.  The industry is worth &euro;1.8 billion.  Foal sales such as those currently under way at Goffs generate significant income.  I must give credit to Goffs and Tattersalls.  Mr. Kavanagh was at a sale last weekend in Cheltenham.  It is fantastic that Irish horses are being sold on the UK market.  What Goffs and Tattersalls are doing for the industry is significant.  Sheikh Mohammed flew into Dublin Airport by private jet and spent a significant amount of money at Goffs.  Big money is also being spent at Tattersalls.  The top end of the market in the industry is healthy, but at the lower end it is very difficult for smaller breeders and so on.<\/p> <p>  As the witnesses are probably aware, I am a big supporter of horse racing.  A model is needed that will entice a person going to a race meeting with &euro;50 in his or her pocket to spend that money while also encouraging him or her to attend another meeting.  Those charged too much at the gate are not inclined to return.  The Lawlor's of Naas novice hurdle is the only grade 1 race at Naas racecourse.  Lawlor's Hotel gives out so many free tickets to the meeting that there is a large crowd at it.  People have a great time and spend &euro;50 on bets, drink or food.  I agree with Michael O'Leary that customers should not be given something for nothing.  It would encourage more people to come racing if they were charged a minimal amount for entry, such as $2 as is the case in parts of the United States or &euro;5 with a race card or similar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#L00200","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>If a person attending a race meeting goes home with &euro;50, he or she could go back the next day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#L00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>There is scope to increase participation.

Certainly I re-echo what was said about the equine centre in Johnstown, and it is the priority on our list because there was a very serious concern early this year with influenza, and that was managed very well by different groups within our organisation, the IHRB and the equine centre.  One begins to understand when one has potential crises on one's hands how fit-for-purpose the equine centre is.  The Minister knows it, and I think he is a big supporter of the redevelopment of Johnstown.<\/p> <p>  Senator Lawlor lives very close to the Curragh and from an operating point of view, significant changes have occurred there.  We are pleased with the changes that have occurred.  From an operations point of view, we are looking forward to a very strong 2020 in the Curragh.  In terms of the investment and the private investors who have put &euro;36 million into the project, we and HRI did matching funds as the committee will be aware.  The total cost of the project was &euro;81.8 million.  The submitted budget figure was &euro;73 million.  A number of items were added back, which was necessary, and that would probably have brought it up to &euro;75 million or &euro;76 million.  Then one had inflation adjustments, and that tells one where the gaps are in funding and so forth.  We have some work to do in that space among ourselves and with the private investors, but we are very pleased with where the Curragh sits currently from an ongoing operational point of view and so forth and we are happy with the changes that have occurred there with the Curragh board.<\/p> <p>  On the private venture, we certainly have been engaged, and as Mr. Kavanagh is the person who has engaged in that process, I will let him speak about it.  He spoke about the southern model we looked at, but thought has gone into it around an American-type model where one trains on track and so forth and maybe he will explain some of that as well.<\/p> <p>  There are a lot of young trainers coming up in the business, and some of them who started ten years ago are quite large today.  One is going to have that evolution going on in the industry where change is happening.  A number of them were mentioned.  I think as long as the quality stays up there, it will be good for the industry, but the whole thing for me is maintaining the quality, so that when we go abroad to compete, we compete very favourably, which we have done for many years.  We need to continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicky Hartery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>To pick up on a couple of the other points, I refer to the all-weather evaluation.

There are different issues with each of those, but certainly there were three private ventures that expressed an interest, including one in County Kildare, which I am sure the Senator is familiar with.<\/p> <p>  On blocks of racing situated on site, I do not think that is a runner because we have 26 racecourses.

They have not gotten to it in Dundalk.  I do not know whether it is because it is horses and greyhounds together or for some other reason.  I know they use Dundalk significantly outside race meetings for training galloping horses, but the horses are all visitors.  They are not stabled on site.  It is not something that we have come across.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about separate funding.  I do not know if it is an issue.  It may be something that people look at.  There is a rigid formula of 80:20.  Equally, a lot of people who are interested in horses are interested in dogs as well and<i>vice versa<\/i>.  There is an overlap between the two, and we speak with the people in Bord na gCon on an ongoing basis.  Whether the funding should be together or separate, it is not for us to decide.  Certainly, as I said, there is an overlap in rural communities in both sectors.  The point was very well made on the dependence of rural areas on big trainers and I think this is a positive for us.  I think Alan Dukes did a survey ten years ago that said that within a five mile or a ten mile radius of a small town like Bagenalstown in Carlow, 600 jobs are created by Willie Mullins, Jim Bolger, local stud farms, Red Mills horse feeds, vets and point-to-point developers.  The point was well made that if one had a factory coming to Bagenalstown that was going to create 600 full-time jobs, the country would make every effort to attract it.  Here is an indigenous industry creating those jobs.<br\/><br\/>In addition to Bagenalstown, one reads about Piltown in County Kilkenny, Gordon Elliot in Summerhill in County Meath, Jessica Harrington in Moone in County Kildare and Aidan O'Brien in Rosegreen in Tipperary.  There is no one else creating this sort of employment in villages and towns around the country.  That is the real backbone of this industry and it is not an east coast Dublin-centric IT-based industry.  It is spread throughout rural Ireland, it is bringing international money in, and it is putting jobs right into the heart of rural areas.  I know there is a big debate going on within politics at the moment about rural-urban Ireland.  Racing certainly has its part to play, so I think that is a really good point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>That is a huge message that we have to get out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#M00700","speaker":"1438"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>As Mr. Kavanagh highlighted, if there were 600 jobs in a factory coming to Bagenalstown, the Chairman would be all over it.

About half the total betting is in shops and about half of it is online.  Within the shops, approximately 70% of the betting is on horses and dogs and with about 30% on other activities.  Online it is about 50:50.  At times there is a perception that it is not all betting on horses and dogs but the point one has to remember is that golf betting is sporadic.  There are only four majors a year, whereas horseracing and greyhound racing are every day.  It is a 365 day a year offering.  It is the staple product of the betting industry.  It is about 70:30 in shops and about 50:50 online.<\/p> <p>  We have a lot of challenges in staffing.  Trainers and breeders are struggling to get and to keep staff.  We are trying to invest in programmes that will help them acquire staff, and we are engaged with the Department of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to try to assist in improving the pipeline of staff within the industry.  Our staff numbers are broadly similar.  There are about 180 staff, including in the subsidiaries.  Horse Racing Ireland has three subsidiaries: HRI Racecourses Limited, which operates four racecourses, the Tote and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing.  Between those subsidiaries and Horse Racing Ireland itself, there are about 180 staff working out of Ballymany, and that is probably about four or five up on the situation three or four years ago.  The extra areas that have required investment are increased compliance requirements in areas like procurement and purchasing.  As I said, we have invested staff in the whole education and welfare of people and welfare of horses.  The staff are the backbone of the organisation, are very committed to the industry and are mostly based locally in Kildare.  We run, as I said, the back-of-office of elements of racecourses like Leopardstown, Fairyhouse, Tipperary and Navan.  They are run out of the headquarters in Kildare.<\/p><p> The Tote is a different form of betting.  It is a pool form of betting.  We are having a strategic look at the Tote anyway.  The Tote pays gambling regulatory charges for betting that it does on UK betting, and I know there is talk about a new gambling regulator in Ireland.  One of the issues being looked at is the taxation status of the Tote.  The Tote is suffering the same struggles as on-course bookmakers, to which Deputy Cahill referred, and we are in discussions with a number of parties with regard to the future of the Tote and we will be bringing some strategic options to our December board meeting on it.  The taxation system is different.  It is a pool betting where an element is taken out and the rest is returned back to punters.  Should the Tote pay 2%?  I do not believe it should because it is a different type of betting.  With the establishment of a new gambling regulator, that may be something that will be looked at differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2019111900002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh.

Just to give the history, all-weather racing first came into the UK in the early 1990s.  During a very cold winter, there had been no racing for almost two months and the betting shops came to a stand-still.  They had jump racing on the all-weather, so they jumped hurdles, and it proved a safety hazard because horses were sliding on landing.  It was never run again.<\/p> <p>  Dundalk had been pursuing us, saying it would like to experiment with jump racing again but, as Senator Daly said, one was not jumping on the all-weather track.  It was going to put a grass strip on the back straight and on the finishing straight, on the outside and the inside of that, on which they would have hurdles, so they would switch from all-weather racing on the flat to a strip of three hurdles and go over the jumps.<\/p> <p>  We concluded that it was not practical because if one were to put on all-weather jump racing, one would either have to fund it as extra fixtures, which was a funding challenge, or one would have to say to other tracks - dare I say tracks like Kilbeggan or Clonmel - that one was taking a fixture away from them and putting it in Dundalk.  We felt that was not fair to those tracks.  Dundalk would still perhaps have an ambition to explore that further, but we ruled it out at the time.  As I said earlier, there is no interest internationally in taking signals from jump racing like that.

I am delighted to have this opportunity and look forward to engaging fully with the committee.  There are some particular themes contained in the statement which relate directly to my view of the role of Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, chairperson, while also speaking to my own formation and interests.  I hope that by taking this approach I will be informing the committee with a strong sense of who I am and how I will approach the role to which I have been nominated.  Broadly speaking, these themes are the social impact of LIT, especially in the area of access; the regional dimension; the technological university consortium with Athlone Institute of Technology; and, finally, apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>  I am a native of Dublin and got all my education there, graduating with a degree in commerce at UCD.  My parents had a business in the Liberties.  We lived over the shop and I was probably the first person in the area to graduate from university.  It was an area of great deprivation and I saw at first hand the role education could play in lifting the lives of the people.  This was a life lesson.  My first job was with the Dublin Health Authority as a home assistance officer working with some of Dublin&rsquo;s forgotten people.  <\/p> <p>  Limerick has been my home for more than 50 years.  When the regional tourism organisations were established, I got a position with Shannonside Regional Tourism in Limerick.  I started my own business, Limerick Travel, in 1971.  This continues to be one of Munster&rsquo;s leading travel agencies.  Married with three grown boys, I have always been involved in the life of the region because I believe in the importance of regional development.  I have seen this evolve over the years, having been chairman of Shannonside Regional Tourism and a member of the Hunt Museum, the Junior Chamber Limerick, and Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital.  I have also been chair of the Shannon Region Conference and Sports Bureau, as well as serving on the boards of Bord F&aacute;ilte, Aer Rianta, Shannon Development and the Shannon Group.<\/p> <p>  I have always had a deep interest in education as a means of giving a future to our children.  I have served on Limerick city's education committee and Limerick and Clare education and training board, where I was finance chairman.  In addition, I have served on the boards of a number of DEIS schools.  I joined the governing body of LIT in 2017 and am chairperson of the finance and physical development committee.  I am also a member of the strategy committee, which developed LIT&rsquo;s current strategy, as well as of the appointments committee.  It is against this background that I feel I have marshalled the experience and ability to approach the role of chairperson of LIT.<\/p> <p>  In illustrating my approach to the priorities of LIT, I draw members&rsquo; attention to the HEA&rsquo;s recent spatial and socioeconomic profile of higher education institutions in Ireland.  In this, the composition of LIT&rsquo;s student body is clearly spelled out.  The institution very closely reflects the diversity and social mix of the region&rsquo;s population.  Some 15% of our students come from deprived areas while 8% come from affluent areas.  This proven ability to provide access to higher education as part of our everyday business is crucial, and serves to support individuals, their families, their communities and ultimately the economy of the region.  More than two thirds of our students are in receipt of grants and many are, like me, first generation college-goers.  On 30 October, the HEA published our institutional compact profile, which reinforces all of this.  I also note the importance of the fact that 17% of our first year undergraduates are mature students.  <\/p> <p>  Of course, these statistics reflect our impact on society but I see it as very important that we also have an economic impact.  LIT&rsquo;s proposed Coonagh campus is specifically intended as a centre of excellence to bring together academia and the engineering industry of the mid-west.  This kind of project can have a very real impact and is an area I strongly wish to see developed.  Coonagh is also ideally positioned to enable LIT to extend its offering of apprenticeships, in particular those which are targeted at high-tech manufacturing.<\/p><p>These programmes are developed with industry and we offer engineering degrees in industrial electrical engineering and in manufacturing engineering by apprenticeship.  Indeed, last month saw the first graduates from this programme.  I believe that Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, now has a very solid foundation upon which to grow our apprenticeship offering, the value of which I know the members already appreciate.<\/p><p> It is also worth noting that three quarters of our students come from within the region and two thirds work in the region after graduating which is a very important engine of growth for the mid-west.<\/p><p> The great strategic development of the next period will be the formation of a new technological university in partnership with Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT.  This new entity will allow a university-level education to be made available locally to a great proportion of the country.  The LIT-AIT consortium is the first to be formed since the passage of the Technological Universities Act and I see it as something which can be of great benefit in our regions.  I am now ready to play my part in driving this consortium to its logical conclusion in a new institution.<\/p><p> I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the work of Mr. Niall Greene, my predecessor as chairperson of LIT, who steered the institute into a position where it has been able to deliver for the region and can legitimately aspire to achieve its strategic goals for the benefit of society.<\/p><p> I thank the Chair and members of the committee for this opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Brazil","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I should explain that priority questions on education are coming up in the D&aacute;il and that explains why there are very few committee members here today.

We are hoping those funds will be released shortly so that we can proceed to open the campus there next September.  It will have capacity for 800 students and we are very excited about that.  It is a critical piece of the architecture of the formation of the college because we need more space.  When students leave the Moylish campus, a public private partnership, PPP, will come on board.  We have signed a memorandum of understanding preliminary to the building of a four-storey ICT building on that site.<br\/><br\/>The preparation for the progression to a technological university is a great challenge.  There is good news in that LIT has some experience, having worked to blend the Tipperary institute into LIT.  We have good experience of the communication and leadership skills that are needed.  There is no doubt that there have been speed bumps in the negotiations with AIT, but the people involved are sensible.  The executives on both sides have been meeting and the boards will be meeting soon in that regard.  There will be progress.<br\/><br\/>The big step in the development of the technological university is the fact that the Government has committed to a fund of &euro;90 million over three years to assist.  We need to strengthen in some areas, including an increase in the number of PhD people on the staff, more postgraduate courses and more research work.  We are confident that, given the funds that are likely to be available, we will be in a position to do that.<br\/><br\/>Another good thing is that AIT and LIT complement one another.  The two institutions do not pirate students in the sense that the core areas from which the two institutions draw students do not necessarily overlap.  In reality, there is very little haemorrhage of people from the mid-west into Athlone and, similarly, from Athlone into Limerick.  That makes for an easy transition.  In addition, a number of the courses that one institution or the other are doing will now work in tandem.  There is already goodwill.<br\/><br\/>We do not have a timescale for the process but a couple of years will see considerable change and it is hoped this will become a reality.  The executives on both sides are sensible so I see no reason this will not become a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>LIT works very closely with SOLAS on apprenticeships.  Our <i>modus operandi<\/i>in LIT is to embrace our partners in industry and commerce around us.  We have very good, close relationships with all of those people.  We will, next year, start some wet trade apprenticeships that had fallen off a cliff during the recession.  We are very much up for all of that.<br\/><br\/>I will give the committee a good example where we are involved with apprenticeships.  Lufthansa at Shannon has an important maintenance unit.  We are now working with Lufthansa so that their apprentices can work through us to gain bachelors of engineering degrees.<br\/><br\/>Talking about apprenticeships generally, I have been involved in career guidance for a long time.  It is unfortunate that many people, particularly parents, see apprenticeships as they were in the old days where the apprentice was the gofer person.  The apprentice nowadays goes right up to level 9 in university standing and we really need to reinvent the title &quot;apprentice&quot; so that is understood.  From a career guidance perspective, we probably need to go right back to the last year of primary school to get people to understand that apprenticeships are a better way of life.  I read a report recently from someone in the career guidance sector who previously spoke to the committee.  That report referred to a woman with four postgraduate qualifications who, every time she passed a building site, envied the people there driving big cars and earning much more money than she was.<\/p><p>We do a great deal of work in the culinary area in LIT, and it is the same problem with the attitude to catering.  Many parents and families believe that catering is pot-walloping as opposed to being something for which people can get good training and professional development.  As I know from my side of the business, head chefs in many leading hotels can earn nearly as much as the chief executive.  There is a need to do something about that attitude.<\/p><p> On access, I mentioned earlier that I am involved in DEIS schools.  Currently, eight students from an adjacent DEIS school - Thomond community college, which the Acting Chairman will know - are in first year at LIT.  We have provided a fund of just under &euro;1 million for scholarships exclusive to DEIS pupils who otherwise might not be able to get to university.  We believe that is a significant step for us to take.  As we speak, approximately 55 or 60 students are on courses at LIT under that guise and we are delighted to be able to do that.  It shows our intent to provide for people who otherwise might not attend university.  The experience in the college is that those students often become the best students.  They finish their course and always emerge with flying colours, which we are proud of.<\/p><p>  I hope I have answered all the questions that were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Brazil","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brazil.

The delivery of literacy programmes by ETBs is guided by the SOLAS further education and training strategy of 2014 to 2019, inclusive, which outlines a framework and implementation plan to support economic development and increase social inclusion.  Historically, the term &quot;literacy&quot; was a measurement of reading and writing, but this has evolved a great deal over time.  It is now considered in a much broader context and includes, at a minimum, numeracy, as well as digital literacy.<br\/><br\/>As for the benefits of improving literacy, in addition to improved reading, writing, numeracy and ICT skills, substantial Irish and international research has shown that participation in adult literacy provision has a positive personal and social impact on individuals and communities.  Learners from ETB programmes have provided a wealth of evidence on the benefits they have experienced by participating in adult literacy programmes.  The ETBI-SOLAS-NALA national adult literacy awareness campaign, which takes place every September, has developed video clips, which are available on <i>takethefirststep.ie<\/i>.  The awareness campaign has proven to be one of the most successful methods of promoting the benefits of returning to education for those with low levels of literacy.<br\/><br\/>The barriers to participation in further education have been found to include low confidence and self-esteem, negative experiences of education, physical barriers such as childcare and transport, the suitability of courses, and a lack of awareness of further education and training opportunities.<br\/><br\/>The adult literacy programmes provided by ETBs are primarily focused on learning outcomes at the national framework of qualifications levels 1 to 3, inclusive, with progression options to higher levels, as well as unaccredited options.<\/p><p>The priority cohorts to target for literacy programmes are adults with primary education or less and whose literacy and numeracy skills do not equate to at least level 3 on the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, and adults who may have upper second level education but whose literacy and numeracy skills are still less than or equivalent to NFQ level 3.  Within those two cohorts there are individuals and groups who experience particular and acute barriers to participation.  Those groups include people who are long-term unemployed, lone parents, Travellers, migrants, older people, people with disabilities, disadvantaged women and men particularly those living in rural isolation, people who are homeless and ex-offenders.<br\/><br\/>Education and training board, ETB,  adult literacy programmes provide a core service of group literacy and numeracy in the main and information and communications technology, ICT, tuition.  That provision is available during the daytime and evenings.  We also provide family literacy, English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, and skills for work provision for people who are in employment and who have low levels of literacy.  Typically, that provision would take place in either further education and training centres belonging to ETBs or community settings.  The link to the community is important.  Tuition is typically provided to groups ranging between four and eight learners for up to eight hours a week.  It includes intensive literacy, a themed literacy option and supports such as study skills and educational guidance.  We offer skills assessment to everybody who is coming into the programmes, both accredited and unaccredited.  Tuition is then based on what that assessment shows.  More recently, we have provided tailored literacy support to apprenticeship programmes because evidence shows many apprentices  struggle with the maths and  literacy dimensions of their respective apprenticeship programmes.  The demand for those supports has risen rapidly in 2019.<br\/><br\/>D&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag iarraidh feabhas a chur ar a gcuid scileanna tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, t&aacute; an togra 'Breacadh' againn agus t&aacute; sin lonnaithe i nGaillimh.

The staff would be very conscious and sensitive to the challenges learners with low levels of literacy are experiencing in coming into programmes.<br\/><br\/>There were 59,000 beneficiaries in adult literacy provision in ETBs in 2018 and there were 58,000 up to the end of 2019.  It seems reasonable to assume that more than the number last year will avail of the services this year.  ETBs offer an extensive range of programme options.  There are group tuition, accredited programmes and themed literacy and digital literacy programmes.  We are aware there is a need for accessible and clear information as a driver for people with low levels of literacy and the information would be proofed in terms of plain English.  We have open days, information sessions, radio interviews with existing learners, social media usage and so on.  We still get many people participating in our programmes through word of mouth and through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We used to get women referring both themselves and men but that has changed slightly.  That is as a consequence of groups such as men's sheds and so on.  <br\/><br\/>Lack of childcare supports and easy access to transport, particularly in rural areas, can be barriers to participation.  Lack of clarity on Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection benefits and retention of them can also be a barrier.

My presentation has two parts.  The first part is concerned with why we continue to have a significant adult literacy issue in Ireland and the second will outline a new approach to be considered for addressing adult literacy needs at this time.<br\/><br\/>One in six adults, aged 16 to 64, scored at the lowest level of literacy on a five-point scale in the latest survey that was conducted.  That means more than 500,000 adults have difficulty reading and understanding a leaflet, bus timetable or medicine instructions.  Similarly, one in four scored at the lowest level of numeracy.  This equates to more than 750,000 adults not being able to do basic calculations such as dividing up a bill.  Literacy and numeracy needs have grave consequences for the individuals concerned and there is much research to paint the relationship between that and poorer health, weak employment and earning potential, less involvement in society as well as intergenerational disadvantage for children and families.  It costs our society and economy in both productivity and welfare dependence. <br\/><br\/>The results for Ireland chime with the profile of educational attainment levels of the workforce, with more than 445,000 people of working age with less than an upper secondary qualification.  Ireland has the highest number of 30 to 34 year olds with higher education and among the highest number of older workers without upper secondary education representing a serious intergenerational rupture.  It is time to prioritise the furthest behind first.<br\/><br\/>The 2012 OECD adult skills survey provides the most up-to-date statistics on the adult literacy and numeracy levels of those of working age since the most recent survey was conducted in 1997.  Back then, the poor results for Ireland propelled significant action that saw annual increases in participation and resources for the next decade.  However since 2009, and despite the very disappointing results of the adult skills survey in 2012, investment and participation rates have stagnated. <br\/><br\/>The first national skills strategy in 2007 set the target to reduce the numbers of adults with less than upper secondary education to 7%.  While school and higher education performance targets were reached or surpassed, we failed to reach the low skills target and the same target was rolled over into the current national skills strategy to be achieved by 2020, and with 17% of those aged 25 to 65 without an upper secondary qualification, this target will clearly not be reached.  That fact alone illustrates the inadequacy of the current approach and resources to tackle the scale of both the adult literacy and numeracy issue in Ireland as well as those with low levels of educational attainment.  There remains an outdated view that this challenge will fade with time-based school attendance levels.  In reality, there is a crisis in the learning outcomes for many in society, both young and old.  While acknowledging the contribution of the Department of Education and Skills, Education and Training Boards Ireland and ETBs, which cater for approximately 60,000 participants in their literacy services, this equates to approximately 12% of those with needs and costs less than approximately &euro;600 per person per annum.  It is clear we need a better resourced and more co-ordinated effort by Government.  <br\/><br\/>Currently, NALA is working bilaterally with nine Departments and their agencies on policies aimed at building literacy and numeracy competence in a number of areas, including health and finance.  This experience, along with similar recent developments to address the adult literacy and numeracy issue in countries such as the Netherlands, Portugal, Finland and Belgium has guided NALA to call for a whole-of-Government approach that would bring a co-ordinated national effort to radically reducing the numbers of people with literacy and numeracy needs.<br\/><br\/>Literacy is a barometer of equality and changes people's lives.  Ireland can do better to give everyone a fair chance to thrive in their literacy development.  This requires investing in people who have not benefited practically at all from our education system during the bust or the boom.  This requires greater prioritisation within Government so that we can see an alignment of adult literacy policies and strategies across all Departments.<br\/><br\/>I thank members for listening.  Our written submission has more detail on our vision for literacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Inez Bailey"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bailey for her presentation.

Good literacy skills equip citizens to participate in education, work and society.  The Department of Education and Skills prioritises supporting literacy acquisition both in childhood and throughout adult life.  Definitions of \"literacy\" shift over time but what is consistent is that literacy should be viewed as a continuum.  There is not a binary position whereby a person is literate or illiterate.  Every person in this room is placed somewhere along the literacy continuum.  Literacy is also not fixed.  Like any skill, it must be used to be maintained.  Conceptions of literacy are broadening to include areas such as digital literacy, financial literacy, health literacy and media literacy.<\/p><p>To have good literacy skills, a person must be able to apply them in a range of situations and to a range of texts and media.<br\/><br\/>As members will know, on the whole, children in Ireland perform very well in international surveys of literacy but the position for the adult population is somewhat less positive.  Ireland participated in the first round of the OECD's programme for the international assessment of adult competencies, PIAAC, survey in 2011 and 2012, as Ms Bailey has outlined, which was undertaken to provide data on key adult skills, namely, literacy, numeracy and the somewhat inelegantly titled problem-solving in technology-rich environments.  The survey found that, on the literacy scale, Irish adults achieved around the survey average, placing it 19 out of the 34 countries that have participated to date.  The distribution of performance in Ireland across the population was more even than in many countries.  This means that it has relatively fewer people at the lowest and highest levels of the scale.  Just under 18% of Irish adults scored at or below level 1 on the survey, which was an improvement from the 22% who scored at those levels in a comparable international survey undertaken in the 1990s.<br\/><br\/>The further education and training, FET, sector offers a wide range of courses, primarily through the 16 ETBs designed to lead to greater social inclusion, high quality skills supply for the economy and progression opportunities within education.  For some people, difficulties with literacy or numeracy can present a real obstacle to further learning.  A key central aim of FET policies and strategies is to ensure that programmes and services are accessible to all learners.  The FET strategy for 2014 to 2019 prioritises literacy and numeracy supports, both through the delivery of dedicated adult literacy courses and through supporting the literacy of all learners who engage with further education and training.  Targets are set for the ETBs in this area through their strategic performance agreements and planning frameworks with SOLAS.  More than &euro;800 million is invested annually in the FET sector.  Literacy and numeracy are key components of all FET programmes.  Transversal skills, such as literacy and numeracy, form part of the Quality and Qualification Ireland, QQI, award standards in the FET sector and support for best practice regarding integrating literacy and numeracy in broader FET programmes is set out in the SOLAS report, Integrating Literacy &amp;amp; Numeracy<i>.  <\/i>Within the overall investment in FET, approximately &euro;35 million is spent annually on dedicated adult literacy programmes.  As the committee has heard, over 6,000 people participate in those programmes annually.  An important task of the adult literacy service through its English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, provision is to welcome and support a diverse cohort of &quot;new Irish&quot; people.  These new community members in Ireland come from a wide range of cultural, linguistic, educational and social backgrounds and the ETBs design and deliver programmes tailored to their needs.<br\/><br\/>Building on the substantial level of adult literacy and numeracy education already delivered in the FET sector, the Government has focused increasingly in recent years on the needs of vulnerable people in employment.  Initiatives such as Skills to Advance and the EXPLORE programme offer targeted support for employees in lower-skilled jobs who need to adapt to a changing work environment.  These initiatives are also a significant part of the Department of Education and Skills national effort to implement the European Commission's upskilling pathways recommendation, which aims to help adults acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills.

Is there a figure for what it costs the State if there are 750,000 people with numeracy problems?  What is the cost of not having people at a certain level of literacy and numeracy?  Health has been mentioned, along with being able to engage with politics and the education system.  This has a detrimental effect on society.  Could we flip the conversation and look at the cost to the State of people not having literacy and numeracy skills rather than how much it costs to provide the service?<\/p> <p>  Is there less awareness and understanding of learning difficulties relating to numeracy and dyscalculia and a resistance to acknowledge this within the education sector?  I know at leaving certificate level there are no extra points or allowances if a person has dyscalculia.  I could be corrected but, as far as I am aware, Trinity is the only university that gives a maths waiver.  Have our guests come across many people with undiagnosed dyscalculia and is there a lack of a real will to address it as a learning difficulty?<\/p> <p>  We have heard that children achieve certain scores and there is a big gap when we consider adult scores.  Adults have different types of engagement than children.  A young person in sixth year may want to attend university but the parents may not be from a professional background or have the same level of literacy.  They may not have the literacy to navigate a system of application forms for colleges and points or SUSI applications.  Sometimes that level of literacy might be completely missing within the family; it would not matter if there is a high level of literacy in children because they would not engage with that type of literature anyway.  What impact does this have on a child who may have scored highly in literacy throughout school?  What type of impact does an intergenerational literacy deficit have within the family?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#F00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I am not a member of this committee but I am a member of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There is a clear overlap.  Ms Gallagher indicated that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is both the path of referral and there may be anxiety about a lack of clarity with respect to the retention of benefits.  The committee of which I am a member has had much discussion about how to ensure people are given literacy or educational options when they are in contact with employment services.  For example, people may have much anxiety if they are put through the JobPath scheme or they be concerned about losing entitlements.  What does a positive or negative invitation to engage with these services look like?  How do we ensure that people who may have literacy issues are being identified either by Intreo, the Department or JobPath in order that literacy needs can be addressed rather than a person being moved to a low-skilled job, for example, while he or she still has literacy and numeracy issues that have not been dealt with?<\/p> <p>  I have a question on pathways that could be addressed to any of the witnesses but particularly Mr. O'Flaherty as he spoke of further education and training.  I know many people go to citizen information services when they do not feel they can access information online or understand leaflets.  Could citizen information services be potential referral pathways to identify people who may have needs and supports?  The figure of 12% of those in need being addressed has been mentioned.  Will our guests comment on where they feel resources need to be allocated most in order to achieve the 7% target for people having a secondary education from the current figure of 17%?  Is there a flexibility in those schemes?  Are they part-time or full-time?  What kind of commitment do they require if people are working or managing care needs?  Are the schemes working in bringing people who may be harder to reach into the process?<\/p> <p>  I was struck by the comment about reading a leaflet and the lowest points of literacy.  Many people become aware of literacy issues when they fail some bureaucratic test in not getting a form back in time or losing a hospital appointment.  Should there be a flagging system when these literacy problems are encountered so that people can be directed to support?<\/p><p>That is instead of just losing out, which is what happens, certainly in terms of people trying to navigate social welfare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#F00400","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>It is useful to have Senator Higgins here in light of her experience with the other committee.  There is obviously an interrelation between different Departments and committees.  I wish to add some questions.  I have a question for Ms Gallagher on the issue of people who are hard to reach.  How do we bring in people who clearly will have difficulty with or a fear of engaging with various services, and difficulty in acknowledging and recognising the issues they have?  Ms Gallagher mentioned people coming in through the Men's Sheds, which is an interesting way, and also through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  What we would really like to get to in this committee is how we can improve opportunities and access for people who have difficulty with literacy.  That is my first issue.<\/p> <p>  Second, Mr. O'Flaherty talked about Ireland's score in the PIAAC survey, which is not great as we are 19th out of 34.  Ms Bailey talked about the national skills strategy and the targets therein.  Will she expand on the aims within the national skills strategy, the percentages and what we need to do to reach the targets in the national skills strategy up to 2025?  We need to be able to measure where we are going and what we are achieving, and how to get to the point we want to get to, where literacy is not a struggle for so many people.<\/p> <p>  Third, I want to ask Ms Bailey about the issue of struggling with language, to which Senator Higgins referred, for example, the difficulty of facing bureaucracy, etc.  Ms Bailey's organisation has been campaigning for the use of plain language for a long time, so she might respond in regard to the difficulties people face, given the language used by bureaucracy, and what progress is being made.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Gallagher to respond first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#G00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I am not sure if I got all of the questions but a number of them overlap to some extent.  With regard to how to bring in people, in our experience, people need to want to come in.  Very often, people come in when they are at a turning point in their lives or when there is some crisis that precipitates that engagement.  It could be something personal, for example, the break-up of a relationship, a divorce or something like that, where the other partner has been doing all of the paperwork.  People often come in when their children start school and they realise their six-year old is galloping past them in terms of literacy.  It could be something like progression at work, where they realise they would like to apply for promotion and they cannot do that.  It has to reach a particular point before people want to come in.<\/p> <p>  We get referrals in all sorts of ways and we do all sorts of things ourselves in terms of social media, open days and liaising with community groups, which is very important.  Community groups tend to know the people who may have difficulties with literacy.  ETBs are very good at having a reach into communities, which is a very important part of what we do.  It is about trying lots of different ways.  There is no one easy way.<\/p> <p>  The other thing is that just because they come in once, it does not mean they are going to stay.  They might come in to get some information but that might be the end of it, so we need to follow that up and have lots of engagement with them.  That is time consuming and costly.  There is no quick win, and that is what we have learned over the years.  It is time consuming and costly to engage people who have low levels of literacy.<\/p> <p>  To give an example, ETBs have memorandums of understanding with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Reference was made to JobPath.  Our experience is that JobPath refers people into the literacy programmes and we would spend a lot of time working with community stakeholders, statutory stakeholders, partnership companies and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  There are myriad ways in which people engage with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cr&oacute;na Gallagher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I want to go back to the first question on costs.

PwC was effectively the first non-education-based entity to apply a methodology to coming up with that figure and, consequently, that has driven huge investment across the Dutch Government and a number of its Departments, so it is not just the Dutch Department of Education, though it is playing the leading role, but a total of four Government Departments combining resources to address the issue in the Netherlands currently.  It is an interesting comparison, considering the economy of the Netherlands in comparison to Ireland, but it is also taking place in a number of other countries as well.  There is a kind of shift in terms of what needs to be done about this issue at a higher level.<\/p> <p>  In terms of numeracy, we have lower levels of awareness that there is something about numeracy impeding one's life, and certainly fewer people enter into services looking for numeracy support.  In the context of what used to be called dyscalculia and was sometimes called dyscalculia, one of the issues is that, in order to get a diagnosis, people need to go to an educational psychologist.  However, even if they get a diagnosis, this does not provide them with any additional supports.  Many children are diagnosed with it.  This does make a difference in terms of how they might learn.  We find many parents are struggling with children who perhaps have that diagnosis but the parents do not necessarily know how to support them, and the children probably have a negative attitude to maths from a very young age, or that is our experience.  We believe there is a usefulness in putting attention on numeracy as a subject in its own right, and perhaps there could be an awareness campaign specifically around this and around helping people to see how relatively important it is in one's life, and also that there are ways to do something about it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the PISA-OECD test and the PIAAC tests, effectively, one is a test done in school when children are 15, so they are in an environment where they are used to sitting tests, whereas the PIAAC is based on taking a series of tests over the course of one hour when the adults involved are not used to being put through that format.  They are effectively tests of real-life examples that would use people's literacy and numeracy skills.  We would contend that despite the PISA scores, however high they might be, the gains are not being held as people become adults, given we now have people who are surveyed in PIAAC who would have been the population that was surveyed in the early stages of PISA.  The OECD and, from what we can work out, all of the other stakeholders cannot explain why we have those two differences.  It is, at least, cause for concern that it would not appear we are holding the gains that we have taken comfort from in the PISA tests in regard to the adult process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Inez Bailey"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>There is obviously an issue with the assessment of PISA in regard to how children are assessed because they are being assessed literally regarding what they are learning or what type of literature they are engaging with, rather than literacy in the broader sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#G00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Not necessarily.  The cultural context is that they are sitting tests all the time, so sitting this test is not something that is abnormal to them in a school environment, whereas if they have to be randomly selected from the population to sit through an hour-long test, that gives us a better indication of whether a 25 year old has a good level of literacy, as opposed to what he or she did when he or she was 15.  They are not the same tests and it is not the same environment, but it is concerning that they are not holding the strong performance.  There is a sense that the PIAAC data showed us as being below the EU and OECD average.  I do not think that is a place we should be happy with, yet the gains over 17 years between the two surveys were very small.<\/p><p>In fact, it was statistically negligible, according to the CSO.  There has been a sense that the PIAAC was not too bad but we would perhaps be putting forward the message that it is very concerning to be that far down by comparison with European countries that did better than us and that are taking this more seriously.  That is the current situation.<\/p><p> The PEC system scoring in the Department of Employment and Social Protection includes people identifying whether they have a literacy or numeracy issue.  There is self-identification.  We are aware that the Department knows how many self-identify as having a literacy or numeracy issue when they are put through the PEC system and end up with a score.  Our agency has certainly supported the Department in examining the number of people who have identified themselves as having a literacy and numeracy issue and in ensuring they are getting support to address it while there are on the Department's books.<\/p><p> With regard to citizen information, we have done quite a bit of work on awareness training of staff to ensure staff in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the citizens information service are aware of how to detect and refer an individual sensitively.  They say they get many people who have difficulty understanding the forms and filling them out.  I will come to that in a second.<\/p><p> On the proportion of 7%, we are not necessarily completely equating people with literacy and numeracy difficulties with people who have low educational attainment but we are aware there is a strong correlation.  We set the target to bring the proportion down to 7% in 2007.  We still have the same target in 2019 and we are not going to reach, which is concerning.  That is not a PIAAC-PISA argument.  It reflects people's educational attainment levels.  There are many in the cohort - almost 500,000 - who do not have upper secondary qualifications and who are in the labour force.  Over the period in question, why have we not closed the gap?  Admittedly, we had a lot more resources in the noughties but it is now 2019 and will not have reached the target by 2020.  It is not 7% to be achieved in 2025; it is 7% to be achieved in 2020, with a new target to be set after that.  Where people have a difficulty, they must be made aware that there is support available.  Where staff are coming across people with difficulties, we are trying to do awareness training with them so they can make referrals.  There is a good relationship and understanding that the ETBs across the country are available to support people.<\/p><p> With regard to language struggle, we live in a very dense information age.  A great volume of information is thrust upon people and they are dependent on their individual skills to analyse it and act on it, not only in terms of their own benefits but also in terms of everything else they might do in their lives.  In this regard, we mentioned the issue of them supporting their children in accessing higher education.  We receive many calls from people having difficulty supporting their children in second level education and accessing supports.  We are very much advocating a plain English Bill.  I believe it is being considered on Second Stage.  Good practice is being volunteered by organisations but it is not consistent practice.  It should be mandatory across public information providers.  That is what we advocate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Inez Bailey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>My colleagues have answered many of the questions raised.  Let me address the point on the 7% target.  Ms Bailey is correct in that it will not be reached.  In quarter 4 last year, the figure was 11.8%.  It was 14.6% in quarter 4 of 2014.  It is, therefore, moving in the right direction but the target will not be reached.<\/p> <p>  The difference between the PIAAC figures and the target figure of the national skills strategy is that the latter relates to formal educational qualifications.  To move towards the 7% target, people need to get qualifications at upper secondary level.  That involves formal, certified provision.  This matter is somewhat distinct from the questions on the adult literacy service.  Many of the qualifications in this regard are certified, but at lower levels.  The education is mostly part-time, which helps a lot in accessibility and availability.  It is delivered across a broad range of providers at community level and by ETBs.  It is very good in terms of ease of access but, to move towards formal educational qualification attainment at upper secondary level, there is a need to move on to different types of programmes.  The question of converting engagement in lower-intensity adult literacy programmes into engagement in formal education is an issue.  That probably speaks to the theme of the level of co-ordination on the ground, as raised by Ms Bailey and committee members.  As Ms Gallagher outlined, there are some good formal link-ups between the Department of Employment and Social Protection, Intreo offices and ETBs through formal memorandums of understanding.<\/p> <p>  There is an improved story since the creation of the ETBs.  Many disparate parts of further and adult education and training were brought together under the roof of a single agency.  We are seeing more of the literacy services supporting learners on other further education and training programmes.  There is a better connection within the ETBs.  There is an improvement in respect of engagement with the Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection but the same formality does not exist in regard to the entire range of other services.  There is probably a way to go in that respect.  The new further education and training strategy will address that link-up.<\/p> <p>  When we hear that 450,000 people have an education at a level lower than lower secondary level, we must remember that, given the unemployment level is thankfully quite low, many of them are in employment.  That is positive in the overall sense but it challenges the model of delivery by ETBs of adult education provision because they are well linked in with community groups and many of the services.

If people are in employment, however, it behoves us to also reach them in the workplace.  Some of this involves working through employers.  The skills to advance initiative does a lot of that.  Let us be clear that some employers are not necessarily enormously committed to the development of the literacy of their workforce if they do not see an immediate payoff in terms of what is happening on the job.

The other factor that has served to reduce the stigma of literacy programmes is the fact that we are doing ICT courses.

For more than 30 years, An Cos&aacute;n has been committed to empowering disadvantaged individuals to achieve their potential in Tallaght west.<\/p><p>Recently we scaled up our impact throughout the country using technology to connect entire communities to learning across Ireland.  As a nation, we hold a top ten position globally in our proportion of STEM graduates from third level.  That is an amazing statistic, but that needs to be set against the fact that only 48% of individuals have at least basic digital skills, which means that 52% do not.  This is one of the lowest levels in the EU.  The EU average is 57%.  We are facing a digital divide of catastrophic proportions.<\/p><p> Globally, entire sectors of employment are threatened by digital innovation.  One third of jobs in Ireland in agriculture, retail, transport, hospitality, manufacturing and low-paid jobs in the public sector are all at high risk of digital disruption.  Today our Government is rapidly accelerating online delivery of public services, yet more than 40% of our citizens are disconnected or digitally disadvantaged.  As ever those with lower levels of education are most impacted.  The World Economic Forum has pointed to the need for retraining existing workforces, a proactive approach to their lifelong learning, and governments rapidly and creatively crafting a supportive environment to assist individual and organisational efforts.<\/p><p> An Cos&aacute;n has been seriously concerned by the digital divide but we knew we could not tackle the issue alone; it required a collaborative approach.  We have developed a very interesting model, which is a tripartite relationship across corporate, community and public sectors.  Through collaboration, we create impact and are best placed to solve complex social questions.  In the past two years, An Cos&aacute;n has joined forces with top global companies, creating a model of partnership to tackle social issues.  We have harnessed our resources and developed a strategic digital pathways framework and programme to significantly improve the digital skills of all our citizens and people in the workplace.  We are discussing with SOLAS how the framework might align with and support further education and training provision.<\/p><p> In our submission, we have made a number of recommendations and I will focus on just two.  We need a whole-society approach to a whole-society problem.  We need to adopt that collaborative, cross-sectoral, integrated and strategic approach to bring all of the resources of the corporate, public and community sectors together to solve the digital divide problems we are facing.<\/p><p> We also recommend having a new Irish digital champion to spearhead a campaign, as we did years ago on literacy, to make people aware that we are facing a tsunami.  Such a digital champion should encourage Irish citizens to check their digital skills to become digitally competent.  Ireland could be an exemplar of how being a digitally competent nation appears.  Alternatively, we could be like the UK where the digital skills gap is going to cost that country &pound;141 billion.  That is not where we want to go, but we need to act quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Waters","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to make a submission on this important topic and for inviting FIT to the meeting.  The presentation we just heard was very impressive.<\/p> <p>  FIT works in close collaboration with SOLAS and ETBs in order that diverse jobseekers can access quality ICT training programmes and more recently apprenticeships.  FIT has also developed digital literacy programmes with the support of the private sector, global foundations, the EU, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and SOLAS, which to date have benefited more than 30,000 people.  These programmes demonstrate a practical low-cost train-the-trainer approach, supporting people with literacy and numeracy gaps, youth at risk, migrants, older people, farmers and those who want access to services, such as online banking.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, we highlighted Irish and EU policies that we believe are important in addressing digital literacy, including: the national digital strategy and its digital skills for citizens scheme, which I hope we will hear more about later; the further education and training, FET, strategy and its goal of active inclusion; the skills to advance and innovation through collaboration schemes from the Department of Education and Skills; and the EU&rsquo;s key competencies for lifelong learning, one of which is digital and technology-based competency. <\/p> <p>  Our work on the ground has made us acutely aware that projects such as digital skills for citizens funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment provided a constant glimmer of hope and connectivity for many communities during the darkest days of the recent recession.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, we reported on Ireland&rsquo;s poor ranking and we have heard much about this.  Ireland is 21st out of 33 countries for digital literacy, based on the OECD&rsquo;s survey of adult skills, the PIAAC.  We believe we can, and should, do much better.  We are running behind neighbours such as the UK.  We are embarrassed about that as a digital leader in our economic performance. <\/p> <p>  There are two key emerging threats that Ireland needs to act on urgently.  First, one in three jobs in Ireland is at high risk due to the impact of digitalisation.  Second, accelerating digitalisation in private and public service delivery has the potential to increase the digital divide.  Instead we need to ensure that digitalisation is an enabler for people, particularly vulnerable workers and older people. <\/p> <p>  FIT has four recommendations that we believe merit the committee's consideration.  The first we call \"digi-community\".  We propose the development of a five-year digital inclusion strategy to invest in the building of social capital in communities, building on the experience of activists such as FIT and others, and the needs articulated by disadvantaged communities, whether they be neighbourhood-based or defined by other factors such as age, education, disability or ethnicity. <\/p> <p>  The second we named \"digi-workforce\".  We propose the establishment of a targeted programme to upskill employees who are vulnerable due to their lack of digital literacy.  Our third recommendation is to embed what we call a \"digihub\" or \"digiclub\" model, as we detailed in our submission, as a strand in the proposed digi-community and digi-workforce actions.  It is not just skills training; it is engagement with and empowerment of the people doing the learning.<\/p> <p>  We believe that a digitally literate workforce and a community go hand-in-hand, and that the monitoring of progress is best judged in the round.  We recommend the creation of a digital skills observatory to track progress across community and the workforce, to benchmark against peer nations and to evolve and appraise stakeholders. <\/p> <p>  I appreciate the opportunity to share our views and make our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Dr. Alice Mathers of Good Things Foundation.

We appreciate being able to speak among these other experts.<\/p> <p>  Digital technology is transforming how we engage with the world around us at work and at home.  As the world increasingly moves online, it is vital to ensure that no one is left behind thereby failing to benefit from the economic and social opportunities that digital can provide.  Good Things Foundation is a social change charity, focused on digital inclusion, that works in the UK and Australia to help people lead better lives through digital.  Our work has provided us with a good understanding of the importance of digital literacy in these contexts and the scale of the digital divide.<\/p> <p>  In the UK, 4.1 million adults have never used the Internet.<\/p><p>A further 7.8 million lack the essential digital skills needed for day-to-day life and 53% of the working population do not have the digital skills needed for work.  It is estimated that 2.5 million adults are offline in Australia, with a further 4 million classed as limited users.  An estimated 4 million Australians use their mobile phones to get online and have no fixed connection.  Those with limited skills are more likely to live in rural areas while those online are more likely to be younger, wealthier and more educated.  Those with disabilities are less likely to benefit from the digital age.  Having a low income, low literacy and numeracy skills and low self-confidence are all compounding factors that can intensify digital exclusion.  Key motivational barriers can also prevent people from engaging with digital, particularly those who think digital is not for them, who feel they lack support or who perceive it as too complicated or too expensive. <br\/><br\/>At Good Things Foundation, we believe that community organisations are best placed to deliver basic digital skills support to those most vulnerable to being excluded from the benefits of the digital age.  We have developed a highly effective, mission-led, scaled operational model that works collaboratively with thousands of local community organisations to deliver digital<b><\/b>learning.  This is teamed with a blended model of online learning content and offline support.  In the UK, Good Things Foundation co-ordinates the Online Centres Network comprising more than 5,000 hyper-local grassroots organisations including community centres, small charities, work clubs, health centres, advice centres, libraries and even a fish and chip shop.  All are independent of us and all are based in the heart of their communities. <br\/><br\/>Good Things Foundation Australia was established in 2017, having won an Australian Federal Government contract to create a digital inclusion network based on our learnings from the UK.  In under two years, we were able to recruit a local network of more than 2,700 organisations.  Such investment in digital skills support benefits not only individuals, but communities and society.  It increases people's earning potential and their likelihood of finding employment, promotes financial inclusion and decreases loneliness and social isolation, as well as providing time and cost savings for both individuals and government services.  As such, we believe that digital technology can be an enabler, can help us to solve some of our greatest social challenges and can change lives.  We encourage the Irish Parliament to adopt a nationally co-ordinated, community-centred approach to increasing adult digital literacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alice Mathers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mathers and invite Mr. Bryant to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#L00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to contribute on the important issue of digital literacy among adults.  In my opening statement, I hope to highlight some of the main aspects of my written submission.  Ireland is a highly-skilled, knowledge economy with a particularly high rate of ICT graduates.  This is a direct result of an historically strong education system and the presence of many large multinational corporations that require such a labour force.  By EU standards, according to the digital economy and society index, DESI, report, Ireland also benefits from an above-average level of broadband coverage and of female ICT specialists as a percentage of female employment.  While these results all suggest a strong position for the country, a number of underlying problems may negatively impact Ireland if left unaddressed.  For instance, while broadband coverage may be good, the price of broadband is a limiting factor in the take-up of such services.  Additionally, as mentioned by previous speakers, approximately 50% of individuals lack least basic digital skills, with a similar number lacking at least basic software skills.<\/p> <p>  The differences between those who are highly technologically literate and those without basic digital skills are the foundation for the inequality known as the digital divide.  The digital divide describes the sometimes severe cost a citizen can incur, economically or socially, by being unable to participate in a network society such as Ireland&rsquo;s.  This ranges from being unable to easily access government services to being significantly less employable and finding it difficult to upskill at the required rate.  As the public and private sectors both further digitise, the exclusionary effect on those without basic digital literacy grows faster.  New challenges such as job automation, artificial intelligence and algorithmic bias are becoming significant parts of our dialogue as an economy and society and this dialogue benefits from having a diverse, skilled citizenry participating in it.<\/p> <p>  In my written submission, I outline some of the main barriers to access for adults lacking digital skills, including having the ability, means, skills or motivation to engage with digital systems.  However, gaps in digital literacy and the aforementioned barriers often have their foundations in societal inequalities and that these need to be addressed as part of any comprehensive solution.  I make several suggestions for policymakers, which I am happy to discuss in more detail.  These range from conditional subsidies or stimulation for lagging groups to encouraging open access for information.  Overall, I believe Ireland is in a good position to try to close the gap in the digital divide, though this will depend heavily on sustained political will and private sector buy-in on a range of solutions, as detailed in submissions to this committee.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee again for the invitation to make both written and oral submissions and I look forward to answering any questions on the topic where I can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Bryant"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bryant and invite Mr. Marshall from Microsoft to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#L00400","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to make an opening statement to the committee.  We have made a written submission in response to the questions we were asked to address so I will simply go through the main points.<\/p> <p>  It is now commonplace to say that we live in a time of unprecedented technological change.  The pace of advancement is greater than any time in human history.  However, there are lessons from history that we can learn when thinking about how we develop an integrated strategy to move forward to develop skills across the board for all out citizens.  This is not something new.  The notion of technological unemployment was highlighted by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s.  He wrote about examples from the past of workers being displaced by new technologies such as water wheels, windmills, mechanical clocks, steam engines and so on.  <\/p> <p>  There is now a growing movement within the technology area that is interested in the notion of artificial intelligence and how it is going to impact our lives now and into the future.  A recent study by McKinsey highlighted the fact that between 40% and 50% of the workforce is currently affected by artificial intelligence and that this will increase over the next five years.  More worryingly, it has been suggested that as many as 800 million workers could be displaced by artificial intelligence by 2030.  This is hugely significant in the context of policies on the education of all of our citizens.  A number of frameworks exist, which are worth highlighting, particularly the work done by the European Commission on DigiComp 2.1, which outlines a number of skills, strategies and competencies that are worth considering in the context of policy going forward.  Reference is made to information and data literacy, communication, collaboration and safety.  <\/p> <p>  I was struck by what was said by previous contributors on the challenges in basic literacy, of which I was unaware, to be honest.  That creates an even greater challenge for us because to access all this fantastic technology and the courses that are available, people need to be able to engage with the material.  In that context, there is an even greater need for an integrated strategy.  <\/p> <p>  Over the past couple of months, we have been working with An Cos&aacute;n to develop the digital stepping stones programme, an interesting and enlightening project.  We will continue to work with An Cos&aacute;n to improve outcomes by providing infrastructure and a curriculum that we feel is relevant to upskilling individuals across the country.  We have provided more details on this in our written submission and I am happy to engage with the committee to discuss these issues further.  <\/p> <p>  The final point I would make is that we need to pay attention to this and to develop an integrated policy and an implementation strategy that deals with all of these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Marshall"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Marshall.

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Caroline Henry, who leads on the digital skills for citizens scheme.<\/p> <p>  A number of Departments are active in the area of digital literacy, including the Departments of Education and Skills and Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which focus on formal education, labour force participation and future skills.<\/p><p>The focus of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in this area is on introducing non-onliners, those who have never used the Internet before, to use Internet and digital technologies.  The objective is to provide these non-onliners opportunity to gain the basic skills and confidence to start their digital journey by removing some of the barriers, for example, fear and a lack of skills, trust and awareness of what being online can offer.  Such benefits can include saving time and money, staying in touch with family and friends, enjoying a wider variety of hobbies and interests, staying up-to-date with news, accessing Government services and obviously being able to participate in education.<\/p><p> Since 2008, the Department has run two schemes designed to help those who have never used the Internet before.  The first was the benefit scheme, which ran from 2008 to 2016, investing &euro;8.4 million in providing basic training to 157,000 participants.  This was replaced in 2017 by the digital skills for citizens scheme.  The scheme provides free, informal, basic digital skills training, where people attending classes will learn the skills they need to take their first steps to getting online.  Since training commenced in 2017, &euro;4.8 million has been invested in providing basic digital skills to over 51,000 participants.  The Department recognises that voluntary community and not-for-profit organisations are very well-placed to identify and encourage people within their communities who have not yet engaged with the Internet.  In 2017, the Department entered into grant agreements with 15 voluntary community and not-for-profit organisations, including FIT, which is here today, to deliver such informal training on basic digital skills.  Training classes are available for anyone who does not have the confidence, motivation or skills to reap the benefits of digital technologies.  Training is targeted at people over 45 years of age, members of the farming communities, small business owners, the unemployed, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged groups, but in reality, anyone who has not interacted with Internet technologies can go on the course.  Classes take place in libraries, schools, community centres, marts and GAA clubs across all counties.  They are advertised locally on the Department's website, with times, venues and content arranged to meet the needs of the participants.  Each participant receives ten hours of training in a class of no more than ten people.  An Internet-enabled device, a computer, laptop or tablet, is provided for use during the class, or if people wish they can bring their own devices.  The class content is made up of six hours of compulsory modules, which include things like accessing emails, using search engines, accessing online government services, using apps, and then there are a further four hours of training that are tailored to meet the specific needs of the participants.  <\/p><p> The Department also works closely with other Government Departments to provide relevant content for the online Government services aspect of the training.  For example, our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provided tutors with demonstration herd numbers for use on its ag food site.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has provided an interactive demonstration of their motor tax renewal application, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has focused on the use of the Eircode finder.  At the end of each training course, participants are asked to provide feedback by completing an online survey.  Almost 20,000 people over the age of 65 have attended the classes, and some 6,500 from the farming community have also benefited from the training.<\/p><p> In addition to the work of the grantees, like FIT, in promoting awareness of the scheme and encouraging people to participate, the Department has promoted the scheme at the National Ploughing Championships and by distributing material through public participation networks, Citizens Information offices and the local authority broadband officer network.  Training under the current scheme will continue until 2020.  The Department is now looking at how best to move forward with the scheme in the context of the new national digital strategy being developed by the Department of the Taoiseach in partnership with stakeholder Departments and agencies.  It is clear that much work remains to be done in this area, with a particular focus on scale, effectiveness and co-ordination of efforts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bill Morrissey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Morrissey very much.

We have heard lots of good things about her.  That is why reached out, so we were delighted she could be here.  I have been involved with lots of different digital organisations, charities and activists in the last few years since I have been a public representative.  Part of me gets a bit frustrated, because I feel like we are repeating that cycle that we had with literacy many years ago, where we are just scraping off the people who we can motivate and engage with.  I mention the issues of isolation and loneliness and people being able to engage with their doctors or with social welfare.  Again, we are reaching people just to get them through the day.  In the past year, I have become more aware that when it comes to digital literacy, the problem is going to be much bigger than it was in terms of literacy and being able to engage with democracy and the threat to democracy.  Who actually builds the systems we are working within?  When I think of that 52% of people, who do not have basic literacy skills, I wonder who they are.  When we are collating that data, is there a demographic identifier of who makes up that 52%?<\/p> <p>  It feeds into what Mr. Bryant said earlier about a particularly high rate of ICT graduates.  Again, who are those ICT graduates?  We have to look at how that divide is set up.  Sometimes, a number can look good, but actually it is just a really stark, gaping hole between the two different kinds of people that fit into either of those camps.  I am wondering what we can do to impact the different levels of digital literacy so people can use it not only to engage in life, but to disseminate information that they are reading online and be able to know what is and is not a real article and whether it is peer-reviewed.  What are we teaching people at that basic level?<\/p> <p>  Maybe Mr. Bryant can go a bit further into how AI and job automation are going to affect those with basic literacy skills.  I know we have discussed this before, but I became really alarmed when I started reading some of the stuff that Mr. Bryant gave me about how algorithms are being built in the US that have that class, racial or gender bias and are even being used within the prison system to detect whether somebody will commit a crime in the future, a crime that has not even been committed.  This all ties into who those ICT graduates are in the first place, and how  we can change so people are not being let down by their digital literacy skills and by society or life generally but can instead engage in education and democracy without being discriminated against by algorithms.  <\/p> <p>  I am wondering about fake news and democracy, and maybe Mr. Marshall can answer this question for me.  Are people with low levels of literacy or digital literacy most susceptible to fake news and the threat to democracy, elections, health information and everything that comes with that?  We have seen online all these dubious links between certain injections.  Who is going to be most impacted by this type information, and how can we improve digital literacy to ensure that people can engage in a real way with that type of material?<\/p> <p>  What does a whole of Irish society approach look like?  I know Ms Waters was speaking of the approach that was taken in relation to the Good Things Foundation, and maybe she could talk a little about what that actually looks like in an Irish context.

I wanted to focus on a number of them.  Who is most vulnerable and therefore what really works for them?  What we have found through our work is that within communities where one does not have a lot of external influence, there has been an ever-decreasing amount of public and community support and a lack of employment opportunities.<\/p><p>There is a cycle of peer influence that goes on.  I referred to the point of people deciding this is not for them because there is a real problem with younger people who come up through those communities and do not see people using digital technologies in a broad way to affect different areas of their lives.  Through our work, one of the things we increasingly see is this idea of people who only use social media.  People who have a smartphone will use a small amount of the apps that are already installed on the phone and they do not have the literacy or media literacy skills to do much more beyond that.  Therefore, one of the most effective measures with that issue is peer influence.  Working with community leaders and organisations that people trust is really critical in communities where people feel they have had a raw deal for a long time.  The idea of external influences coming in and telling people what to do and how to do it is not an effective model.  Online centres in the UK as a model always come out of a community need first and foremost, be that a lack of employment, poor mental health or the focus on loneliness and isolation and it is because digital technologies can be a solution to all those things that we see community organisations as being one of the most powerful routes to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alice Mathers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>As Ms Waters is in a community organisation maybe she will come in next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#N00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>What Dr. Mathers said is the truth.  One of the things we would be aware of is to ask the question about who in Ireland is affected by the digital divide today.  We work in disadvantaged communities right across the country and they are the same people we work with in west Tallaght.  They are struggling with poverty and social exclusion every day.  Their lives are somewhat depressed and chaotic and they struggle.  They are full of fear with no self-confidence or self-belief.  There is a lack of motivation.  We know community organisations on the ground know how to take that on as an issue and change it.  We can encourage people in and they will cross over the door.  It takes courage to come in but we know our learners and we can work with them to build their confidence and skills.  Some 48% of people in west Tallaght do not have access to a computer.  They do not have one and they only have access to one when they come into us.  Virtually every single one of them has a smartphone, however.  Do they utilise it?  No, they do not utilise it in any way close to the extent to which it could be used to support them.  Can we build their digital skills?  That is where we start.<\/p> <p>  With Accenture, we have built a most amazing assessment tool that Accenture has poured hundreds of thousands of euro into developing with us.  That assessment tool is accessible and easy-to-use and we can encourage our learners to use it and to assess themselves.  If we are talking about the skills gap, one of the things we need to be scared witless about is the lack of knowledge and understanding, particularly about safety and about people's digital footprint and digital identity.  Many of the learners we work with do not have a clue about that.  That is a key place to start.  They can go on this assessment tool and when they get back their results they can be pointed in the direction of a range of resources that can either be used in a community, in a learning hub or on their own.  They can be pointed towards how to engage and how to build their skills.<\/p> <p>  It is the same as the work we have been doing with literacy for years.  If we remember how bad things were 20 to 30 years ago when NALA started, that is where we are today.  We are excluding half of our adult population from actively participating in this new world.  Basic digital skills are the first step.  Then we need a progression pathway.  That involves our work with Microsoft to see how we can build that pathway so there is a clear progression pathway.  How would Future Now Digital's initiative that was referred to look like in Ireland?  It would look like having a tripartite strong national relationship with the public sector, the corporate sector and the community sector with all the knowledge, skills and resources they are willing to employ to solve complex social problems.  An Cos&aacute;n is happy to support that process, as the Good Things Foundation has done, but it is key that we look to a way of having an integrated national solution to this national problem.  We can do it.

On the notion of fake news, none of us is immune to that and to being susceptible to what is out there, particularly as the world has changed so quickly and the information is coming at us so quickly.  The more educated and well read one is at least reduces the opportunity to be taken in by fake news.  Some of the bigger skills outside of regular curriculum we need to think about include this notion of problem solving and computational thinking, which is beginning to gain a bit of credence within our system.  We have an incubation lab in Microsoft in Sandyford called the dream space.  It has been open for about 18 months and to date we have had 20,000 students, both primary and secondary, come through the door.  It is a three to three and a half hour engagement and the curriculum is tailored to the particular age group but we all talk about AI and the challenges therein, the good stuff associated with it and the notion of facial recognition and what that is and what it is not.  Our ten year-olds are acutely aware of what those technologies are, more so than we are.  Those types of ideas can be imparted to the likes of working with An Cos&aacute;n and other organisations such as that.  It is about education and we have to keep at it.  We have to be more targeted and streamlined and we have to be a bit more fearful.  These numbers are challenging, including the literacy numbers.

It is not just training and skills.  It is an understanding of the effect this digitalisation is having and will increasingly have on people's lives, whether one is a person in a low income community who is struggling day-to-day or whether one is a worker who will be forgotten and will be out of work.  We are advocates and activists for the development of communities and we view our digital inclusion and literacy activities in that context.  They do not sit outside of people and the communities.  In the last number of years of the recession, the climate for investment in communities changed.  We witnessed a steep reduction in funding for community-based initiatives and worsening disadvantage and social problems.  In this age, some parts of our society are becoming richer very quickly.<\/p><p>However, there is another part of society which has actually gone backwards in the past number of years.  As others have said, this needs to be an integrated approach.  It needs a timescale - a five-year strategy that can identify how to overcome these issues.  It is important that people get an opportunity to learn as well in a peer-to-peer environment or an intergenerational environment.  The latter environment works well.  It has a similar attraction to people.  I refer to where people not only can understand the skills but can debate among themselves what are they missing out on, what is the issue for them, where are they losing out and where can they benefit.  They do that as peers and are supported in the context of a national integrated approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. George Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I will go to Mr. Bryant on the question he was asked and then come to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#O00200","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I might break up the two main questions on how automation and artificial intelligence, AI, will affect jobs and algorithmic bias.  I will look first at how AI will affect jobs.  I use AI loosely because it has come to mean many different things, both to the technology sector and to the public.  Many view automation in general like the invention of the railroad or the written language in that there was much fear around those inventions at the time.  The agricultural sector was afraid that passing trains would cause cattle to stop breeding, something we, as we look back, think is quite silly.  We will look back in many years' time and think many of our fears about automation were quite silly.  However, it is not correct to compare it to such modest inventions.  Rather, we should view it more as a cultural changing point.  The move is more similar to that from the agricultural economy to the industrial economy.  As Mr. Marshall stated earlier, there are great lessons to be taken from history.  If we look back at that transformation, we see developments such as 12 years of formal education were necessary to bring someone from a farming background up to what was then considered the base-level minimum required education to be able to jump between jobs.  Similarly, with such a high level of digitisation, one must look at a similar transformation in education, or even what we consider education, and the topics of lifelong learning in order to have people who are able to dynamically move between jobs, sectors and roles.  The idea of digital literacy is not something we can confine to a single department or a single executive in a company.  It is the responsibility of all citizens to be digitally literate, which is why it is so important that we are having this discussion today.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the highest-paid jobs, they usually require tertiary level degrees such as a masters of education or a PhD.  The required level has been increasing over the past decades, as one would expect.  Similarly, the entry-level requirements of education are also increasing.  This is also set to increase over the coming decades.  In the case of those who are most at risk of having their jobs automated, as mentioned by previous speakers, those working in agriculture, transport and factories, there is a real question as to how we as a society react to and pre-empt the massive automation that is predicted to be coming down the line within the next few decades.  The primary solutions are to not only take the infrastructural approach of throwing ICT computers, laptops and facilities at people and saying, \"Go and learn\", but to take a more comprehensive look and to state that here are the skills and teachers one needs, the community centres necessary for it and the address of foundational inequalities in society that are causing this.  As previous speakers mentioned, the community approach can often work quite well because one learns with one's peers and one is not expected to go on one's own and venture into uncharted territory when it comes to digital skills.<\/p> <p>  Second, I will touch on the topic of algorithmic bias that has been raised.  There are many examples of this.  It could be as simple as being on social media, seeing many articles and news sources that have similar opinions to oneself, and thinking one's opinions are mainstream opinions and they are reinforced.  There are issues with this that large companies, such as Google and Microsoft, have tackled.  If we look at another system, such as policing technologies, there are examples of policing technologies, the use of which is reasonably widespread in the United States, which direct police forces on where best to use their limited resources but this can be a self-fulfilling prophecy in that the most traditionally under-serviced regions experience slightly higher crime.  This means that these regions are more likely to be policed and more people are more likely to be charged with crimes in these regions.  Similarly, when one goes back and looks at the data set, it looks as though this model was correct and that one should police these regions even more.  One can see how that would negatively affect different communities.  Such algorithms are not always comprehensive and they will not necessarily look at aspects such as financial crime.  They might be focused on violent crime.  That is merely one example.  When one looks at the idea of digital literacy, as the Senator mentioned, it is also important that policymakers, judges and administrators have these skills and understand not only the possibilities and the use cases but the limitations of such technology.  They should be able to say that maybe this is not the place for statistical analysis and that it is important to have a human in the loop making final decisions in these cases.<\/p> <p>  Finally, this brings me back to the idea that one should not only educate those who are easy to educate.  It is easy to say, if one looks at ICT graduates, that most of them are men with an interest in the sector from middle-class and more affluent backgrounds.  While it is fantastic that we have such a high rate of ICT graduates, it should also be a real point of worry that 50% of citizens do not have basic digital literacy skills.  It is a large divide.  Working on ways to attract that 50%, not necessarily to specialist-level literacy but at least basic digital literacy, is of vital importance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Bryant"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bryant.

An immediate concern is looking to the figures, with only 48% having those basic digital literacy skills.<\/p><p>As I understand that 57% is the average across European countries, we are extraordinarily far beneath the European average.  Looking at this, I think as well about the acceleration of initiatives such as MyGovID.  Soon that is predominantly how we will access childcare; increasingly, it may become how we access medical appointments; it may become how we access driver licences and so on.  What are the witnesses' concerns about our not bridging the gap?  There is also the fact that the pace of a digital requirement from citizens is moving far faster, it seems, than the pace of skilling up citizens, giving them digital skills and empowering them.  Are the witnesses concerned about the deepening of certain of the social, economic and other disadvantages we have across vital areas such as health, education and childcare?  Are we in danger in the short term of a period of in fact exacerbating or accelerating disadvantage?  What should be done about that?  Do we need to provide non-digital alternatives alongside MyGovID during the bridging period for skills?  That is a short-term question, and I ask it in the context of my membership of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We have seen that accelerating of digital requirements.<\/p><p> We are policymakers, and policy consists always of decisions as to how we live together and the spaces we share.  The online space is clearly a space we now share.  Big debates are happening at the macro level which relate to exactly the work the witnesses talked about.  The online space is not simply something that is happening; it is being created and driven.  There is, for example, the general data protection regulation at a European level, with the idea that people's data and information belong to them.  The web accessibility directive came in in September.  This is the idea that websites should be usable by people, including those with a disability, at a basic level.  There are these positive drivers and elements, which should be empowering.  It is a matter of that route from digital literacy to digital empowerment.  It is almost that we have this huge gap to bridge but we have quite far to go.  I ask the witnesses to comment on how we go from digital literacy to digital empowerment.  I ask this because we need people; it is not simply that people need these skills for employment.  I was very interested to hear the witnesses' comments on employment.  Again, I sit on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and through the Chair I might find an opportunity to bring a complementary discussion to that committee on employment and the future of work.  We need our social processes, decisions, policies and so on to reflect the diversity of society.  We as policymakers need people to be digitally empowered.<\/p><p> The witnesses might build further on the question of the algorithmic bias.  How do we ensure transparency for people in respect of how they are being algorithmically targeted?  How do we ensure the push on diversity within that?  There are also a few really practical things.  One thing I would like the witnesses to comment on is community development.  I was pleased to hear that much of it seems to be grants-driven.  That is important and appropriate in order that we are not simply giving people a particular digital skill for a particular digital job which may exist now but might not exist or be relevant in six months' time but that we are giving people those slightly deeper needs-based skills.  I think Dr. Mathers identified that people need to identify their needs, hopes and ambitions for the online space.  How do we then make sure their needs drive it and that we have enough flexibility in the funding that is going to the grass roots?  Perhaps the witnesses could talk about that.  It is not just a matter of reaching out to tell everybody about a course they can do in order that they can get a job; it is a case of listening upwards a little more.  I ask witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p> I can see that there is some funding.  It clearly needs to be scaled up immensely in the short term, given that Ireland is 10% behind the rest of Europe.  One area I have identified, and it is an issue I have highlighted before in a couple of other fora and which complements the GDPR, is that we are now facing a period when Ireland will in fact, through our data protection law, be issuing some of the largest fines under data protection legislation and the GDPR.  I suggest that a portion of that funding be ring-fenced for digital empowerment.  That would be a way of including, as I said, a positive circular dynamic in order that it is not simply a matter of grants from companies and so forth but a matter of the fines going back into skilling people up to be more aware.  Ms Waters mentioned the issue of people's own digital safety and digital empowerment, that they are able to mind their data and that we could remove a lot of the fear of engaging.  This is a comment for Mr. Morrissey.  When we talk about fear, there is fear that is justified and then fear that needs to be overcome.  People can be apprehensive about their own skills and we must give them the encouragement to overcome that.  Then there is also the matter of people being given the confidence and skills to be able to mind their own safety.  When we go to the United States we see people taking out insurance against identity theft.  People are just in a state of fear there and literally take out insurance in case their identify is stolen because they do not have the relevant skills.  In Europe we have tools that people can use to guard and protect their digital footprint and their digital safety online.  People feel able to use those and make them meaningful for themselves.<\/p><p> Those are just some of the areas I would love the witnesses to comment on.  This is a hugely important area for all of us.  We will come back to it, as I said.  I might try to have a complementary discussion on employment, which I have not focused on.  We have a committee on employment and I would love this to be a part of the debate on the future of work because it intersects with the four-day week and all those ideas of rethinking work in a positive way.  I have talked enough so I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#O00900","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has dealt a lot with digital safety issues for young people as well, so the issue crosses a number of committees.

That has always been our philosophy because the moment we get tied into focusing on a framework for measurements and success which is driven by the number of people who have the requisite-seeming skills for work at that point, we are already out of date.  The other big thing about that is that it does nothing really to demonstrate what we all need, which is a lasting behavioural change to using digital positively in work and in life.  Our model and the model of all the community organisations with which we work have been about that lasting behavioural change.  It is a question of how one overcomes previous negative experiences, the feeling that one is being \"done to\", that digital is something one must accept.  Increasingly, that is the story we hear time and time again from heavy users of a range of government services: \"This is being done to me, and I am being sanctioned as a result.\"  It is a matter of overcoming those engagements and solving the immediate crisis in order that people have the space to engage with digital differently.  A lot of this, as a number of other speakers have mentioned, comes through peer-to-peer support and people who have been on a similar journey.  We work a lot with digital champions, who are people who have come through that journey in their communities and can say that digital is about achieving one's personal goals in life, that it will change and particularly that it is critical that one is adaptable.  Digital is not about using one programme or piece of software to do one task because that immediately places people in a point of vulnerability.  It is about thinking of digital as helping people solve problems or achieve goals and that therefore digital is an ally.  Teaching people how to have that mindset is as critical as teaching them the technical skills themselves.  That is what community organisations are brilliant at doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alice Mathers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":195,"content":"<p>May I just build on that?

Generally, digitisation of services that a wide number of people can make use of is a really great opportunity.  It can be very cost effective and it can speed up traditionally quite slow bureaucratic services.  The two greatest problems we see in other nations' examples are that often there is a motivation, a skills or a usage access barrier.  On one hand, one has elements of the labour force who say they have always done it a certain way and who ask why there is a need to improve it, so one really has to prove to people and bring them on the journey of implementing digitisation.  That is not just citizens but it is also members of the labour force implementing the systems.<\/p> <p>  On the usage filter, which is an access issue, it is a bit more obvious but the idea is that the people using and administering the system have to be skilled up and it is not a one-off piece of expenditure.  It is a continuous process like upskilling in any other area.  It takes a continued investment of both time and resources.<\/p> <p>  On the second point on how one equitably produces members of society that can contribute in both the algorithms themselves or other elements of digital society, it comes back to that main point of how the more people who are included within and who enjoy the benefits of a network, the more the costs of exclusion will grow, so that any system that is rolled out has to be done across all elements of society.  As I said, it is not enough to educate the easy-to-educate in this area.  It has to be done equitably.<\/p> <p>  A great example is the roll-out of computer science in the secondary school curriculum.  We saw it rolled out to 40 schools, nine of which were DEIS schools, which is about a representative proportion.  I would be very interested to see, as this increases and is rolled out on a wider basis and similar schemes are done, whether a same proportion is represented, because minimising costs should not necessarily be the priority.  The priority should be helping citizens to upskill and become digitally literate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2019111900002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Bryant"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Bryant.

We stopped to review what was happening after training 157,000 people.  We looked at how technology was changing and we looked to the community groups and the tutors at the time for feedback.  Smartphones were the issue, as I think Ms Waters mentioned.  A lot of people have technology in their pockets.  They might not necessarily have a connection at home, but they have the facility and the wherewithal to do it.  They just do not know how to use it.  Part of the remit in doing the programme was to look at what citizens needed and what was going to make a difference to their daily lives.  It was not about certification and it was not about getting them back in the workforce.  It was about making a difference to their daily lives such as how they could save money and how they could engage with family.  A lot of families had emigrated, particularly during the recession, and a lot of families had moved away.  People needed to be able to stay in touch with them.<\/p> <p>  First, we looked at addressing the fear factor and not just at the anxiety.  We looked at fear of being scammed online.  We hear so much bad publicity about the dangers of being online that we do not necessarily hear the good news and what the benefits can be.  That was part of the story that was missing.  Certainly from my experience and having dealt with the programme for the last three years, some of the good news stories are fantastic.  One does not hear them, but they make a huge difference to people's lives and it is something that we are conscious of and take on board, particularly with what Ms Waters said in relation to working with communities and the hard-to-reach people.<\/p> <p>  Also in devising the programme, we took on board what was said about the need people have.  While the programme looks to address the fear and give people the basic skill, we also look to give the four hours of training to meet their needs, what it is they are interested in and what is going to make a difference to them.  Part of the programme can be tailored to the farming community, and that is where the ten hours is based towards the farming package and what they can do online.  That is what is going to interest them.<\/p> <p>  There are other community groups and maybe book clubs which want to know how to download books, how to read online and stuff like that.  It is tailored to meet the needs of the citizens, and certainly in my experience some of the stories have been fantastic and it is making a difference but it is not enough.  On its own it is not going to work.

I note that the committee is particularly interested in complaints relating to tracker mortgage interest rates but I also note its interest in the practice of dual pricing.<br\/><br\/>The Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO, was established on 1 January 2018.  The establishment of the office involved the merger of the former offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman.  We provide a free service for consumers to resolve complaints about the actions of their pension provider or financial service provider.  Our goal is to redress the balance of power between the individual consumer and provider and we do this by making our service as informal and accessible as possible.  We mediate between the parties and, where necessary, we investigate and issue legally binding decisions.<br\/><br\/>Mediation through telephone, email and meetings is the first and preferred option for resolving complaints.  By engaging with the parties directly, we try to achieve a timely and satisfactory resolution.  Where these early interventions do not resolve the dispute, we use our extensive powers to investigate and adjudicate complaints in a fair and impartial manner.  Full details of how we managed complaints in 2018 are set out in the overview of complaints 2018 that is available on our website.<br\/><br\/>We are dealing with a large volume of complaints which has led us to a situation where we are not dealing with complaints as quickly as we would like to.  In order to deliver the objectives in our strategic plan, we submitted a workforce plan to the Minister for Finance and I am pleased to have received approval to recruit an additional 35 staff.  We have been proactively recruiting to fill these posts.  However, similar to many public sector bodies, the current buoyant job market is making it difficult for us to retain staff.  Our staff resources are still not at the level we would like but we will have more people joining us before the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious that there has been considerable interest in the time limits for making complaints to my office and, in particular, that this has had and impact on our ability to deal with certain tracker mortgage related complaints.  Therefore, I would like to address this issue.  In July 2017, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Act 2017 was enacted.  This legislation changed the period within which complaints could be made to the then Financial Services Ombudsman.  These changes were carried forward into the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017<i>.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The legislation setting out the jurisdiction of this office in respect of time limits for bringing complaints against financial service providers is complex as a result of the various changes that have been made.  Before the formal investigation of each individual complaint can commence, my office must assess whether the complaint has been made within the time limits set out in section 51 the 2017 Act.  A complaint that relates to a long-term financial service must be made within one of the time limits set out in section 51.  I have set those time limits out in a document I have submitted to the committee and will not go through them now.  This can be a lengthy process because, in many instances, an objective consideration must be given to the complainant's date of knowledge and this may require scrutiny of all relevant historical communications.  Both parties are given the opportunity to make all evidence available to that end and all such evidence is shared between the parties so that any jurisdictional determination is conducted in a way that is transparent and fair to both parties.<\/p><p>We also take into account section 54, which suspends those time limits for the period during which a complaint is being dealt with under the provider&rsquo;s internal dispute resolution procedure.  <\/p><p> In the exercise of my discretion, I must point out that not only must reasonable grounds exist, that is, there must be a particular reason to extend the time limit but, in addition, it must be just and equitable, in all of the circumstances, to both parties to do so.  This provision cannot be exercised simply because, for example, the complaint relates to the application of a tracker mortgage.  <\/p><p> The wording in the legislation means it is not possible for a party to the complaint or, indeed, the Ombudsman to simply \"waive\" the time limits.  The use of the word \"shall\" in this provision mandates me to make a determination that a complaint is inadmissible where it was made after the expiry of the legislative time limits.  Some providers had taken an approach in to tracker mortgage-related complaints that the complaint was made within the time limits.  In such circumstances, a full formal assessment of whether the complaint was made within the time limits may not be necessary and the complaint can proceed to investigation.  <\/p><p> In advance of or during a full assessment of the time limits, it is open to a provider to express a view that the complaint was made within the time limits.  This is then taken into account in making a determination on the application of the time limits.  However, where a provider puts forward a view that the complaint was made to this office outside the time limits, and the assessment and evidence supports this view, I must, in accordance with the legislation, determine that the complaint is inadmissible for investigation by this office. <\/p><p> Since the change in time limits, my office has been required to spend considerable time carrying out jurisdictional assessments on a large number of files, including on tracker mortgage-related complaints.  In recent months, however, this is no longer the case for these complaints.  This is because all of main lenders are now taking the approach in the vast majority of tracker mortgage-related complaints, that the complaint was made within the time limits, thus eliminating the need, in those instances, for a full assessment as to whether the complaint was made within the time limits to be conducted. <\/p><p> It has always been my view that the most effective and efficient way to provide redress and compensation to borrowers who were wrongly denied tracker mortgages was for the banks to co-operate fully with the Central Bank tracker examination project.  It is for this reason that we have co-operated significantly with the Central Bank in that process.  After that, when the individual banks completed the tracker mortgage examination, we were then able to proceed with the complaints we had on hold during that process.<\/p><p> Where complainants inform us that they have agreed a settlement with their financial service provider, we close the file.  Where complainants have not been offered redress or compensation by their lender or where complainants are not satisfied with an offer of redress or compensation from their financial service provider, or do not receive an offer from their financial service provider, the mediation, investigation and adjudication processes of this office are, in most cases, available to them.  <\/p><p> We registered 347 new tracker mortgage-related complaints between January and October 2019 and closed 455.  Of the 455 complaints closed, we resolved 234 complaints through our informal mediation process, 146 were closed during the investigation, adjudication and legal services process, we closed 43 complaints at registration and assessment stage, while 24 were deemed withdrawn and eight were noted to be outside the jurisdiction of the office because of the time limits.  I will be happy to provide further details on each of these processes and categories should the members wish me to do so.  <\/p><p> I recently issued 15 legally binding decisions on tracker mortgage complaints.  Two of these were upheld, two were substantially upheld, three were partially upheld and eight were not upheld.  I have also issued six preliminary decisions.  Now that the time limit issue has largely been resolved for tracker mortgage complaints, I expect we will progress the vast majority of complaints.  We hope to continue to resolve the majority of complaints through mediation.  However, I also expect to issue a considerable number of legally binding decisions in the coming months.  I will publish all the decisions issued in 2019, including the tracker mortgage-related decisions, no later than January 2020.  I will also publish a digest of these decisions similar to the digest of 2018 decisions that I published which includes a short summary of selected decisions.   <\/p><p> I very much welcome the power to publish my decisions provided by the Oireachtas in our governing legislation.  Publishing these decisions not only enhances the transparency and understanding of the powers of the office and of the service we provide, but it also plays an important role in providing enhanced protection for consumers.  These decisions will be of assistance to consumers and their advocates and to financial service providers, in both avoiding and resolving disputes.  I am confident that the publication of these decisions in our online database of decisions will help to improve the quality of services and protections available to consumers.  <\/p><p> The committee has indicated that it wishes to discuss the issue known as dual pricing in the insurance industry with us.  My understanding of dual pricing is that it involves a practice whereby some insurers profile their customers to identify price sensitive customers who may shop around for the best price and move.  Such customers may then be quoted a lower renewal fee, or a discount, compared to loyal customers who are profiled as being less price sensitive as they do not shop around and are, therefore, quoted a higher rate or not offered a discount.  Insurers, like all financial service providers, have a responsibility to treat their customers fairly.  Fairness is at the heart of what we do as FSPO.  Being fair means not improperly discriminating against a person or a body.  The Oireachtas has specifically provided that I can uphold a complaint against a financial service provider where I believe the provider&rsquo;s conduct in respect of a complainant was improperly discriminatory.  In that regard, the Act provides that I can uphold, substantially uphold or partially uphold a complaint where the conduct complained of was unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory in its application to the complainant.  I can also uphold a complaint, although the conduct complained of is in accordance with a law or an established practice or regulatory standard, if the law, practice or standard is, or may be, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory in its application to the complainant. <\/p><p> My office will not interfere with the commercial discretion of a financial service provider when it is exercised in a fair and reasonable manner.  This means that we will not interfere with how a provider charges for its services if the conduct involved is not unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory.   For charges not to be improperly discriminatory, however, I expect that the same criteria would be applied consistently and fairly to customers in establishing whether the conduct of a provider in charging consumers for its services is fair and reasonable.  This is particularly so, given the range of data used by providers together with the complex and opaque pricing techniques sometimes applied.  This makes it difficult to establish whether the charge was fair.  Understanding the factors that inform decisions of financial service providers is becoming even more difficult with the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the manner in which personal data and data from external sources are used to profile consumers.  Indeed, even identifying or recognising a dual pricing issue can present a challenge, as the complainants themselves would not necessarily recognise it or present it as such, and because a renewal quote will not necessarily be based on the exact same set of circumstances as the previous year. <\/p><p> I believe two of the main methods of combatting dual pricing are for insurers to provide consumers with clear and accurate information when they renew or incept insurance policies and for consumers to shop around regularly before taking out or renewing an insurance policy.  Where consumers believe that the conduct of a provider has been unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory they can make a complaint to my office.  <\/p><p> The Oireachtas has provided me with significant powers.  I can direct compensation of up to &euro;500,000 and I can also direct rectification, which could, for example, involve directing a financial service provider to reinstate a tracker mortgage rate or directing it to change the margin or the date from which a particular rate was applied.  As FSPO, I look beyond the contractual terms and consider the fairness and reasonableness of the conduct complained of.     <\/p><p> I assure the Chairman and members that, together with my management team here today, and my staff generally, I will continue to use the powers the Oireachtas has given me in an impartial manner to ensure a fair outcome in respect of complaints made to my office and we will continue to cooperate with the Central Bank in achieving better outcomes for consumers generally.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it today.

A while ago I read an article written by Charlie Weston in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>on 28 November 2009 where he said that one of Mr. Deering's predecessors, Mr. Joe Meade, had written to the then Financial Regulator asking that a probe be carried out because of some findings that he had arrived at, where some lenders had denied people the right to a tracker rate after coming off a fixed rate of interest.  Does Mr Deering believe that a lot of time was lost before this issue was escalated to the level that it should have been escalated to, which should have been much earlier?  It was late 2015 before the Central Bank instituted an industry-wide probe.  Has Mr. Deering reviewed the original files and correspondence from 2009 as to what the response was, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019111900002#C00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I certainly did go back and look at the individual files.  I came into the role of financial services ombudsman in April 2015.

One of the first things I did was carry out an analysis because I felt we had very valuable information in the office but the difficulty was that it was in hundreds of complaints files.  If I remember, more than 400 complaint filed formed part of that analysis.  At that stage, I put together analysis and gave a fairly considerable dossier of information that identified what had caused people to go off their trackers and why they could not go back on the trackers and the various triggers.  At that stage, we worked very closely with the Central Bank and it helped the Central Bank in scoping out the tracker mortgage exercise it put in place.

While we look at each individual complaint on its own merits, we are very conscious that any decision made could have implications beyond that particular complaint.  When the Central Bank came before the committee several weeks ago it explained, and I can confirm, that we are working very closely with it.  We send all of the tracker decisions to it for its information.  If we believe there is something to which we need to draw its attention we will do it separately by referring it specifically.  I expect that decisions on particular cohorts are then implemented by the bank in question.  I do not have the power to do this but it is the sensible thing.  Where the same set of circumstances applies, the same terms and conditions apply and the complaints are the same then obviously if one complaint is upheld it should be reflected in the others.  In theory, we could have to deal with each individual complaint.  I expect and hope the reality would be different and that as we start to issue decisions in the coming weeks that the banks will take them on board and apply them beyond the particular complaint we are dealing with.  I mentioned that I will publish the decisions and this will be a big help.  This will be of significant assistance to complainants and providers.  Complainants will be able to look at their particular set of circumstances and see how it measures and compares with the set of circumstances in a particular decision.  Based on the legislation I can only deal with each individual complaint in its own right but I expect, given the similarities between certain complaints, that it may not be necessary to issue decisions in every complaint.

I know of one very good person who was with us only for a few weeks who we would have loved to have kept.  He was from one of the Dublin suburbs.

We now spend much more time trying to explain and deal with people and challenges from providers as to whether a complaint is in or out.  Our preference at the time would have been a simpler approach of no time limit.  I accept that the Attorney General and other people had issues with that.

While we are all about resolving disputes and we want to leave the decision, as much as possible, to the complainant but we also do what we call reality checking because we have a responsibility to the people with whom we are dealing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019111900002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>It is good to hear that, because out-of-court settlements and confidentiality clauses can often provide unwarranted protection.

I am not sure whether he is aware of the research done in the United States that suggested it is predatory and unfair when there are two prices for the same risk, or of that done by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which identified the loyalty premium, whereby for every year a customer stays with a company, he or she will be hit by a higher premium.  The company expects the customer to renew and, therefore, does not base the premium on the basis of risk but rather on the fact that because he or she is more loyal to the customer than the chairperson is, he or she will be hit with a higher premium, even though they could have identical risk.  Would that be deemed as unfair?  The data show that if a customer renews his or her contract four times with the same company, for example, he or she will be hit by a loyalty premium of 40%.<\/p> <p>  I have to hand a copy of a renewal premium from a customer.  It is interesting that there was a renewal premium on 14 November, with the same policy number on each one.  The renewal premium rose this year, from &euro;1,044 to &euro;1,256.  That is dual pricing in action.  Most people do not know there is dual pricing but the customer was sent two quotations from the company, with the same policy number, with a difference of more than &euro;210 between the premiums.  If it can be substantiated that the insurance industry is hitting customers with a loyalty premium based on the renewal and not the risk, could that be adjudicated by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in favour of the consumer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019111900002#H00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>It is a possibility.

That will probably not arise to the same extent in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  Many of the points related to tracker mortgages have been raised.  To make a general point, the statement last week by KBC Bank's group chief executive, for which I acknowledge he more or less apologised, highlighted that the Irish Banking Culture Board has its work cut out for it because the view seems to be that we should just forget about the tracker issue and get on with it because it this issue was not a big deal.  The tracker mortgages issue was an enormous deal to the more than 40,000 families and households affected.  The committee has discussed this issue at length, as I am sure Mr. Deering's office will have noted.  As someone who is dealing with all the problems and seeing the banks at their worst rather than their best, where does Mr. Deering believe the Irish banking system has come in the past ten years?  Does it still have a lot of work to do to develop a culture in which fairness, transparency, openness and an understanding that the customer should be central becomes crucial in everything the banks do?  The remark made last week is fairly damaging.  It is damning in highlighting how some people are really thinking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019111900002#J00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":356,"content":"<p>Senator Horkan mentioned the Irish Banking Culture Board.

The culture board and my office have very different roles.  We respect its role and it respects our independent role.  We will work with it because anything that improves culture and how banks treat their customers is also part of our strategy.<\/p> <p>  To answer Senator Horkan's question, there is still some way to go.  I believe there has been an improvement.  We have seen an improvement on the complaints end in terms of the people in the banks who deal with us and try to resolve the complaints, particularly through mediation and so forth.  We often deal with the people who are trying to resolve complaints in the banks and we see that they are doing their best.  Sometimes, however, when a complaint goes back to the business unit, the same understanding does not seem to be shown.

However, if I phone up the company, the &euro;420 quote suddenly falls to &euro;360 and if I phone a second time, it is reduced to &euro;290.  I am not told the quote is being reduced by &euro;20 because I indicated I do not drive on weekends or after midnight or I do not do X, Y or Z.  This will be incredibly difficult.

I do not know what it is possible to do.  I do not think any of us is fully cognisant of what companies are capable of doing, including accessing our search histories and so on.  I see some people smiling.  Big data is everywhere.  I just wonder how a complainant or the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman will be able to prove a complaint that he or she was offered a different price based on discrimination.

This committee has done a huge amount of work on digging into the insurance industry and so on and in respect of the latest issue raised by Deputy Doherty, who has done a great deal of work on the issue of insurance and is to be credited for that.  In that area, the public finds it very difficult to deal with insurance companies.  One can search for a better quote and so on but there are people who do not have the ability to do that, particularly elderly people.  The banks would not encourage one to deal with them.  The insurance companies would not encourage one to deal with them, although one has to deal with them.  There must be a simpler way of making complaints and listening to people other than them having to come to our offices or us having to engage with Mr. Deering.  There are many people who would like to process complaints but who are simply not up to it, therefore.  They are being screwed either by the insurance company or the bank.

I want to raise two issues, one of which is dual pricing.  I have countless examples of people coming to me on the issue of dual pricing.  When I talk about dual pricing I am not referring to introductory offers, which can range from 10% to 20% up to a certain value.  I am talking about excluding them and looking at the price using the exact same data on which the insurance company has priced the renewal quote.  In some cases, it is huge.  I had a case of a 21 year old woman who was working part-time.  She got a loan from the credit union and bought a car for &euro;4,000.  Her insurance premium was just over &euro;4,000.  I asked her to give me all her details.  I put them into the same company's website and I got the premium for &euro;1,200 cheaper than her renewal quote.  That is dual pricing in action.  That company, Liberty Insurance online, offers a maximum reduction of 10% or up to the value of &euro;150.  Even if we were to discount that &euro;150, it would still be more than &euro;1,000 for the same person, the same risk, the same company and two different prices.<\/p> <p>  How would the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman be able to find the information?  What powers does he have to be able to go in and get that?  To take the case I mentioned, I have not given any details.  I do not think I gave the name of the company.  I gave the financial details.  What powers does Mr. Deering have to investigate whether, in respect of that case, there were discriminatory or unfair practices?  We have an industry that is under investigation by the European competition authority.  It was subject to raids and so on a number of years ago.  At the core of that is not sharing data.

We also have the powers of seizure to go in and collect evidence, if required.  We have not had occasion to use that but it is available to us.  The kernel of this point is that some of this information is buried in algorithms and very detailed information but we have the powers to collect the information.  We need to upskill ourselves sufficiently to analyse that information and to know how to deal with it, but it will be quite challenging to prove that.  I will not say otherwise.

I have written to the Central Bank about this but I have not got a response as of yet.  I am sure I will shortly.  It relates to death benefit insurance operated by credit unions.<\/p><p>The first credit union has withdrawn death benefit insurance from its members, despite the fact that 4,500 members who have been paying into the scheme have asked for it to continue.  It is being blamed on Central Bank regulations.  Gurranabraher credit union in Cork was the first to offer death benefit of &euro;4,000.  It said the Central Bank now has regulations that require 50% of the membership to want it for it to continue.  I have a question for Mr. Deering on this auto-renew financial product.  I have not seen the forms for this credit union but I have seen the forms for other credit unions that currently operate the scheme and they have not taken a decision to withdraw it at this point, but it may be just a timing issue.  It is a very simple form in some cases where it is &euro;1 or &euro;2 or whatever it is per week or per month, and it is on the basis of auto-renew.  There was no suggestion at any time that the credit union could withdraw this.  My colleagues in Cork have told me people have been paying into the scheme for 40 or 50 years.  They are now at a later stage in their life and they are relying on the &euro;4,000 to bury them but the service has been withdrawn from them overnight and everything they put into the scheme, which they could have done with over the 40 or 50 years, has been for naught.

For example, this can sometimes happen when an amalgamation takes place of smaller credits unions.  That has happened a lot.  It may be that a member might have had an option to go somewhere else that still provides the service had he or she known in time what was happening but he or she could have been incorporated into another credit union without knowing.  I can only give a general answer but if the complaint relates to the conduct of a financial service provider, we can accept the complaint.

It is important that regulation is effective without it being unduly onerous on the AHBs and that in no way does the regulator seek to control them.  It is also important the regulator is independent in its functions.

There are things that the regulator might want to charge fees for, even in interim.  They may not necessarily apply to AHBs but perhaps to members of the public if they want a copy of the register.  Perhaps someone wants to make an appeal and there may be a need to charge a fee for that reason.<\/p><p> The section 11 permits the regulator, when established, to charge fees under a number of other sections.  I do not want to take away the power of the regulator to charge a fee to an individual in a case where he or she might be looking for a copy of the register but, to alleviate the concerns of Deputies, I could propose the deletion of two of the sections that would give the regulator the powers to charge fees to AHBs.  For example, I could delete section 35(5).  Section 35 deals with the transfer period between when the regulator is established and AHBs are deemed to be registered, but they will register over a period.  Section 35 is only relevant for those first three years and within it subsection (5) provides for an AHB to be charged a fee by the regulator.  The Deputies are saying that we should just take that out because it will not be needed or used and it does not need to be there.  Section 28(2)(e) relates to applications to the register being accompanied by an appropriate fee.  Given that we have said that the AHB sector will pay fees for registration with the RTB, in the initial stages we do not want to charge any fees in this regard.  I think that, again to alleviate concerns, if we remove that section then it will not be possible.<\/p><p> Section 11 is about warehousing, but I do not know if that is the best way to put it.  It is a framework by which the other sections will be implemented, but if we take out those two sections, the Deputies' fears will be alleviated.  However, the regulator can still charge fees in the normal course of business to someone looking for a copy of the register or to someone making an appeal at a later stage in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2019111900002#C02300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":484,"content":"<p>That is helpful.

That is common practice.  It will not be about setting a new policy when it comes to matters such as standards.  This is about financial standards, governance standards and performance standards.  They should be reported on in such a way that people are clear that they were in line with policy or what is in the law.  It will still be the role of the RTB to have that involvement and that place for the tenant and the landlord.  We are not trying to step into the role of the RTB.  A letter to this effect was sent to members of the committee by the Housing Agency.  I do not know if everyone saw it.  It was a three or four page letter, making the point that it was not seeking to move into someone else's space, to move outside policy or to change policy.  This was about financial performance, governance performance and standards performance, so that people can see that things are being done with regard to response time for repairs or bringing voids back into use.

I have a group of AHB tenants who have complained about the lack of good sound insulation between units.  They have looked for an independent audit of the properties, which are in an estate called Cualanor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is quite a big estate.  That has not been provided.  They have done their own audit which basically states that the developer says the standards are fine, having taken a decibel-measuring machine around, but the residents are adamant that there is a major problem with sound between the units.  If those were council tenants, a local councillor could go to the council chamber on their behalf and say they are moving a motion to say there should be an independent audit.  If that motion was passed, there would be an independent audit to see whether there was a sound problem.<\/p><p> AHB tenants do not have that same recourse.  They can go to the RTB but it will only enforce minimal legal standards.  It cannot take the next step of saying it is just not happy with this and it is not good enough, even if it just about meets minimum standards.  I would be interested to hear the Minister address that.  To add to the complexity of it, if one takes this particular instance, these people were allocated places from the council housing list by the council.  They go into these AHBs but there is also a property management company and a private developer involved.  They have to deal with all these different layers, whereas if they were council tenants, there would be another form of recourse, which I have described.  One-stop shop would not be quite the right word but a tenant would know that he or she could go to a person and actually get something done.  I ask the Minister to comment on that because it is a problem which will become bigger.  The Minister will probably not agree with me but I think the Government is overly reliant on AHBs to deliver social housing and this will become a bigger issue.  We need to ensure that all social housing tenants, whatever type of social housing they are in, have the same rights and avenues for addressing problems as each other and that there is not a downgrading or dilution of the forms of recourse that they have because they happen to be in a particular AHB.

A further disadvantage is that as one's life changes, one may wish to move to a local authority housing estate, perhaps for family reasons or because it is nearer the school one's child attends.  There are certainly issues in that regard.  To date in any event, I have never found an AHB that does not want to meet the requirements of the tenant, although the cases the Deputy outlined are more complex because they are part of other, privately-developed housing.  I would not disagree with ensuring a right to an audience with an elected representative but the matter cannot be brought to a council because it will not be responsible, which is the difficulty.

We do not get a veto on the matter or make a decision.  The regulation is then put to the House by way of a motion.  However, we are consulted and there is a value in that.  There have been a few instances where the Minister's interaction with this committee on some draft planning matters has influenced the final shape of them for the better.  That is why the Minister should consider some mechanism to give this committee a consultative role when those changes are made.  If they are being made in line with democratically agreed legislative, budgetary or policy decisions, I have no problem with that.  The difficulty is that the provision as it stands would also allow a Minister to direct the regulator beyond that.

I understand that the legislation is framed to move the regulatory framework to the next step, the statutory footing, and that, at a later stage, other issues, such as a resolution process and fund, may be addressed.  Over the next decade, small voluntary-sector and in many cases rural approved housing bodies with very small numbers of units, set up by voluntary boards, will have board members retiring, passing away or moving on.  We could end up with stock that starts to become the subject of resolution and transfer to larger bodies or bodies that are more competent.  There are major issues involved in this and I am not saying it is in any way easy.  Considerable issues arise over the condition of the stock, the mechanism by which stock is transferred, who makes the decision and with whose consent, the source of the funding, and whether there are sinking funds or structural issues.  I accept this is not the Bill in which to deal with all these matters.  That case has been made convincingly, and I have been convinced.  I have moved the amendment, however, because I still believe it deals with work that needs to be examined over the coming years by the Department.  This is the only mechanism I can put on the table to allow me to make this important point.<\/p><p>The Minister was not here when I last raised the issue of a very considerable stock transfer of very newly built units in my constituency.  It is a matter of public record.  Cara Housing Association had to transfer some of the units from M&eacute;ile an R&iacute; drive back to the local authority.  They were the subject of a very significant controversy over a company called Gama.  It was widely documented in the press at the time.  The building quality was of such a poor standard that the approved housing body could no longer finance the maintenance of the stock.  There was a very public transfer.  That was not necessarily the happiest of transfers.  I am not saying the local authority commented on it publicly but it had to take on significant additional liability.<\/p><p>Resolution will become an issue whether we like it or not.  The decision-making process and financing will become issues.<\/p><p>The Minister is going to explain why he cannot accept the amendment but I would like him to at least accept the spirit in which I am raising this issue.

I have never done that and it is actually very rare for someone to go outside the PAS in making appointments.  When they are brought to the Cabinet, a Minister has to state if a person has not been appointed through the PAS and explain why.  It is quite rare to go outside the PAS.  I can think of an example in which I would potentially need to go outside the PAS in this instance.  In the case of the voluntary regulator, we had a tenant representative as a member, a tenancy advocate and it was difficult to find a replacement for that person.  The public appointments system is great and only from time to time is there a need to step outside it.  I am trying to think of a time when I might have stepped outside it.  I have probably done so once, but it is rare.

I can confirm that the Public Appointments Service continues to review the level of demand for the provision of our services through the Irish language by monitoring the number of queries, requests and applications received through Irish.  We are aware, however, that there is likely to be a latent demand for services across the public service to be delivered through Irish owing to the fact that, due to previous poor experiences, people engage with the service through English.  This is understandably frustrating for the Irish language speakers, and PAS has focused, therefore, on improving and promoting the services we offer to Irish language speakers.<br\/><br\/>PAS is the recruitment and resourcing service provider for client organisations in the civil and public service.  It is responsible for the sourcing, assessment and delivery of quality candidates to those clients.  We run a wide variety and range of openly advertised and interdepartmental promotion competitions within the Civil Service.  We also recruit the most senior levels in local authorities, trainee garda&iacute;, and a range of management, executive and specialist roles across the Civil Service and public service.<br\/><br\/>PAS also has a key role in the identification of suitable members for appointment to State boards.  PAS has a good track record of providing services through Irish, and we have prepared a number of Irish language schemes aimed at improving the delivery of services through Irish for our various customer groups.  We provide services through Irish to Irish speakers who make contact with our office.  The office has arrangements in place to put members of the public in touch with minimum delay with an appropriate member of staff who can deal with their business, whether in the English or Irish language.<br\/><br\/>Over recent  years our website, <i>publicjobs.ie,<\/i>has been the main channel for managing and delivering our recruitment services and businesses.  There is a tab at the top of our website whereby candidates may choose to have the content displayed in Irish or English.  The Irish version of this website is a dynamic rather than a static one, with new jobs advertised in both the English and Irish languages.  The candidate registration facility is in both official languages and the job title, job description and application form are available in both official languages during the application period.  Information booklets are available in both official languages for general service grades, posts in Gaeltacht communities, posts where the Irish language is a particular requirement, and posts under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  Of the 518,905 members of the public registered with <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>, 4,131 have indicated a preference for doing their business with PAS through Irish.  All of the messages issued to these users are sent in the official language of their choice.<br\/><br\/>PAS is also responsible for the recruitment and selection of candidates with proficiency in Irish to meet the needs of clients.  A Government decision of 30 October 2013 approved the introduction of measures to support Irish language proficiency in the Civil Service and replace the bonus marking policy with measures that seek to increase the cohort of functional bilinguals in the Civil Service.  PAS initially introduced Irish language proficiency as a separate stream for general service recruitment competitions.  More recently, we run stand-alone competitions to establish panels for entry grades.  In these cases, all of the selection processes are conducted through Irish.  These include clerical officer competitions in 2018, and we are advertising a nationwide executive officer, EO, competition this weekend as well as putting plans in place to advertise for the higher executive officer, HEO, competition in 2020 for candidates with fluency in Irish.<br\/><br\/>We are aware that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has put measures in place to promote the Irish language as a career option in the public service.  This includes the Conradh na Gaeilge Se&oacute; B&oacute;thair to target second and third level students and those attending Gaeltacht summer colleges.  PAS sent a team to the recent ESB Creative Tech Fest in the National Conference Centre, which was attended by many Irish-speaking second level students.  We hope that these initiatives will increase the numbers of suitably qualified candidates applying for Irish language roles.<br\/><br\/>Overall, 64 general grade assignments were made to Irish language posts since 2016, ranging from 35 clerical officers to two assistant principal officers.  Clerical officer panels for 15 counties were put in place through the 2018 competition.  Fifteen candidates were assigned through this process and all the panels were exhausted.  The overall number who applied for Irish language clerical officer was 259 compared with 14,013 for the general clerical officer competition.  These numbers demonstrate the challenges we are facing in attracting Irish-speaking candidates through the public service.<br\/><br\/>PAS continues to conduct Irish language proficiency tests for roles that it recruits for on behalf of the local authorities.  Those who demonstrate proficiency in both official languages are awarded an additional 6% of the total marks available at interview for such proficiency.  We also recruit Garda trainees and have run six recruitment campaigns since 2013.  Each of these has had an Irish language stream.  Eighty-three Garda trainee candidates qualified through these streams since 2013.<br\/><br\/>We note a significant drop between the number of applications received for the Irish language stream and the numbers completing the tests.  It has been our experience across competitions that many candidates applied for the Irish language stream, but when contacted, they did not have the fluency or wish to proceed through that stream.  The newly-introduced model of running competitions specifically for Irish language, such as the HEO and EO, may improve this issue for us.<br\/><br\/>PAS also recruits for posts across the public service where the ability to communicate effectively in Irish is an essential requirement, including a range of primary district inspector and translator roles.  We also recruit for posts across the public service where the ability to have a good and reasonable knowledge of Irish is an essential requirement.  Since 2013, PAS has recruited for 11 different examination assessment manager roles in the State Examinations Commission.  PAS uses both internal and external resources to support the provision of service through Irish, including the development and maintenance of a list of potential selection board members with the ability and proficiency to carry out selection processes through the Irish language.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the website, marketing materials such as leaflets and banners are provided in both the English and Irish languages at careers fairs, conferences and events.  We also advertise in <i>Seachtain<\/i>, <i>Tuairisc.ie<\/i>, PEIG, LinkedIn, and Facebook to target Gaeltacht areas specifically.<br\/><br\/>All staff are provided with information on the Irish language services provided by PAS and information on the contents of the Irish language scheme.  To promote Irish informally with staff, PAS has some common phrases in Irish and their equivalent in English on the office&rsquo;s intranet, and these are updated regularly.  We also provide Irish language training for staff and highlight further opportunities for training and qualifications available to staff interested in developing their skills further so that they are confident in providing services through Irish.  Three staff have completed such training in the past two years and six staff have recently commenced this training.  Given the relative size of our organisation, this is very encouraging.<br\/><br\/>PAS has had a translator on staff since 2002 and is currently filling the vacancy arising from the retirement of our translator earlier this year.  Two clerical officers were also sourced from the Irish panel in 2017 and work in areas of recruitment that have the highest demand for services through Irish.  In addition to the translator, PAS has seven Irish speakers who provide services to the public through Irish.  It is expected that the six staff currently undergoing Irish language training and the newly recruited translator will also provide such services from 2020.<br\/><br\/>All of our publications and general support material for candidates and the general public are available in both official languages, for example, our customer charter and annual report, etc.<br\/><br\/>We are also committed to supporting Irish candidates applying for roles in the EU institutions.

We currently have six people in training and we have already trained three.  By the end of it, when these people are trained, we should have 15 people on staff who can provide services.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's other question related to the applicant pool and how we attract Irish speakers.  A lot of work is being done with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with regard to selling careers in the public service to Irish speakers.  I understand that there has been an increase resulting from work on CAO points with regard to the Irish language.  The Department is also sponsoring things like masters level qualifications.  These are also funded by a centre of excellence for EU careers.  There are many interventions at various stages in second and third level institutions to sell the public service as an attractive career and, as the Deputy has mentioned, to increase the pool of applicants who speak Irish.<br\/><br\/>As I said in my opening statement, the numbers are very stark.  Almost 519,000 applicants have registered on <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>, of which more than 4,000 have indicated that they want to conduct their business with us through Irish.  It is quite a small pool.  We are aware that there is likely to be pent-up demand.  It is a matter of participating and partnering with Departments when they are rolling out initiatives, particularly the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, for obvious reasons.  We are quite dynamic in making sure that, when we are selling roles on <i>publicjobs.ie<\/i>, our services are provided through Irish and that it is as easy as possible for Irish speakers to conduct their business with us through Irish.  We welcome such communication.  We go to great lengths to make sure that we do that.  Promoting that is very important.<br\/><br\/>On the Deputy's earlier point about panels where a person must specify a preference for English or Irish and people opting for the English stream, we will find out over the next six months or so whether having specific Irish-only competitions will increase the applicant pool.  These are a number of things we are thinking about with regard to increasing the candidate pool and promoting engagement with the Public Appointments Service through Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Comerford"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":748,"content":"<p>Ba &iacute; an cheist ar chuir m&eacute; faoin bhfoireann n&aacute; c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad baill foirne at&aacute; ag an tseirbh&iacute;s in ioml&aacute;n?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#C00500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":749,"content":"<p>We have 200 staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Comerford"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":750,"content":"<p>Go maith.

In the Garda trainee recruitment campaigns, which we have been running annually for the past six years, one of the requirements is that candidates have proven proficiency in two languages, one of which must be either English or Irish.  In cases where the candidates do not meet this requirement, the regulation allows us to undertake assessments that prove their competency in the Irish language.  We have designed tests to ensure that the candidates' language proficiency is at the appropriate level.  At the time of application, candidates have two options.  They can apply for the general stream, the Irish language stream, or both.  They are then permitted to sit stage 1, the online tests, and stage 2, and their scores at these stages are used for both streams.  If they are successful at these stages, they are then called forward to stage 3.  This consists of a competency-based interview in each language.  Candidates then have the choice to proceed with one or both streams.  If they are successful at interview, they are then forwarded to Garda headquarters for further processing.  The statistics for these competitions, which the members will have seen in my submission, show the number of applicants for the Irish language stream of the Garda competition who drop out between submitting an application and completing the tests.  It has been our experience that many candidates tick the box to indicate they wish to apply for the Irish language stream, but when we make contact with them, they do not have fluency or do not wish to proceed with that stream of the competition.<\/p><p> This problem is not unique to Irish language campaigns.  We have experience of candidates ticking boxes to say that they meet other criteria only for us to realise that they do not as we move through the processes.  That is what we are trying to do with the model of running competitions specifically for Irish-speaking candidates.  This will allow us to see whether there is a correlation between dropout rates and application rates and how effective our awareness campaigns and advertising have been.  We may then be able to draw some conclusions from our findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Comerford","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I dtaca leis sin, molaim don Seirbh&iacute;s um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; ceist a chur ar si&uacute;d a thit amach as pr&oacute;iseas earca&iacute;ochta an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We will be able to look at that in 2020 after we have run that competition to see if that has made an impact.  That is one of the things we are doing differently to see if we can widen that candidate pool, as well as all the other things we are doing around reaching out to the second and third level institutions, partnering with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on its roadshows, looking for ways where we can engage and work with Departments that have specific requirements.

As the committee will be aware, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has set up a committee, of which the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and ourselves are members, and they can also ask others to take part in this.  As the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has said, &quot;research will be commissioned aimed at identifying <i>inter alia<\/i>priority areas for the recruitment of Irish speaking officials and the provision of services in Irish&quot;.  Then the Department gives a list and we can provide the committee with details of that.  Both the PAS and we are intimately involved with that group.  As committee members know, it is a six-year plan and part of it is about recruiting functional bilinguals and more Irish speakers and examining how we can do that.  There is also an issue in that our Irish-speaking people see careers in primary teaching, for example, whereas they may not be aware the Civil Service also offers rewarding careers for Irish speakers.  People can move around in the Civil Service.  If a person gets a job that requires Irish, he or she is not restricted to remaining in that area unless he or she wishes to.<\/p><p>The recent mobility scheme for clerical officers, COs, and EOs allows people to click on a button that allows them to stay in an Irish language area if they prefer to do so.  If an Irish language job comes up they can apply for that themselves rather than applying for English-speaking jobs so we are trying to address the issue.  We also have to recall that the moratorium was only lifted in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Meehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":898,"content":"<p>Tuigim &eacute; sin agus t&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil coiste idir-Rannach i gceist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#K00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>It is a big-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2019111900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Meehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":900,"content":"<p>T&aacute; a fhios agam &eacute; sin ach t&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de agus &oacute; thaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta de.

Chuaigh l&iacute;on na mball foirne &oacute; 58 nduine go 102 dhuine le linn an tr&eacute;imhse c&eacute;anna.  D&rsquo;eagraigh s&eacute; ceithre chom&oacute;rtas oscailte le haghaidh foireann bhuan.  In ainneoin na hiarrachta comhph&aacute;irt&iacute; nach beag, n&iacute; raibh na tortha&iacute; ach go measartha.

The purpose of the meeting is to continue our deliberations on the topic of the impact of education on the Traveller community.  We have had one meeting on this topic and two more are scheduled after today.  It may be worth making some observations and mentioning some facts as a way of framing our conversation.  As an opening reflection, I emphasise that education is a key issue for Travellers and that Travellers value education greatly.  As the delegates point out in their submission - I apologise for stealing their words - it is a &quot;real misconception&quot; to think otherwise.  Travellers experience significant barriers at all levels as they seek to access education.  Schools can be a very cold place for them.  Even though people can start out with great enthusiasm, it is often the case that their experience when they land in school is not conducive to flourishing in that space.<\/p><p>Traveller history and culture are still not reflected in the school curriculum.  The massive cuts to Traveller education services made in the 2000s have not yet been restored or reversed.  Traveller children are more likely to have timetables with reduced hours.  This issue has been examined in great detail by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  It is sobering and arresting for this committee to think about the fact that just 80% of Travellers transfer from primary to secondary school.  Traveller children are 50 times more likely than children from the general population to leave school without completing the leaving certificate examinations.  Just 13% of female Travellers are educated to upper secondary level, as opposed to 69% of the general population.  According to the last census, just 167 Travellers have a third level qualification.  As a consequence, the unemployment rate among Travellers is 80%.  I am sure all of the statistics I have mentioned will be discussed again.<\/p><p>I welcome Ms Shreya Chaturvedi, a development worker with the Yellow Flag programme.  She is accompanied by Mr. Bernard Joyce, the director of the Irish Traveller Movement; Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in, with whom I had the pleasure of working closely for a full year and who is incredibly helpful in the proceedings and the work that is ongoing in the Oireachtas on Travellers' rights and issues; and Mr. Martin Collins from Pavee Point.  They are extremely welcome.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

My input is as a development worker of the Yellow Flag programme.  I am joined by Mr. Bernard Joyce, director of the Irish Traveller Movement.  The Yellow Flag programme is an innovative whole-school initiative which supports schools to celebrate diversity, promote inclusion and challenge racism.<\/p> <p>  Pioneered initially by the Irish Traveller Movement as an intercultural innovative solution to address poor educational experiences and outcomes for Travellers, it took account of similar exclusion and marginalisation faced by other ethnic minorities and created a programme to encompass children from both majority and minority backgrounds, including Travellers.  The programme is goal-centred and accreditation focused under which schools are obliged to meet targets over a comprehensive eight-step strategy.  It is not an optional soft-choice programme but one that requires change to be monitored and visible both in the student population and among the staff and the community.<\/p> <p>  The Yellow Flag programme recognises the risk factors and the potential for Travellers and other ethnic minority children to experience disconnection and insecurity within schools and so the whole-school approach is vital to fostering positive identity among all pupils.  However, even with efforts towards Yellow Flag accreditation, school bias and discrimination towards Travellers is so ingrained that in addressing racism among diverse groups, often teachers and school management are blind to the experience of Travellers and their and the school's unconscious bias.  Factors such as identity-based exclusion, historical prejudice, conscious and unconscious bias, absence of Travellers in teaching and school management, institutional racism and poor awareness and knowledge of Traveller culture within teaching practice all have a detrimental effect on the educational progression and learning of young Travellers, and on their sense of identity and self-belief.<\/p> <p>  The National Traveller Survey 2017 revealed that four out of ten Travellers said they or their children were bullied in school.  In 2017 the Department of Justice and Equality commissioned an ESRI report, A Social Portrait of Travellers, which found Travellers are more than 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate in comparison to the non-Traveller population.  Even within Yellow Flag schools, racism towards Travellers dramatically increases in post-primary settings and it is not uncommon to find examples of Traveller students who are actively involved in the Yellow Flag primary schools who dropped out after their transition to a secondary school that was not involved in the programme.<\/p> <p>  Since 2009 the Yellow Flag programme has worked with 87 schools, 61 families and 26 post-primary schools.  That is a significant number given the limited resources available to the programme.  The programme has reached 33,535 students and more than 2,600 teachers, yet 53% of the pupils who took part in the intercultural surveys in 2009 as part of the programme recorded that they had witnessed racist comments or behaviours towards others in their school.  That is the reason the following recommendations are very important.  In order to be able to strengthen and secure the long-term impact it can have on the Irish education system, the Yellow Flag programme needs to be mainstreamed across all primary and secondary schools.  In addition to addressing the demand that already exists, it is imperative to reach out to schools with very few or no Traveller students as well.  To really impact Traveller participation, retention and progression in the education system it would be valuable to introduce a Yellow Flag model for preschool and third level settings as well.  As part of the continuing professional development, CPD, for teaching staff, anti-racist and intercultural training should be mandatory to actively inform the school staff to be mindful of their behaviour towards students from minority ethnic groups, especially Travellers.  Strong legislation towards a national anti-racism policy for schools is essential to encourage the Traveller community to remain in school and, therefore, reduce barriers to accessing second and third level education.  Clear links with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would be critical in achieving a long-term impact.  However, to date, no concrete connection has been established despite their efforts.<\/p><p>I am happy to answer any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Shreya Chaturvedi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":972,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Chaturvedi.

When people speak of Travellers, it is my experience that we as Travellers are rarely the ones who are speaking and, ever rarer, the ones who are heard.<\/p> <p>  I am currently manage St. Oliver&rsquo;s education centre, Cloverhill.  We mainly engage with adults over the age of 18.  Those who engage with the centre are predominantly from the Traveller community.  Many of the newer students were young when draconian cuts were made to Traveller-specific resources in 2011 and 2012.  That was when the visiting teachers service for Travellers was disbanded, resource teachers for Travellers were no longer deployed, cuts to the 1.5 additional teacher hours were made, and all senior Traveller training centres were closed, without a suitable alternative.  The continued effects of the cuts, compounded by low expectations and the system being either disinterested in or having difficulty in engaging with Travellers, owing to a very settled narrative, continue to be reflected daily in the lives of young people.<\/p> <p>  At this stage, the committee will be very well aware of the statistics surrounding Travellers in general as well as those on education, but I will repeat them because, while they are numbers, they are also reflective of people's lives.  According to the CSO 2016 census, just 13.3% of Traveller females have an upper second level education.  Nearly six in every ten Traveller males were educated to primary level at the very most, and only 167 Travellers have a third level qualification.  According to the ERSI's report, A Social Portrait of Travellers in Ireland, dated 2017, Travellers are 50 times more likely to leave school without the leaving certificate and only 9% of those aged between 25 and 34 have completed second level education.<\/p> <p>  There exists a very real misconception within the wider community that Travellers do not value education.  This is not true.  There exists among all people a desire to prosper, grow and learn, and the doorways created by education are greatly valued and desired by Travellers.  However, many of these doorways are locked to us.  They can be locked by the under-provision of accommodation, the consequences of poverty, when education strategies just remain strategies, and when they, the doorways, are not even considered to be for us.  Sometimes when they are open, they have been opened by those who may know very little about us, or a lot about us that is erroneous.<\/p> <p>  Currently, there are programmes in place in regard to third level education for Travellers.  These are much needed and very warmly welcomed but they will be little more than bandages on deep wounds when the vast majority of Travellers do not finish second level.  The majority of Travellers who leave the education system early leave at second level.  Additional strategies and programmes are needed at this level to support retention and completion.  We also need to be more aware of intersectionality within the community and create robust programmes that include and support it.  Currently, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy has only one action in regard to disabilities, action 12, which seeks to facilitate children at preschool level.  The ESRI report states, by way of age comparison, that 10% of Travellers have a learning disability, 13% experience mobility limitations and 11% have difficulty in getting to school or work due to a long-term condition or disability.  Consideration of this intersectionality is essential if we are to make progress.<\/p> <p>  A very real and bright blessing in my life has been my involvement in regard to the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, a Bill that seeks to be part of a process of ensuring schools are safer places for Traveller children, a process in which our identities will not be denied, reduced or removed, and a process in which all children and young people learn about who we really are, not only as an attempt to remove the biases and suspicions we live with but also to reflect a very real, truer Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Since 2001, the NCCA has made recommendations to include Traveller culture and history in the curriculum but, in conjunction with a recent NCCA audit, it was proven that these recommendations have largely failed, with only two optional modules in the senior cycle being directly inclusive of Travellers.  I understand that the Minster of Education and Skills remains very open to the process and I feel we must step away from the charity of potentially being included to an assurance that we will be.  Sadly, time has shown that when Travellers are a choice, they are just not chosen.  To do other than what I propose places a great weight of responsibility for the education of students, teachers and the institutions on the shoulders of children.  <\/p> <p>  We need to ensure that intercultural awareness training is mandatory for teachers, regardless of who they are teaching, as there is a wide array of opinions and practices, deliberate or unconscious, that can be devastating to the young.  Education should be in a place of safety, it should be aware, and it should be accessible and for all.  Programmes help and projects can bring some opportunities for progression but without an authentic structural change, we will be forever an add-on.  Our children and yours deserve much better than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":974,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Martin Collins from Pavee Point to make the opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#J00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":975,"content":"<p>I will be extremely brief.  We have provided our submission and as the Chairman said, the committee has already had one hearing on the issue of Travellers and education.  Also, I am reminded that I and many others were in this building twice this year already speaking about Travellers and the challenges in respect of education.  Some reports have come from that, one on progression from primary to second level.  I believe there is a second report on the issue of reduced timetables, but I am open to correction on that, so people are well versed on the issues and the challenges facing Travellers in the education system.  Nonetheless, we welcome once again this opportunity to address the joint committee on some of the challenges and, potentially, some of the solutions.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman made an opening comment about misconceptions.  It is also a misconception to say that Travellers drop out of education.  It is more a question of being pushed out of education when we have a system that is monocultural, that only reflects a majority perspective and culture, where there is no positive reinforcement or visibility of Traveller culture and Traveller identity, and where we have racism and discrimination.  As we all know, the school yard and the classroom can be a microcosm of the wider society.  All those issues are major factors in terms of Travellers not being able to access, participate in and get decent outcomes in terms of educational attainment.  I prefer to use the term \"pushed out\" rather than \"dropped out\".  That was certainly my experience having attended primary school many years ago.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on some of the recommendations we see as being key but before doing that I will make a more general point.  We are living in very difficult and challenging times in Ireland in terms of human rights and equality across the board, not just for Travellers.  There is no doubt that we have seen an increase in right-wing rhetoric and populism.  I remind the members that we cannot be complacent about that.  We need to be vigilant and we need strong political leadership in addressing racism and the rise of the right in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In light of that, we welcome the recent consultative process in respect of hate speech and hate crime that the Department of Justice and Equality is carrying out.  We all know that racism and discrimination can happen at many levels.  It can happen at the individual level and also at the institutional level.  We see the negative impacts of that in every aspect of Travellers' lives.  This is clearly evident in the area of education, from what Mr. De Bhaird&uacute;in and the Chairman said in terms of the statistics, which I will not repeat.<\/p> <p>  I am also reminded of the first Hispanic judge in the United States Supreme Court.  Her name is Sonia Sotomayor.  She once said that unless we get equality in education, we will not have an equal society.  The educational system, in my opinion, perpetuates that inequality.<\/p> <p>  A recent UNICEF report stated that Traveller children are still falling between the cracks, with the vast majority of Traveller children ceasing education before their junior certificate examination.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the recommendations, we are all well versed on the statistics.  The challenge is to create a more inclusive learning context that promotes respect for diversity and interculturalism and that addresses racism at all its levels and in all its guises.  One way of achieving that is through the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, which we welcome.  We hope that Bill will be adopted and fully implemented, thereby ensuring Travellers will have positive reinforcement of their identity within the school curriculum.<\/p> <p>  We also need to deal with the culture of low expectations that many teachers and principals have in respect of Travellers.  When that continues, it limits Travellers achieving their full potential and goals in life.<\/p> <p>  We want to see the re-establishment of the Traveller education advisory forum.  Traveller organisations have no real way of feeding into the development and implementation of education policy.  We want to see the re-establishment of that consultative forum, which was disbanded in 2016.<\/p><p>We want to see the development of a new Traveller education strategy.  What we have is piecemeal.  There is a sub-committee of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion steering group, NTRIS, but we do not have a clear strategy or policy for or on Traveller education.  We want to see the restoration of the savage cuts made to the Traveller education budget, to the tune of 85%, imposed during the austerity period.<\/p><p> As I said in this room previously, we cannot deal with Traveller education in isolation from other issues.  There is an interdependence in terms of access to secure, adequate and high quality accommodation, employment and healthcare and in addressing entrenched and institutionalised racism.  We need a multifaceted, multi-agency, co-ordinated and structured approach to address these issues.  Addressing one in isolation from the others is doomed to failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":977,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I will ask some general questions and whoever wishes to respond can do so.  The questions do not target a particular contribution.<\/p> <p>  The education system has not owned up to the way it treats Travellers.  I have far too many heated debates with teachers about the culture of low expectations.  It is very much a case of \"but...\"  It is believed teachers are well meaning, but somehow the fact is ignored that they do not spend time in empowering a young Traveller child and going on a journey with them or his or her family.  I would welcome comments on the low expectations for Traveller children, something I have experienced. Travellers are ostracised, even within my community.  They feel the low level of expectations even more than I do.  What impact does this have on the Traveller community?  How do we address the issue?  The Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill is one measure, but the psyche of teachers and school principals has not allowed them to acknowledge that that is the way they treat Traveller children.  How can we even begin to make sure we change that culture if they are not even willing to stand up and accept that this is what they create in the classroom?  At second level, in particular, there is a culture of ignoring Traveller children to the point where they just move away.  It almost seems to be the approach taken by teachers to push children out of the system, as Mr. Collins said, and make life a little easier for them in the classroom in not having to acknowledge their own bias.  What can we do to get people to take ownership of the issue of their low expectations for the Traveller community?  Are there positive examples to which to point in Ireland where schools are getting it right?  Is there any school that comes to mind where what it is doing is good?  Is there even one positive example that we could look to expand?  The Yellow Flag programme will be launched in schools.  Have the delegates come across a school that they can say has created the right environment for Traveller children?<\/p> <p>  How do we begin to support families to advocate for their children in the education system?  I refer to a child who had a negative experience of the school system as a Traveller and is going back as a parent.  As he or she never felt he or she had been heard as a student, why would he or she be heard as a parent?  How can we support parents to advocate for their children in a system that can be cruel and cold?<\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Education and Skills asked Mr. Collins to come before it.  It was done at the very last minute, but the committee was looking at the question of digital competency.  If Traveller children are already falling way behind and being pushed out of the education system, what will it mean in the context of how quickly we are moving in acquiring digital competencies and skills - digital literacy - within the workforce?  Are there programmes within the education system aimed at young Traveller children to enable them to acquire digital literacy skills?<\/p><p>I am particularly concerned about class bias in algorithms and how people are being kept out of employment or the education system just because of their surname or address.  This will have a considerable impact on the Traveller community.

There is a multidisciplinary team involved consisting of Travellers, an education welfare officer and a home&ndash;school liaison official.  The pilots are for two years and are funded by the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.  That must be acknowledged.  The aim of the pilots is to support Traveller access, participation and progression throughout the education system.  Part of the team's remit will be to work with Traveller parents and to advocate for and empower them to develop the confidence and skill set to engage with school staff, including the principal, to ensure the best interest of their children is being met.  There is a national oversight committee for that.  It includes Traveller organisations.  The programme will be reviewed and documented.  If it proves to be effective, it should be expanded to other parts of the country.  That is a positive development that I wish to acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  There is a commitment in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy to develop an affirmative action programme that would give Travellers the opportunity to gain access to teacher training colleges to become teachers.  That is really important because the only way one can develop trust and confidence in any institution is when one sees one's own face reflected back when one looks at it.  The same principle applies to the Garda and other institutions.  That is probably the most effective way, albeit not the only way, of developing trust and confidence among Travellers in the education system.  It is when they see their own faces in the system as teachers and principals.  That is where we really need to be heading.  We need to be very ambitious, not timid.  We need to make it happen.

We are putting much-needed resources into them and I hope they will be successful.<\/p> <p>  We must ask about how we are challenging existing structures.  Are we creating another avenue for people to prosper without actually challenging the core?  We must educate teachers who are already in our institutions; otherwise we are creating something that does not need to be there.<\/p> <p>  I was part of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's audit of best practice in schools across the country.  We genuinely struggled.  We came across cases where schools were doing quite well because of teachers or principals who were doing their best, but the work was based on the personality and individual interventions of the teachers and principals rather than on a structure based on the Traveller children engaging daily.  In itself, this resulted in hesitation.  A model based on a very limited number of people, who could potentially move on, could be pushed as best practice rather than ensuring support structures are maintained.<\/p><p>On the need for ongoing audits, I am aware that when schools undergo their own audits, they will look to ensure the inclusion of Travellers within the curriculum.  This also needs to be done in a way that audits and reviews of schools look at how they present the language and tuition on Travellers in a normative way, and that the Traveller community itself can be part of that process.  If one asks schools if they are doing well in that regard, the chances are that they will respond that they are.  We need to have our voices at that table as a counter narrative to show if there are gaps developing, perhaps in a very authentic way, and then we can highlight them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":984,"content":"<p>As part of the Yellow Flag programme, all schools in the programme are required to go through diversity and equality training.

In October 2018, we conducted an independent evaluation, results of which show that 70% of the schools said their staff had a better understanding of racism, 72% said their staff had a better understanding of cultural diversity and 63% said their staff had the opportunity to discuss and raise relevant issues.  These are positive findings considering the limited scale as we are only able to provide two hours of training to every school that we go to.  This is not even enough time to go deep into the relevant issues.  Given this limitation, these are positive findings.<\/p> <p>  We have also developed an additional digital training course, which is the Yellow Flag self-awareness training, through which we encourage teachers, other school staff and parents to do in groups.  This helps to explore hidden biases and how people can make sure it does not affect their delivery in the classroom.  The fourth step of the programme requires an intercultural survey to be done by all students and parents of the school.  In a lot of those surveys, many statistics and open-ended answers come out, which make the teachers realise they are probably not thinking about the issue enough.  They are supposed to develop an action plan based on that, which makes sure they are addressing each and everything that comes up in the intercultural survey.  Even then, as I said earlier, the bias is so ingrained that as a development worker - and many more people before me - I have had to point out certain issues that are particular to the treatment of Travellers.  We have to make sure the issues are pointed out and that they do something about it.  We are happy to provide the committee with many good examples in schools, especially primary schools, that have included Travellers extremely well.

One of the issues was identity bullying, with young people reporting physical and verbal abuse.  Another was that of low expectations, with reports of teachers putting Travellers at the back of classrooms.  We are not talking about 20 years ago but now.  Young Travellers raised the issue of teachers not valuing them as much as their settled peers and using them for sports instead of academia.  They need more support and information in school, for example, assistance with grant applications and the cost of same.  Despite the talk about supporting people in education, we are not giving young people that support.<\/p> <p>  On incomes, Mr. Collins alluded to how the Traveller economy was in decline.  As such, there is a need to increase the value of education within the community.  Although young people are being pushed out of school, there are a number of other factors involved in early school leaving.  For example, young people might not like school, they are being bullied, they feel silly about not having literacy skills or they are not in a comfortable space, in the sense that other young people are leaving them out.  Another factor is their culture is not seen in the classroom or school.  These factors were even evident when I was going to school in the 1980s.  They are intergenerational issues which continue the cycle.<\/p> <p>  If people want to see something being done, the Yellow Flag programme is an example of an initiative, but we need to see a strong policy approach being taken to address the underlying issues.

One of the challenges we face as we seek to get people to engage with education generally is that some people do not see education as having any benefit for themselves.  We all know people who ask what the point of learning Irish or Latin is, because nobody speaks those languages.  They do not see the point of learning all sorts of things.  Other people believe that all education is good because they see results around them in their own communities.  It seems to me that we keep coming around with this circular challenge.  Our failure to get people from the Traveller community into professions, because of all the barriers we have placed in their way, is creating a challenge for the next generation.  If people are able to look up to a level of previous success when they see members of their own families who managed to get through the education system and do well out of it, they will see that they can get the advantages from education that the rest of society can get from it.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention a classic example that really brought this home to me.  Some of those present will know Dr. Miche&aacute;l MacGr&eacute;il, who did a huge sociological study that included a chapter on the status of Irish-language speakers in society, as opposed to the status of the Irish language.  It also included a chapter on the status of Travellers in society.  Unfortunately, Travellers were at the very lowest level in terms of the way the rest of society perceived them and Irish speakers were right up at the top.  I remind those who might respond to this finding by saying \"that is the way it is\" that 100 or 150 years ago, Irish speakers were out on the margins - where the language survived - as poor fishermen and farmers with the poorest land.  When I started to think about this matter, it struck me that this change was brought about by various forms of State support.  It is interesting to recall that because the new State wanted Irish-language teachers, it put many people from very disadvantaged backgrounds through the training colleges because they had the one thing the State was looking for - the Irish language.  As a result, everyone in these communities had a relative who became a teacher.  Many of them moved into other things.  I started to think about social engineering as I looked at Dr. MacGr&eacute;il's sociological study and reflected on how these groups have diverged over 120 years.  I remind the committee that his study is dedicated to the Traveller community and refers to apartheid in Ireland.  When he talks about apartheid, he is not talking about Travellers - he is talking about the settled community's attitude to Travellers.  We will have a huge challenge when we reach the next module, which relates to employment.  None of us wants to do things from which there are no results.  When people train for football teams, they want to win matches.  When people do things, they want to see results.  One of the challenges we face is that when Travellers get education, they find it more difficult than settled people to get employment.  This means the results of education are not as immediately obvious.<\/p><p>Leaving the Traveller Community aside, I look across at communities that may have 70% going to third level education and other communities that have 20% going to third level education.  One asks why that is so given that they have teachers with the same qualifications and so on.  It seems to come back to the expectation issue.  For example, in some rural communities very few of the parents went to third level education even though some other relatives may have.  They still seem to get an extraordinarily high level of participation.  Many people living very far away from the third level institutions go to third level education while some people in areas close to the M50 get low levels of participation.  Here we get into issues of expectation and peer pressure from other students.  In one the peer pressure seems to be to get on in school as that is the way forward.  We might not have given sufficient attention to addressing this major challenge.<\/p><p> How can we create the expectation within the education system that people can reach for the stars and get there?  In reality they can become doctors, teachers, top scientist or anything else they want to be.  There should be no psychological barrier to getting there, but it seems to be there if we look at this realistically.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#P00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>Perhaps the witnesses might respond to those questions about social engineering and expectations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#Q00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was speaking, I was reminded of how it becomes a kind of self-fulfilling prophesy.  This culture of low expectations has to a degree been internalised certainly by a significant number of Travellers who feel not good enough, that education is not for them, or that they cannot become a garda or a doctor.  That is gradually eroding thankfully.  Much of that low expectation of oneself has been internalised, which is not totally surprising after decades if not centuries of oppression and negative messaging, sometimes in very explicit ways and sometimes in very implicit ways that someone is not good enough.  When picking up that message from cradle to grave, some people internalise it.  It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy and it becomes intergenerational with people passing it on to their children leading to a vicious cycle.  The challenge is breaking that culture of low expectation within the system, in the institutions, in the schools and in the community.<\/p> <p>  The people best placed to break that internalised inferiority complex are Traveller organisations.  We do a lot of work on cultural identity, self-esteem and confidence.  However, we need the funding and resources to do that important work, to instil pride, confidence and a sense of belief that they can accomplish.  We have seen it with other ethnic groups in other parts of the globe.  I travel quite a bit in Europe.

This case study might give some depth to that.  It is a follow-on to the Deputy's question and to what Mr. Collins said.  I will quote from a16 year old in post primary school in 2009:<\/p><blockquote>I love music and art.  I want to be a musician and a model.  I'm really scared to tell my class that I'm a Traveller and have anxiety about this.  Most of my class have said that they are already racist and that their parents do not like us Travellers living in their area.  Some of my class call us &quot;knackers&quot; and most of the rest nod in agreement.  I am the only Traveller in the class, but I don't want to tell my teacher as it could make the situation worse.<\/blockquote><p>That is a case study and many Travellers do not feel that they can disclose their identity.  They do not feel confident because of the level of prejudice and discrimination they experience.  When they are in a classroom where racism comes in from the community and they are surrounded by that, how are they to have that pride in their identity?  It is very challenging.  That is one in a third level institution.  There is another one probably from a primary school.  It is also important.  It is from a seven year old who says that she cannot be herself in school.

We are in a more regressive position now than we were when the visiting teacher service was in place and when there were links with the schools and the parents.  There was an increase in children transferring over to post-primary education and it went up to 90% or 95%.  When the cuts came in they cut the specific educational supports directly to Travellers, which was criminal.  It was morally wrong to do that at a time Travellers were starting to catch up.  It shows that the most marginalised and most excluded groups were the most affected by the cuts.<\/p><p>Travellers were particularly impacted when the social inclusion budget was cut and we have not yet got back to where we were more than 15 years ago.  Going back further, 20 years ago and more, I can personally attest that there were many Travellers in segregated schools.  It is good that they are no longer <i>in situ<\/i>, because they reflected a dark past in terms of how society treated Travellers.  Those institutional schools did not offer the intermediate or leaving certificate and there was no expectation that Traveller children would go further and do better things.  That issue probably deserves a hearing in its own right in terms of how Travellers were treated by the State.<br\/><br\/>The pilot programmes are a welcome new initiative.  The idea is that they will be very much based within the community, as part of which a number of Travellers will be employed and will link in with some of the education bodies.  They will look at issues like skills attainment and some of the challenges Traveller children face in schools.  The proposal is for a well resourced model, with a team linking in with Tusla and the Department of Education and Skills.  The initiative is welcome, but we have yet to see how it will be fully rolled out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1574121600,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>The departmental officials who are responsible for the initiative are due to attend a future meeting of the committee, which will afford us an opportunity to discuss it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2019111900002#S00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1574121600,"counter":1016,"content":"<p>That would be helpful.

I was one of the children who was supported 15 years ago to progress to higher education.  Five years before that, there was more of a barrier in place.  When I was going through the system, there were structures in place which, although not perfect, were well funded.  We had centres, teachers and teaching hours set aside for this purpose.  The resources could have been better deployed but at least they were in place.  Since the cuts were imposed, there has been no sustainable engagement with our community.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about what it is possible to achieve.  We have seen a shift in a generation from a situation where Irish speakers were isolated and segregated to a position where sustained structural and societal support from the State has seen that situation flipped.  The same is possible for Travellers, but the will must be there and there must be a recognition of the value of our community and its contribution.  The new legislation could potentially be very powerful if it helps people to begin to understand what we have contributed to this society via music, crafts, language and our understanding of oral traditions.  If people understood that, they would have a better sense of where we are and why we are here.  However, that is only one step in the process.  There must be restoration to address the horrendous cuts that were made and more programmes must be put in place.  We need not only to devise an educational strategy but to ensure that it is implemented, audited and surveyed.  There must be accountability.  The only people experiencing the consequences of the lack of accountability and engagement are Travellers themselves.  We are talking about people who are very much isolated in society and at the heel of the foot of many people.  The State has a responsibility to intervene now.

There is no doubt in my mind that there are structures in place which are very hostile to Travellers for being Travellers.<\/p> <p>  Two things that were helpful in the past were the visiting teacher service and the provision of additional resources.  One of the changes that is required is that it should be teachers from our community doing the teaching.  The reduction in resources that we have described has caused significant damage because it removed linkages that were there with people who may not have been involved in the traditional structures and wanted to maintain some degree of nomadism while also valuing and wanting to pursue their educational progression.  We strongly recommend that the visiting teacher service be reinstated in a new form that facilitates nomadism.
