The purpose of this meeting is to discuss accelerating offshore wind, including fixed and floating offshore wind generation.  We will discuss the east coast and we are also very interested in the larger opportunity off the south and west coasts.  We will discuss supply chain and logistical challenges.  There is also the issue of green hydrogen and development of a green hydrogen economy.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Peter Coyle, chairman of the Marine Renewables Industry Association, MRIA.  I thank him for coming before the committee to discuss this very important topic.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read out the note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity outside the Houses by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction I give.  For witnesses attending from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present on the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind Members that they are allowed to participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In that regard, I ask all Members joining us online to confirm, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I can see a number of members joining us online from their offices.<\/p> <p>  This part of our meeting will conclude at 11 a.m.  I invite Mr. Coyle to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#A00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here this morning.  Presumably the clerk circulated a statement from me.  I am not going to read it out to the members; they would die of boredom at my droning voice.  I will just pick out the highlights.  The Marine Renewables Industry Association represents people across the island engaged in offshore renewable energy, including ten wind developers.  We have lawyers, researchers, manufacturers and so on as well.<\/p> <p>  To provide some context, there are two historic moments.  The first is 22 July 1929, the day the Ardnacrusha scheme opened in County Clare.  It was an extraordinary step forward for the new State and underpinned the economic development of the State in many respects for the following 50 years or so.  It was built with a capacity of 86 MW, which would be enough to light up Dundalk and Drogheda on a nice day in today's terms, but which exceeded national demand for electricity at the time.  In the early 1930s, we saw the start of the industrialisation policy, which took place during the Great Depression behind tariff barriers, quotas and so forth.  Ardnacrusha underpinned that policy and our economic life, such as it was, throughout the 1940s and 1950s.  It helped to create a body of managerial expertise and industrial skills that enabled us to go on to the next stage of development in the early 1970s when we joined the EU.<\/p> <p>  The second historic moment was 23 December last with the passage into law of the Maritime Area Planning Bill.  It is a monumental body of work and a great tribute to the legislators, policymakers, lawyers and those in industry who contributed to its creation.  Just two years ago, we really had nothing on the Statute Book or in policy in respect of any form of development at sea.  We were dealing with the Foreshore Act of 1933.  In practice, if one looks back at the Oireachtas debates of the time, it was all about dealing with fishing rights around large estates.  In the past two years, Ireland has put together a tapestry of legislation and policy which enables us to develop our offshore renewables, among other things.<\/p> <p>  Why should we develop our offshore renewable energy?  It is an extraordinary resource; we have Europe's most bountiful and available winds and the most bountiful waves in the world also.  Wave technology will come on stream in the 2030s.  The first reason to develop it is our enormous energy insecurity.  We are rated by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, as the fourth most insecure country in Europe.<\/p><p>We have had a very calm couple of years, which has meant the lights have been kept on most of the time.  More than half the load has been borne by the coal plant in Moneypoint in County Clare and by gas.  That coal comes from Russia and, to be blunt about it, there are not that many alternative sources of coal any more.  Currently, the contract is with Russia and Moneypoint continues to be absolutely critical to keeping the lights on.  The other big contributor has been gas, with half of our gas being imported, some of it from Russia.  By 2030, according to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, 90% of our gas will be imported.  We will be in an abject position by then unless we deal with our renewable resource.  That is before we even get to issues like EU targets and all the rest of it.<\/p><p> The immediate and most obvious challenge for our industry is to put in place the minimum of 5 GW of offshore energy that is called for by Government policy.  To put that in perspective, we have less than 5 GW of wind and everything else, including bits and pieces of solar energy and so on, on land at this time.  It is an enormous task and eight years is like two and a half weeks in energy terms.  These projects take a long time to plan, get permission, be built and all the rest of it.  The big challenge for us and for everyone else is to get that up and running.  For the Government, it is a question of getting the new machine in order, including the legislation, all of the policies and the new maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, which is due to open in Wexford in the first quarter of 2023 and will, we hope, be a great new addition to public life.  The next call in this area for the Houses of the Oireachtas will be marine protected areas.  That legislation is somewhere in the works and will be critically important to finding a way of having a harmonious and constructive relationship between the exploitation of our offshore resources and the preservation of our offshore environment.<\/p><p> As I am conscious of running out of time, I will briefly mention four strategic issues.  First, it is vital that our coastal communities are engaged in all of this.  There is provision to safeguard their interests under the new Maritime Area Planning Act.  There are community benefits that will, for many years, bestow millions of euro per annum on relatively small communities for community projects.  Nonetheless, we need to do more to ensure they are involved in, understand and are engaged with planning the offshore future of their communities.  There is a model of coastal partnerships in the UK that is working well.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has talked about setting up experimental partnerships here, possibly in Wexford and Donegal.  I certainly urge the Oireachtas to support the Department in this and prompt it to do so as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Second, we now have a vibrant offshore renewable energy policy, which is first-class and on which a lot of work continues to be done in refining and developing it.  It is not yet matched, however, on the part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which needs to develop a very high level of determination to build a global supply chain in this area.  This will not happen between now and 2030 in the case of the stuff that is primarily going into the water, namely, bottom-fixed wind, principally on the Irish Sea, because that is ubiquitous technology and the home of most of the enormous jobs and income that were created as a consequence of that technology is Denmark, which has some 23,000 people employed in this area.  That is done and dusted in many respects.  We will, of course, have installation jobs and operations and maintenance jobs but most of our resource in the Celtic Sea and off the west coast will have to be exploited by floating wind and by wave.  There are no established players, nationally or internationally, in that field at the present time.  As a consequence, there is an enormous opportunity there.  The Department needs to get involved and engaged and must drive its renowned agencies, namely, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, in which I had the privilege of serving for many years, to develop a policy to exploit that opportunity.<\/p><p> Third, we need to find a way in, in all our forthcoming provisions for offshore renewable energy, for floating offshore wind.  One of the reasons this is necessary is the industrial opportunity it presents in terms of the jobs and incomes that could be created for communities to which it traditionally has been difficult to attract investment, such as Arklow, Wicklow, Wexford and Bantry.  I spent much of my life trying to attract investment to those towns and, for reasons that somewhat escaped me, it never really happened.  It really could happen now if we get our act together.  It must be done not only for industrial purposes but also for the purpose of ensuring our offshore resource is properly exploited.  We need to find a way into our various support schemes for floating offshore wind.<\/p><p> Fourth, we need our legislative leaders to be at the forefront in this effort, alongside industry and officials, who are playing a blinder in this whole area and really are doing an extraordinary job in the difficult circumstances the Covid crisis has imposed on us.  We need members of this committee involved in explaining and communicating the changes that are going to come offshore for our coastal communities.  These changes will include, for example, the issue of port capacity.  We do not have the port capacity nor does anywhere else nearby really have that capacity because they have ambitions of their own, including in Wales, the south west of England, the west of France and the north of Spain.  We do not have the port capacity to work at scale in this area.  We will get by with what we have, plus some investments that are in the pipeline, particularly in Cork, to get to the 5 GW target, but the 30 GW target, which is the Government's aspiration for the 2030s, and the great dreams we have of developing offshore green hydrogen plants and so on can only be realised if we invest in ports.<\/p><p> Finally, I want to give the committee an example of the vision that is now surrounding this industry and which we need to continue on from the work that is being done on the Maritime Area Planning Act and other policy instruments.  The Danish coalition Government decided in June last year or the previous year to invest half of the &euro;35 billion required to build a new island 80 miles west of Jutland in the North Sea.  It is a true island that will have a harbour, people living there and a huge substation that will help to ensure an efficient distribution of electricity from the wind farms in the middle of the North Sea to surrounding countries.  We need that kind of vision and imagination for Ireland for the 2030s.  We could not only be self-sufficient in energy from our own offshore resources but we also could export electricity through interconnectors and have many beneficial developments such as islands out in the Atlantic and off the Celtic Sea.  The consequences in terms of income and job creation in this very labour-intensive industry are extraordinary.  I commend offshore renewable energy to the committee and apologise for talking for so long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coyle for his very interesting statement.  I am very happy that he framed it around Ardnacrusha and the really brave gamble the State took 100 years ago, a gamble that ultimately paid off.  It was a serious vision and a huge step for the State to take.  We are at a similar point now, when we can take steps as big as that.  I know Ardnacrusha very well as it is only up the river from my home city of Limerick.  I used to row up the tail race right up to Ardnacrusha.  I know it intimately and my grand-uncle worked on its construction.  Mr. Coyle is right to frame the challenge we now have around the success and achievement we had 100 years ago.<\/p><p>Speaking to that bigger challenge we now face, I am very mindful of the conflict happening on the other side of Europe.  When we set out these sessions, we were very much thinking of the climate crisis but now, of course, we have a security emergency and energy crisis as well.  It is timely if not coincidental that we are having these sessions now.  They are very relevant to the discussion that is happening across Europe at the moment.  There was a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning by Dr. Hannah Daly, Dr. Paul Deane, Dr. Diarmuid Torney and others in which they talk about Ireland not only providing its own energy needs from its offshore resource but also contributing significantly to Europe's needs.  That is the vision we must have and it is one we can achieve.  Depending on who one talks to, there is a possibility of harnessing something like 50 GW to 70 GW, maybe more if we take into account the wave resource.  I am interested in Mr. Coyle's thoughts on wave energy.  I ask that he elaborate on the bigger vision and the industry's view on how that can be accelerated and expedited, accepting that the 5 GW target is a huge challenge as it is.<\/p><p> Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are going to appear before us in the next hour.  This is an opportunity for Mr. Coyle to tell us what we should relay to them if we are to pursue and achieve that bigger vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#B00200","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Far be it from me to criticise the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as I effectively worked for it for 35 years, but I will take the last issue first.  To some extent, we are a victim of the siloed aspect of Irish government, in that Departments are tribes in their own right.  To put it crudely, they are interested in their own territories and are not very interested in other people's territories.  This reflects the fact, which is an issue for another day, that there has been no fundamental examination of the public service since 1969 with the Devlin report.  It must be the only institution in the world that has not been examined in more than 50 years.<\/p> <p>  Some of the mechanisms that are being put in place behind the scenes, which to non-bureaucrats appear to be unwieldy and bureaucratic, are designed to get over that silo effect and improve communications.  There is no ill will between these people.  It is just that this matter does not feature as much on that Department's radar as it does on that of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I do not mean this to appear critical, but the latter has sucked in a great deal of the talent in the public service in recent times because of this very important issue, which is extraordinarily complex to address.<\/p> <p>  We have the two most renowned agencies in the development agency world in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  I have worked for both of them, so I am biased, but they are world renowned and the best in the business.  If they are given a political direction and a Civil Service direction to go big and have ambitions in this area, they can achieve great things.  They will not be able to do anything in the short term about bottom-fixed offshore wind energy, though, because it is an established industry.  It did not exist 22 years ago.  The first offshore wind farm was built in Denmark in 2000.  The second in the world was Arklow with its little 25 MW, which opened in 2004.  We did not take up that opportunity, though.  I am one of those who was responsible for not taking it up because, unusually and uncharacteristically, we in the IDA scoffed at offshore wind energy in the 1980s and, in particular, 1990s.<\/p> <p>  There are some excellent pioneers in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland working on this area, but I do not believe that the organisations have been given a vision or a demanding goal of making Ireland a global player in the provision of parts, services and so forth &ndash; it does not have to be full-scale rigs &ndash; in floating wind energy and wave energy going forward.<\/p> <p>  I will speak to a point that the Chairman did not mention, although he used the word in a different context, that being, security.  As an industry, we made strong representations to the Commission on the Defence Forces.  They are published on our website as well as the commission's.  Our offshore world has changed and we are going to become dependent on it for our domestic security and exports.  We need proper security provision.  The commission recommended the drawing up of a maritime security plan.  We back that and want to be involved in it.  There is ample scope for bad actors, not so much to damage particular turbines, given that we can remove and replace them, but to damage the big wire that goes ashore and the substation that pulls all of the wires together and steps up or steps down &ndash; I can never remember which it is &ndash; the voltage.  A substation is as complex as an oil rig.  It takes years to build and is not bought out of a box.  In many instances, a substation costs hundreds of millions of euro.  The cable that runs from the substation to the shore is extraordinarily expensive.  There are back orders of approximately two years, it is complex to lay, etc.  The Naval Service would not necessarily need to be significantly involved, but it needs to be given a clear mandate to make it responsible for pulling together the maritime security plan whenever that is drawn up, which I hope it will be urgently, and dealing with any contingency that might arise as regards the substations and the cables going ashore.  This needs to be done urgently because we will have 5 GW in the sea in eight years' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I must be mindful of the time.

They provide us with world-class test facilities for devices and help ports to test out their new facilities and arrangements.  They are probably the leading facilities in Europe.  We have expertise in underwater unmanned vehicles in Limerick.  There is expertise in Galway and Maynooth and considerable expertise in Belfast.  I happen to be fortunate enough to chair the Bryden Centre in Queen's University Belfast.  The centre is a leading light, particularly on the wave energy side.  There are facilities at Strangford Lough.  We have a major intellectual advantage.  We have many people who are good in this area, we have many facilities, we have resources and we have an opportunity.  There is a great deal happening, but we need to pull it all together and match it with a large industrial development opportunity.

Does Mr. Coyle have concerns about our ambition, planning and progress in terms of developing our grid?  Does he believe that we will have the grid infrastructure we require when we need it in order to fulfil our renewable energy potential?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coyle mentioned marine protected areas and how it is important to get the balance right between preserving and enhancing our environment while promoting harmony with other stakeholders.  Given that the planning legislation is progressing much more quickly than the legislation on marine protected areas, are there challenges in getting the balance right if marine protected area legislation is not in place?  How will the industry ensure that the goal of protecting and enhancing the environment is undertaken at the appropriate time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#C00600","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will take the latter question first.  As I understand the matter, there is marine protected area, MPA, legislation in the works.  I do not know what it contains, but bear in mind that there is an extraordinary ambition as regards marine protected areas.  At the moment, 2.5%, or a little less, of our huge maritime area is designated as an MPA in one fashion or another.  The ambition is to increase that to 10% by 2025 and 30% by 2030.  This is a huge issue.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal of expertise and experience in this area.  Generally speaking, the relationships between this industry and the various experts in the field, such as the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, BirdWatch Ireland and others, are good and open.  They are experts and bearers of a great deal of scientific knowledge in this field.  As long as we talk to one another and there are reasonable structures, legislation and so on in place on both sides of the picture, we will find ways and means of getting along.  There will be individuals who object, of course.<\/p><p>There will be concerns in various areas but generally speaking, the MPA bodies, the NGOs and experts in this field, are positive and constructive and are trying to find solutions as we are.  There is good experience.  Let me give one instance.  At our annual forum, which is a big get-together, held a couple of weeks ago we looked at scientific research in Scotland, which was looking at what happens to seals.  The research was monitoring seals in an area in the Pentland Firth in the north of Scotland with underwater blades rotating under a tidal machine.  We do not have a tidal resource in the Republic; there is one in Northern Ireland.  There were no instances of collision between a seal and this underwater blade.  Similar experiences are being shown in regard to birds for example with offshore wind farms.  We are optimistic that wildlife has some sort of learning capability to stay away although there is still a road to be covered.<\/p><p> On the issue of grid, everything in this area is happening at warp speed by the standards of an extremely capital intensive and technically complex industry.  I am not an engineer but it is truly complex stuff.  Putting new grid in place takes time.  We believe there is more grid available than the 5 GW available to the offshore industry identified by EirGrid.  In various submissions we and other organisations advocate a fresh look at that situation.  In the longer term, grid is one of the most challenging areas for us to exploit our resource.  There are many ways forward in the 2030s, called non-grid off-takes, where you do not need grid.  You do not necessarily need grid to make hydrogen to, for example, make ammonia.  You could actually have a hydrogen plant offshore alongside a wind farm and just pump the hydrogen ashore.  Overall we need much more grid.  We are fortunate in having an excellent and responsive body in EirGrid.  While we of course have our rows and arguments with EirGrid, it is a terrific body by and large.  We are optimistic that we can find solutions but it is a challenge.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I offer my congratulations to Mr. Coyle, who has long been an advocate for this concept.  People are perhaps slow learners, catching up with him in his vision for this sector.  Given his experience in the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to what extent is this concept on their agenda?  He talks of a political direction but from my relatively long experience in that Department, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are regarded as the most professional and well-informed in identifying sectors where Ireland can become very competitive in the long term.  Political decisions did not lead to electronics, biopharma or some of these major sectors.  To what extent have the IDA and Enterprise Ireland developed their internal familiarity and thinking about the sector in order that they could sustain the case that this is not only a key opportunity in energy terms but also in industrial policy terms?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the national development plan, NDP, as recently revised, which represents &euro;140 billion investment over six or seven years, in Mr. Coyle's view, how would that need to change?  There is intense competition for resources between the climate challenge, retrofit and all the other issues, as well as the existing ambitions on the wind and offshore front, compared with education and hospitals.  On this issue of making room in the investment programme, in his view how much more room needs to be found to do the sort of things he has identified?  The Danes have done these things by state-led investment.  At what point does he see a floating wind segment in an auction?  The State is right to proceed by way of auction in order that every technology gets a chance to compete.  However it recognises that some sectors need a lead time.  While segmented pieces for floating wind is an acceptable proposal, how soon does he think that ought to be considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#D00200","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>To answer the last question first, there will be an auction of support because bottom-fixed wind even cannot compete with traditional forms of energy generation.  It is normal to provide support, which ultimately is paid for by the consumer through the public service obligation.  There will be one auction of support next year which will deal with the initial batch of projects which will be bottom fixed in the Irish Sea.  Floating offshore wind will not feature in that.  There will be a second auction, probably around 2025, and that conceivably is the last auction that will be held that can actually bring projects on board before 2030 which is vital.  Our view is that floating has to be incorporated in that second option.  Floating is vital to achieving the 5 GW target.  Much of the available grid for example is off the Dublin and Wicklow coasts.  It will be challenging to concentrate so much development there.  Another driver in this is the EU state aids approval, which only extends until the end of 2025.  Floating has to be involved in the second offshore renewable energy support scheme auction, ORESS 2, or it will not feature until well into the 2030s and we will not achieve our 5 GW by the 2030 target.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the question on the NDP, I am not particularly an expert on the NDP.  I would suggest that we have gone off the boil in regard to providing support for early stage developers in wave and tidal, in the new technologies generally.  There currently is not an appropriate grant scheme to help them along.  It is worth bearing in mind that of the 250 or so small companies in wave and tidal in the world, more than half are in Europe.  More than half the patents are held in Europe.  The European Commission has now set a target of 100 MW to be wave and tidal by 2025 and 1 GW, which is huge in terms of a new technology, by 2030.  We need to put money into supporting small Irish companies.  There are some excellent small Irish companies in existence.  A modest modification in respect of the NDP in that regard is called for, as is anything that can be done to gear up grid for domestic purposes.  We have to bear in mind the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications forecast for an increase in local electricity demand of 50% by 2030.  We have a huge growth envisaged in our domestic market but there are also opportunities for export and such things as hydrogen creation.  <\/p> <p>  In regard to how the IDA and Enterprise Ireland are gearing up, I am more familiar in recent years with Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has some excellent people now working on this, who have been working away for years.  It has a new department that will involve this area but I do not think it is where it ought to be.  I suspect the IDA is not either.  What is missing is a conviction being communicated to those agencies by their political leaders - I am not particularly talking about the T&aacute;naiste, I am not tying this into personalities - and by their Civil Service masters, particularly in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, communicating a vision or demand that we grow in this space.  The agencies have the ability and the people.  They can attract the resources but they need now to be given a remit to grow a big global supply chain particularly in floating wind, wave and tidal, and then they will get on with it.  They are not getting that, I suspect, at present.  Therefore their response is not at the optimal level.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coyle for his interesting presentation.  It is good to see the scale of ambition being talked about again.  Reminding ourselves of Ardnacrusha is a good way to start.  Some of my questions build on Deputy Bruton's.<\/p><p>In Denmark, these new energy islands are a state-led project.  They are approximately 51% state-owned.  We know, for example, that facilities like Ardnacrusha were huge State-led initiatives.  It seems we have a tendency in Ireland to wait or try to create market conditions in the hope the leap forward will emerge when, sometimes, the State perhaps needs to leave the leap forward and then industry will follow around that, which seems to be when we are making the level of change that is needed.  That is certainly what happened with Ardnacrusha.  It seems that countries like Denmark are now taking that same leap.  I would be interested in Mr. Coyle's thoughts around that level of State leadership and ambition so that the State is not simply, for example, facilitating the auctions or market but is, in fact, leading.<\/p><p> With regard to 2025, one of the issues we discussed at our previous session was the idea of a reserved 1 GW for floating wind.  Is there potential in that regard?  Again, it is an option of support - it does not have to be deliverable - to bring that forward from 2025.  We might look at that in the next round to consider a reservation and any way floating wind might be part of that earlier than 2025.<\/p><p> I would appreciate it if Mr. Coyle could also expand on the macroeconomic circumstances in that we may have more flexibility within the EU rules before 2025 than after 2025.  I am also very conscious that more fiscal rules are being suspended at the moment within the wider area of investment, which may not be indefinite.<\/p><p> I want to ask about the circular economy part of the supply chain, which we have also looked at as a committee.  I am aware of some innovation in UCC, which has been looking at perhaps 11,000 tonnes of waste from the earlier generation of wind turbines.  In a past committee, we also heard from people who were looking at recycled plastic being part of wind blades.  Can we get a sense of how we can engage with the supply chain around wind turbines and that industry?  I have one final point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#D00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I have stop Senator Higgins there.

We have other fish to fry, if members will pardon the expression, between now and then and many things to get done.  It is just an indication of what could happen and what we should be thinking about going forward into the 2030s.<br\/><br\/>I am happy the officials, who, obviously under general political direction, oversee the running of this area, are taking quite a visionary approach to all this.  In my experience in recent years, they are people of considerable ability.  The challenge is they are trying to create in detail a system of governance from nothing in a very short period over a territory that is nine or ten times the size of the terrestrial territory of the State.  It is as if we took the land mass, which is only one tenth of the size of the total territory of the State, and created from scratch laws to do with everything from waste disposal, traffic management, building regulations, health and safety and so on.  That is what they are doing at present.  At the same time, they are trying to ensure we can get stuff in the water and working quickly.  Much vision and drive is taking place at an official level.  We need to start thinking about the 2030s and the 30 GW.  We do not need to do it next week but we need to start thinking about it in the future.<br\/><br\/>On the supply chain and circular economy side of things, it was interesting to watch the dismantling of the Kinsale offshore gas platform recently.  First of all, it was built and served its purpose.  It is now being dismantled.I would guess it cost approximately &euro;100 million to dismantle it.  It is mostly steelwork and it has gone straight back into furnaces to become new steelwork.  The good thing from the State's perspective is that the industry that built it paid the &euro;100 million for its dismantling.  As far as I am aware, the State did not incur any cost.<br\/><br\/>The same approach will apply to offshore wind turbines and wave and tidal turbines.  The State will have to post a bond from the outset, which will ensure it pays for the recycling of a particular device when it runs out of life.  Industry is moving in a recycling direction.  At present, and this comes back to one of my earlier themes, we do not have the local industry that can contribute greatly to the various components etc. that go into an offshore turbine or wave device.  One exception might be &Eacute;ireComposites in County Galway, which makes blades.  It is a very advanced plastics company.<br\/><br\/>To give the Senator an impression of the scale that is achievable given recycling, Siemens is at present building a factory in Le Havre in north-west France just to serve the south North Sea.  It is a half mile long and will employ 700 people.  It has done more or less the same and rebuilt the port of Hull for the northern part of the North Sea.  General Electric, GE, is building a huge plant, again with many jobs, in Teesside and another big one is going into Scotland.  Recycling obviously has to play a part in all this but the economic opportunities are huge.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of marine protected areas, this legislation will be as complex as the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021.  We have wonderful wildlife and an underwater environment and we have many people who are aware of what is out there.  We need to preserve it and ensure it lives well and in harmony with economic development.  I genuinely do not know a great deal beyond that.  A very good piece of work was published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage last year on every aspect of marine protected areas.  There was a big consultation about it.  Our response is up on our website, <i>mria.ie<\/i>.  That will service as the basis for the marine protected area legislation.<br\/><br\/>On the 1 GW, I do not think it is possible to bring the second auction forward from approximately 2024 or 2025.  A huge rigmarole has to be gone through to get there, necessarily and rightly so, under the new legislation.  It is truly complex stuff.  The system is going as far as it can but the requirement is that there is specific provision in that auction for floating wind and, indeed, a small amount of support for wave in particular in order that we can get pilot devices up and working away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coyle for his presentation.  I have a couple of quick questions.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled an Opposition Private Members' Bill that talked about the opportunity of offshore wind and the need for an industrial development authority for the sea.  In Mr. Coyle's experience, is it more a case that the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, and Enterprise Ireland have the capacity but it is about refocusing , repurposing or redirecting them?  Do we need a new agency?  Do we already have the agencies to deliver this?  Is it about directing them?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the focus and co-ordination and the issue of capacity.  In Mr. Coyle's experience of the agencies he has dealt with but also in terms of the Civil Service and Departments, is the capacity there at this stage?  Is there a shortfall in that regard?  Co-ordination came up at our previous hearing on Thursday in response to a question from the Chairman.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste in the D&aacute;il reference a cross-government task force on offshore wind.  Is Mr. Coyle aware of that?  How would he like to see it take shape?<\/p><p>Should it just be for offshore wind or should it be expanded, and who should be involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#E00600","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>An IDA for the sea is an attractive proposition on the face of it, but setting up public agencies is time-consuming and expensive.  One has to go through extensive turf wars that go on forever and a good outcome cannot be guaranteed.  The agencies we have, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are superb.  It is just a matter of handing them the vision and the demand to do big things and be imaginative in this area.  By the way, a very important agency that is about to be created in the first quarter of 2023, preferably in January 2023, is the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, in Wexford.  Its smooth and effective functioning is going to be very important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of capacity, historically there were one and a half men and women, a dog and a blunt pencil assigned to this area.  That has changed radically in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in recent times.  It does not have enough people - we never have enough people in these areas - but I am satisfied that in that Department and in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which also plays a key role in this area, there are probably adequate numbers of people involved.<\/p> <p>  There is a concern across the industry that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is going to be the planning authority for a significant portion of the European Union's waters, and the planning is going to be very complex, has the number of people and the expertise available to it into the future.  There is real concern there.  We want to ensure that MARA gets up and running with extensive resources from the outset.  There was a good sign recently when I heard that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage apparently has rented a new block which is being built as part of a larger development on the waterfront in Wexford.  That is a good sign the Department is taking this seriously and putting resources into it.  MARA must be resourced.  Those are the two key issues - make sure MARA gets up and running quickly and that it is well resourced and make sure An Bord Plean&aacute;la is well resourced.  Of course, there are people in the background we have to think about as well, such as the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which plays a key role in this area.<\/p> <p>  On the Government task force, there was an effort in this area to get Departments to pull and work together in the past.  It did not really work.  However, the involvement of the Department of the Taoiseach in ensuring the legislation was put together quickly seems to have carried on.  I have heard about the cross-government task force and I am fully in favour of it.  It is important that people in the silos are pulled together and talk together.  We should give it a chance and see what happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Coyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Mr. Coyle is very welcome.

It is shallow and therefore lends itself to the technology that is available today, kind of from Amazon if the committee will excuse the expression, which is bottom-fixed wind.  There is grid available off Dublin and Wicklow and there is a big market in the Dublin-Wicklow area.  It is very important that we get the first offshore renewable energy support scheme auction away.  It will focus on projects that are quite well-advanced in terms of their planning off the east coast.  If that gets held up or hindered in any way, we will have problems achieving targets in the 2030s and we will lose credibility in the huge investment world that now surrounds offshore renewable energy.  Bear in mind that while 5 GW is enormous for us, it is fairly Mickey Mouse for other people.  Scotland has just approved 24 GW of offshore wind, of which 60% is floating.  Wales has a 4 GW target of floating alone.  This is business for big companies and big developers with big pockets and big credibility in the investment world.<\/p> <p>  The east coast is vital.  I live in the Deputy's constituency.  I can see a bit of the sea from my attic window.  I am conscious of the types of issues and objections that may arise about visual impact.  The developers who are candidates to build these farms off the east coast, particularly off Dublin and Wicklow, are putting a great deal of effort into community support.  There are all sorts of protections under the Maritime Area Planning Act to ensure people have a real say.  They might not think they have a real say, but they do.  There are considerable benefits that will arise for the community.  To take D&uacute;n Laoghaire alone, for argument's sake to illustrate the point, the community benefit provisions that are being made by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are such that just one wind farm off D&uacute;n Laoghaire would probably pour &euro;4 million per year for approximately 25 years into that community for community projects.  That is over and above normal Government expenditure, and there will be all sorts of safeguards to ensure that it is not a substitute.  There are those aspects.<\/p> <p>  I throw the issue back to the Deputy.  The challenge for him and other coastal Deputies, Senators and leaders around Dublin and Wicklow, because those are communities that will be particularly affected, although not exclusively, is that they must show leadership in this area.  They have to try to get communities to understand that we need to do this or the lights will go off.  We cannot continue depending on Russian gas and coal to keep our lights on.  It is absurd.  As a country which has the oil of the offshore wind and wave world - we are like Saudi Arabia or, as the late Brendan Halligan used to say, we are Europe's battery - we cannot mess it up.  However, it will require not just people like me and others in industry but also political leaders to get out in front of this and deal with the objections and issues that will arise.  That is not always going to be easy to do.

I am joined by Mr. Christal and Mr. Curran of Enterprise Ireland, while Dr. Alan Power is joining the meeting online.  Dr. Power is also part of the secretariat to the expert group on future skills needs.<\/p> <p>  Wind energy will be critical in enabling our transition to a low-carbon economy.  Meeting our national climate targets will require a significant increase in the deployment rates of renewable electricity, including offshore wind, compared with those achieved in recent years.  The development of offshore wind energy will bring significant economic and employment opportunities to Ireland.  The Department and its development agencies are active in further developing these supply chain activities.  I will briefly address three of these activities relevant to the deliberations of the committee.  These are: Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities in developing SME capability in offshore wind supply chains; research by the expert group on future skills needs to identify the future skills requirements for the offshore wind sector; and regional developments, including the regional enterprise plans and the Shannon Estuary economic task force.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been working with SMEs to develop their capability in the offshore wind sector.  It has developed an offshore wind supply chain cluster of 65 companies.  These companies provide a range of products, services and skill sets appropriate to the offshore wind industry.  As per its remit, Enterprise Ireland is primarily focused on helping Irish SMEs bring this capability to export markets.  By far the largest and easiest to access market opportunity is the UK.  The London office of Enterprise Ireland has been building connections between Irish SMEs and UK offshore wind project developers, original equipment manufacturers and tier 1 contractors to ensure the greatest possible penetration of the UK market.  By facilitating Irish SMEs entering the UK offshore wind industry, Enterprise Ireland is helping these companies to build the appropriate capability and offerings to industry that not only operate in the UK and globally, but are also going to be major stakeholders in the Irish offshore wind sector.  Securing reference sites in Ireland will be advantageous for these supply chains as these companies seek to win business internationally.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland has organised several sector events in the past three years in the UK, including a market study visit to Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth on the east coast of England, an event to showcase Irish capability to Dutch tier 1 contractors and a showcase of Irish capability to the Norwegian energy company Equinor.  It also commissioned a scoping study for Irish SMEs, focusing on supply chain opportunities in the UK, Denmark and Norway.  Enterprise Ireland is currently planning an industry forum to be held in Croke Park in June to focus on export market opportunities, particularly in the UK market, as well as opportunities for the supply chain domestically.<\/p><p>A further event in Manchester is planned in late June, where EI will take the Irish pavilion to Global Offshore Wind, an industry trade show.<\/p><p> From a skills policy and employment perspective, the Department is committed to identifying and driving the delivery of skills required to deliver on the ambitious wind energy targets.  The expert group on future skills needs, the secretariat of which sits in our Department, has published its study on skills to enable the low-carbon economy to 2030.  As part of this study, the expert group examined the skills needs arising from offshore wind energy generation targets in the 2019 climate action plan.  It estimated the demand for labour associated with offshore wind development will increase from the low hundreds to 2,500 mid-decade and will fluctuate around this level to 2030.  The group's modelling was based on the five phases of offshore wind energy, namely, planning, development, installation and operations through to decommissioning.  Across these phases, the expert group identified a range of skills that are required in engineering, environmental science and humanities, construction and technical services, legal and professional services, transport and logistics, and emerging and niche occupations.  As well as ongoing industry engagement with Ireland's skills development system, the report recommended the establishment of training partnerships or responses for projects between the Government, industry and education and training providers.<\/p><p> The offshore wind industry has significant regional employment and the Department is involved in the development and launch of nine new regional enterprise plans to 2024.  In developing these, the steering committees in each region considered how to contribute to a carbon-neutral economy.  Some of the regional enterprise plans contain specific strategic objectives of relevance to the offshore renewable wind and supply chain.  For example, the mid-west regional enterprise plan aims to harness the potential for major offshore floating wind projects off the west coast and to bring users of renewable energy physically close to the energy source.   The west regional enterprise plan specifically targets the region's potential for enterprise and job creation in the renewable energy sector.  It includes a focus on the potential of green hydrogen in decarbonising industry.  The region will work with large energy users to demonstrate the demand for this form of energy.  The north-west plan targets the growth of the wind energy industry by diversifying its existing onshore wind industry into the offshore wind industry.<\/p><p> The Shannon Estuary task force is being established in response to a commitment in the programme for Government.  Given the Shannon Estuary&rsquo;s deepwater port and geographical position, it is expected to assess the potential for renewable energy projects.  Existing infrastructure such as Shannon Foynes Port and the Tarbert and Moneypoint power stations will be key to harnessing that potential.  Several renewable energy projects that either have been proposed or are in planning illustrate the region's potential to complete its transition to a renewable-based economy, and these are expected to inform the work of the task force.<\/p><p> Achieving the full potential of Ireland's offshore wind resource offers major opportunities for the development of offshore wind electricity and associated by-products such as hydrogen, ammonia, energy storage and transmission technologies and technology services.  Large international investors are engaged with indigenous companies in a range of joint ventures to progress some of these business opportunities.  The Department and its agencies are actively engaged in building capacity in the indigenous sector for these supply chain opportunities.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.

I will provide an overview of the significant progress being made to deliver on this objective.<\/p> <p>  The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 has delivered the legislative basis to enable regulation of Ireland's maritime area outside the 12 nautical mile coastal zone limit for the first time.  This was an important achievement and provides certainty for offshore wind energy projects, which involve substantial levels of upfront investment.  The legislation provides the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications with powers to assess the first batch of maritime area consent, MAC, applications from a set of qualified offshore renewable energy, ORE, developers.  The purpose of this assessment will be to ensure only developers with the necessary financial and technical capability can enter the planning system.  A consultation on the proposed MAC assessment criteria was recently completed and the Minister will shortly announce the date in April when the MAC application window will open for this first batch of applications.  This will be a milestone on the critical path towards delivery on our 2030 targets, boosting international confidence in the State's intent to deliver at pace.<\/p> <p>  These assessments and the awarding of MACs to suitably qualified developers will be completed in quarter 3 of this year.  Developers can then apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for development permission, which will involve a full environmental assessment and public consultation in respect of their proposed projects.  The granting of MACs will also enable the first offshore renewable electricity support scheme auction to open in quarter 4 of 2022, providing a route to market for these projects.  As part of these offshore renewable energy support scheme, ORESS, contracts, significant contributions to community benefit funds, amounting to millions of euros annually, will be required from each project.  The model for the management and distribution of these funds will shortly be finalised, following the completion of a public consultation exercise.<\/p> <p>  Given this first phase of projects alone will not deliver the full 5 GW, a second batch of projects will need to be progressed through the development pipeline.  Again, the overriding objective must be to ensure only the most viable and realistic projects gain entry to the planning system.  The Department currently has a consultation open, setting out a range of potential criteria to identify this pool of projects, including the possible inclusion of an innovation category for non-fixed wind technologies such as floating wind.  In tandem with the work being led by the Department, a range of initiatives are under way in many other Departments and State agencies to support the development of this new sector, some of which members will hear from today.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that work under way in the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the marine environment units of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage be progressed at pace to ensure appropriate data are made available to inform the sustainable development of the offshore wind energy sector while also ensuring national objectives regarding marine biodiversity are attained.  Recognising the range of initiatives under way, the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change recently approved a proposal to establish a delivery task force for offshore wind.  Matt Collins, assistant secretary in the Department, will chair this task force with the aim of ensuring the alignment and co-ordinated delivery of all activities under way among Departments, State agencies and related bodies.<\/p> <p>  Work is also being progressed to establish the building blocks required to enable the full potential of our offshore resource to be realised beyond 2030.  The policy intent is to move to a plan-led regime whereby the State, in consultation with all maritime users, will identify the areas best suited for sustainable renewable energy development.  Work on the second offshore renewable energy development plan is in progress and includes assessment of the opportunities for wind, wave and tidal technologies.  In parallel, work to assess the economic opportunity is being progressed, examining how to connect potential sources of offshore energy with large demand centres in continental Europe.  The planned Greenlink interconnector will provide a 500 MW connection between Ireland and Great Britain, while the Celtic interconnector will provide a 700 MW link between Ireland and the European internal energy market by connecting Ireland to France.  Non-electricity grid-related opportunities, particularly the potential to use excess renewable electricity to generate synthetic e-fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia, are also being assessed.  These fuels can be used to help decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors and the transport sector, especially in the case of heavy goods vehicles, maritime transport and potentially even the aviation sector.<\/p> <p>  In summary, significant work is under way in a range of Departments and State agencies to deliver on our 2030 offshore wind targets and this work remains firmly on track.

I am the principal officer responsible for the ongoing development and implementation of the new maritime planning system, brought about by the Maritime Area Planning Act and the national marine planning framework.<\/p><p>The State has undergone the most comprehensive review and overhaul of marine legislation and governance since its formation.  The two primary pillars of this reform are the national marine planning framework, NMPF, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 1 July 2021, and the Maritime Area Planning Act, which was passed by these Houses and subsequently promulgated by the President on 23 December 2021.<\/p><p> The NMPF is the long-term forward plan for Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area to ensure the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.  It is also intended to support the introduction of offshore renewable energy into our maritime area.  The Maritime Area Planning Act will be the cornerstone of the new marine planning system in Ireland and brings together and creates the legal foundation for forward planning, streamlined development management and enforcement.  All future offshore renewable energy applications will be consented through this Act.  The Act will also establish a new agency, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, the role of which will be to govern the occupation of the maritime area.  With these initiatives, and guided by the NMPF, our maritime planning system will move towards being a plan-led process rather than the developer-led system it currently is.<\/p><p> The NMPF is a parallel document to the national planning framework, NPF.  Both of these spatial plans are concerned with the long-term future of our land and sea area, identifying opportunities for protection, growth and development so that our land and marine areas can be managed in the best interests of the public.  The NPF recognises the importance of integration and co-ordination with the land planning regime at national, regional and local levels.  In future it will be equally important, in turn, that national, regional and local terrestrial plans are consistent with the NMPF, as will be required under the Maritime Area Planning Act.  The Act also provides for designated maritime area plans, DMAPs, which are management plans for a localised area of our sea, to be developed.  Any Minister or relevant public body will be able to bring forward a DMAP proposal for a geographic area or sector which will be subject to public participation, environmental assessment and Oireachtas decision.  Once approved, these DMAPs become part of the NMPF.  This ensures a joined-up approach to marine forward planning with binding considerations for decision-makers.  I fully expect that the enduring offshore renewable energy system will be led and supported by DMAPs and will manoeuvre the system away from a developer-led model and towards a State-led model.  I thank the committee members for their interest and am happy to answer their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor McCabe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Fiona Ralph.  I am a principal officer in the climate unit in the Department of Finance and I deal with national and international climate priorities as well as sustainable financial services.<\/p> <p>  The EU taxonomy for sustainable activities is an extremely important piece of work.  In a nutshell it defines what is sustainable for almost 40% of economic activities that are themselves responsible for up to 80% of our total emissions.  We know that Ireland and the rest of the EU needs to substantially increase sustainable investment over the next decade.  This investment cannot come solely from governments - private investors must also crowd in.  The taxonomy will encourage and guide investors to identify and channel money towards genuinely green investments.  I will comment on the purpose of the taxonomy and its relevance to today&rsquo;s topic before turning to the state of play in its development.<\/p> <p>  The taxonomy is a classification system developed at EU level.  It aims to specify technical, science-based criteria for assessing whether specific economic activities make a substantial positive contribution to climate change while doing no significant harm to the environment and simultaneously meeting minimum safeguards.  The taxonomy will evolve over time with more activities being added.  It will also reflect technological advances.  The Commission&rsquo;s website offers a useful taxonomy compass tool, which can be used to check the requirements sector by sector.  For example, the taxonomy sets out the conditions that a variety of activities related to the renewable energy sector must meet in order to be deemed sustainable, from electricity generation, storage, manufacture, transmission and distribution to solar, wind, geothermal, renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuel and bioenergy.  It is primarily aimed at large companies and the financial services sector to guide and mobilise investments in activities to achieve carbon neutrality. <\/p> <p>  Although it is voluntary for companies to spend or invest in taxonomy-aligned activities, certain companies in scope must report on the extent to which their business is aligned with the taxonomy&rsquo;s standards.  The EU and its member states are also working with other countries to agree a common set of standards that can be applied globally.<\/p> <p>  The taxonomy should be beneficial in a number of ways.  Investors will be better able to identify opportunities and confidently invest in projects and companies that have a substantial positive impact on the climate.  Corporates and financial services firms will improve transparency on sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities due to the taxonomy and other complementary transparency legislation.  These factors should help to shift investments to where they are most needed for the transition to net zero, while helping citizens, corporates and governments to keep an eye on where the money is going.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline the state of play in its development.  The overarching regulation came into force in 2020 and set out six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.  To be considered sustainable, an activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of those six objectives and do no significant harm to the other objectives.  It must also meet minimum social safeguards and comply with technical screening criteria related to the objectives.<\/p> <p>  The detailed requirements for these objectives are set out in a series of delegated Acts, one of which came into force on 1 January 2022 and covers climate mitigation and adaptation.  A complementary Act, covering the requirements for natural gas and nuclear power, was adopted by the Commission on 2 February and, unless rejected by the Council or the European Parliament, will come into force next year. <\/p> <p>  Reporting requirements for firms in scope of the taxonomy are also in force as of this year.  These reporting requirements are complementary to those already existing and under development under some other notable EU legislation, such as the sustainable finance disclosures regulation and the non-financial reporting directive, which is currently being amended to become the corporate sustainability reporting directive.<\/p> <p>  The Commission has indicated that an additional delegated Act, covering the four remaining environmental objectives - water and marine, circular economy, pollution prevention, and biodiversity - is expected later this year.  Consideration is also being given to expanding the taxonomy to cover intermediate, or transitional, environmental performance and social objectives.  <\/p> <p>  In addition, under the European Commission&rsquo;s 2018 action plan on sustainable finance, we are now negotiating a regulation for a European green bond standard that could come into operation in 2024 and aims to set a gold standard for green bonds to raise funds on capital markets.<\/p> <p>  As taxonomy alignment reporting beds in for corporates and becomes increasingly relevant for the public sector, it is reasonable to expect that Ireland&rsquo;s public expenditure should increasingly demonstrate alignment with the taxonomy.  I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022030800002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Owens"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Owens.

While it is not decided yet, the European Council and the European Parliament need to make their decision.  The concern in this committee is that labelling nuclear and gas as green energy in Europe could send a signal that stifles development by diverting attention, opportunity and investment away from Ireland.  We would think there is now an opportunity, especially considering the current security and energy crises, to seek to decarbonise the energy systems in Europe as quickly as possible.  Ireland is well placed in that regard and the concern is that the taxonomy might pull against that opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. McCabe from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage relating to MARA and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A guest who was before the committee prior to this session said that a concern for the industry is that both of those institutions may not have the necessary human resources to deal with the number of applications and the level of opportunity that exists.

Not all of the alternatives are in place.  The timing of divestment from gas and nuclear technology will have to be carefully considered.  The approach of the Government has been to seek to have a slightly higher standard applied on the gas side of taxonomy.  However, we remained agnostic on the nuclear side, given that the Commission had worked hard on trying to find a compromise.  Many member states had different views for different reasons.

Many work streams are ongoing in different Departments, agencies and regulatory bodies.<\/p> <p>  The main job of the delivery task force will be to co-ordinate and pull together all of these aspects.  A key part of that will be to ensure we are able to develop an enterprise and skill-development strategy alongside that and as the projects start to move from planning phases into construction phases and, in turn, into operation and management phases, we will have the skilled people ready to work with those projects and Irish companies available to take part in the construction and ongoing operation and management of the projects.<\/p> <p>  All of this is critical to ensure that projects have more certainty in terms of development.

My central question concerns the degree to which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has taken this on board.  We have a new national development plan and &euro;140 billion.

I might address some of the questions she asked around the State approach.  As I said in my opening statement, the intention is that the work that we are doing on the offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, will inform how best we move forward with the State-led approach.  We want to move from the current project or developer led approach to the State actually identifying the best areas for offshore energy in consultation and using an evidence-based approach and data from many other sectors, including data on the environmental sensitivities.  National parks and wildlife and MPAs are all important, but they are not the only aspects that are being looked at.  It is much broader than that.  Once we complete that national assessment, the OREDP, the intention is that we then identify the best areas to move into the DMAPs that our colleague in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage referenced.  Just to be clear, there are environmental assessments to be carried out at every level of the process.  At a plan level, we are carrying out a strategic environmental assessment, an appropriate assessment.  When we get down through the DMAP, similar exercises will be carried out.  Further down, at a project level, there will be environmental impact assessments and so on.  It is very much a holistic approach that we are taking.  The framework and the legislation which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has established is very much providing the overarching framework within which we are working.  Moving to that State-led approach will offer a lot of advantages for the State, but also for other maritime users.  It will enable the protection of biodiversity and also de-risk the process for developers.  It really is the optimal route, long term.  However, there is work to be done to get there.

I am not sure of the exact percentage, but a significant proportion of carbon tax is not ring-fenced for carbon measures.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The seafood-offshore renewable energy working group was to be set up by 2021 to act as a stakeholder body.  I am wondering whether there is a progress report on that.  There are some concerns that there have been delays with it.  It is fundamental that those discussions are happening between different stakeholders to ensure that we get the right response in answer to our renewable questions.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if any of the witnesses can answer this question, but I am wondering if there are any plans to dial up Ireland's preparedness to harness our natural resources in light of the events in Ukraine.  It has been a very quickly evolving situation.  There is quite a high level of risk that energy security in Europe and Ireland over the short to medium, and perhaps long, term could be impacted.

It is important to note that the Bill took all of our resources.  It was an incredibly complex and difficult piece of legislation to get through.  To tie this back to Deputy Bruton's question around what can be done, I think the legislation and the framework really showed what the State can do when it puts it mind to something.  Right across a number of Departments and the political apparatus, people really got behind the legislation and got it through.  We spent 22 to 24 hours at Committee Stage alone, but everybody had a very similar vision and objective, even though there might have been disagreements around the contents of the Bill.

Will that be the case or is the Department talking about other new projects in the submission rather than these legacy projects?  I am very interested to hear what the Department has to say about moving to a more State-led approach.  When might that happen?  Will it happen on time or will we end up in a position where the developers will lead the development or renewable energy when they choose to invest in something?

When they come before the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in order to apply for a maritime area consent, if they are deemed viable developers in that they have the financial and technical capability, they will give up any foreshore lease they already have in return for being granted a maritime area consent.  That will then give a gateway to the planning system, allowing them go before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The projects would have to be fully assessed from all environmental considerations along with planning.  Public consultation would be part of that.  Essentially, they are moving from the old regime to the new but will still be fully assessed.<\/p> <p>  As we mentioned, there is also an open consultation now on how we might best identify the second batch of projects.  In order to meet the 2030 targets, the projects need a number of years to be developed - it is typically seven or more years - and we must get projects into the pipeline as soon as possible.  That phase 2 consultation is currently open for everyone to contribute, thinking of how we identify the most appropriate projects to move into the new system.  Again, the intention must be to ensure the most viable projects get into the planning system so we do not clog that system with projects that are not realistic.<\/p> <p>  On the question of a State-led approach, we must move forward in order to meet the 2030 targets and get these projects into the development pipeline at the same time as developing and figuring out the best approach to that State-led regime.  We are doing work this year on the offshore renewable energy development plan, looking at opportunities and constraints, and we aim to have that completed by the end of this year or January 2023.  That information will be available and used as part of that second batch of projects progressing through the development pipeline.  To move a fully State-led approach will take a number of years and it is important to acknowledge we are trying to do both in tandem.

The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide the necessary funding for the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme within the energy transformation programme of my Department.<\/p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the impact of the rising cost of living on households, including the rising cost of electricity and gas prices caused by international conditions.  Wholesale natural gas prices have been increasing since the second half of 2020 and current indications are that these higher prices will continue for the foreseeable future.  These higher prices feed directly through to retail electricity prices, as gas is used for electricity generation.<\/p><p>To address the growing impact of rising costs on vulnerable households, the Government increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 in budget 2022.  There were also increases to the qualified child payment and the living alone allowance, and an increase in the income threshold for the working family payment was introduced.  In addition, there were adjustments to basic welfare, pension rates and income tax bands, which were introduced primarily to cater for the cost of living increases driven in part by energy prices.<\/p><p>Since then, however, the continuing rise in the cost of living has further significantly impacted citizens' lives.  Recognising this on 10 February, as part of a suite of policy measures designed to support households, the Government announced an increase in the electricity credit from &euro;100, excluding VAT, to &euro;200, including VAT.  The total cost of this scheme has been set in the relevant legislation at &euro;400 million.  This will allow for the payment of the electricity credit to all domestic electricity customers registered on an agreed date, including pay-as-you go customers, from this April.  Approximately 2.25 million account holders will benefit from the scheme with a one-off exceptional payment to their electricity accounts.<\/p><p>This scheme is part of a range of measures being taken by the Government to mitigate the impact of rising energy costs, including a fuel allowance lump sum payment of &euro;125, a drug payment scheme reduction to &euro;80, a front-loading of the working family payment, a 20% reduction in public transport fees from the end of April until the end of the year, and a reduction in caps for school transport fees.<\/p><p><b><\/b>The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, which provides the legal basis for the scheme, passed all Stages in the Oireachtas on 2 March.  The scheme will be operated by the distribution system operator - ESB Networks - and electricity suppliers and will be overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.<\/p><p>Based on the number of domestic electricity accounts, ESB Networks will make payments to the individual electricity suppliers who will then credit each domestic electricity account held with them.  ESB networks and suppliers will be required to make all books and records relating to their functions under the scheme available to an auditor to be appointed by my Department.<\/p><p> The Revenue Commission has advised that VAT must be applied on the bill balance after the credit has been applied.  On that basis the credit of &euro;176.22 is being applied exclusive of VAT on each account.  Inclusive of VAT, the total reduction on each household electricity costs will be &euro;200. <\/p><p> The total cost of the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme is estimated at &euro;400 million.  The cost of the scheme is being funded by my Department through a reallocation of &euro;128.6 million from subhead B4 &ndash; residential and community retrofit programmes to subhead B11 &ndash; electricity credit, along with additional Exchequer funding of &euro;271.4 million being made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this Supplementary Estimate.<\/p><p> My Department is maintaining the planned delivery outputs for the residential and community retrofit schemes by allocating &euro;267.2 million in capital funding to the programme in 2022.  This is comprised of &euro;184.2 million, including capital carryover, from the Vote and &euro;83 million of funding from the energy efficiency national fund.  This is the highest ever allocation for the programme and will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a building energy rating, BER, of B2.  This nearly doubles the number of homes delivered to B2 standard in 2021.<\/p><p> In the longer term, the best protection from rising prices is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and to improve the efficiency of our homes.  The 2021 climate action plan has set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a BER of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030.  The national retrofit plan, which was published last November, is designed to address barriers to retrofit, identifying a range of measures aimed at driving demand, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain and making retrofits more affordable.<\/p><p> New initiatives launched last month to deliver on this plan include a new national home energy upgrade scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard and a special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation.  These new initiatives will be funded by the national development plan financial allocation for residential retrofit of &euro;8 billion to 2030.  Over 60% of this funding, equalling &euro;5 billion, will be from carbon tax revenue.<\/p><p> Government also recognises that for many homeowners, even with enhanced grant rates, there will be a need to access finance to fund their upgrade.  For this reason, my Department is working with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the Department of Finance, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the European Investment Bank and financial institutions to design a new low-cost loan scheme for retrofit.<\/p><p> I am very happy to take questions from the committee on this Supplementary Estimate, which will provide the necessary funding for the electricity costs emergency benefit scheme payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#A00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Unfortunately, she is also correct when she says that the likely prognosis is for ongoing high energy costs.  We had thought, prior to the invasion and war, that energy prices would start to come down because they were already very high.  That is now less certain.  For the immediate future, this year and probably next year, there will be no relief.  For that reason, the Government is looking to see are there additional measures it can take.  We said clearly that we thought additional measures unnecessary and that we would wait until the budget in October before further reviewing the situation but we will have to act quicker than that.<\/p> <p>  We will not be able to cover the full cost and cushion the full blow.  The price of gas, oil and coal has risen to unprecedented levels.  They may vary slightly.  To take the example of the cost of gas, it will not decrease immediately or significantly because even if there were an immediate resolution of the war, Europe would look to increase gas storage and that would see an ongoing demand.  We will need additional measures.<\/p> <p>  There is another core solution we must consider that might take slightly longer but which must be centre stage, that is, we need additional measures that reduce our use of fossil fuels.  We must look at radically accelerating energy efficiency measures across a whole range of different sectors.  I am working on that in my Departments, as well as working with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and, critically, with the European Commission on its toolbox, which it is going to revise and update in the next two or three days.  A united European approach is best.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the example of the Spanish and Polish price caps, I think every country has different circumstances and I do not believe our circumstances would allow for those mechanisms to work.  Taking Spain as an example, there are many complex reasons its market is particularly exposed because of the way the market is designed and so on.  My understanding is that much of that cap applies to companies that do not have any fossil component but may include a large nuclear-powered generator that has experienced no real cost increase but has benefited from the market price increase.  None of our suppliers are characterised in that way.  All of our main generators are typically using a mix of fuel.  In the case of the ESB, that mix comprises coal and gas and most other suppliers are supplying gas, albeit they also have renewables.  The increase in the price of coal and gas has hit most of the large generators and, therefore, there is not the same extent of supernormal profits that one might see, for example, in the case of a nuclear generator.  We do not have those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#B00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The companies have all shown handsome profits in recent times and that needs to be shared out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#B00400","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>ESB profits are shared out in a variety of ways.  That happens, for example, through dividends to the State.  The ESB has a critical role in the roll-out of new renewable generation, which is how we will reduce our dependence on Russian fossil fuels.  It also has a critical role in the building out of the distribution grid, the smart metering network and the energy efficiency measures that we need to deliver.  ESB has a massive capital programme and its profits in comparison with that are actually very small.  The ESB recently launched a new company strategy with ten core objectives which were hugely ambitious and to the benefit of the Irish people.  Its ability to invest in that plan is critical to our energy security and climate ambition.  It is also crucial in helping to shield householders.  The smart metering programme, for example, would allow us to introduce time-of-day pricing and so on so customers can start saving money by using power when the wind is blowing and energy is cheap rather than at peak times.  We need to strengthen and support ESB's ability to invest.  Most of the other energy companies are private.  Bord na M&oacute;na is doing a remarkable job of transforming from brown to green.  It has an enormous investment programme, particularly in renewable generation, that is showing real success.<\/p><p>I see our semi-State companies, in addition to other operators in the market, as having a role in helping us out of this crisis rather than being the cause of it.

We are here to discuss the transfer of &euro;128.6 million from subhead B4 - residential and community retrofit - to subhead B11.  We discussed this move previously but were not clear about where and to what level the funding would be moved and where it would come from.  The Minister acknowledged that transfer but said the Department will maintain delivery outputs.  How can the Minister make that claim?  It seems contradictory to take &euro;128.6 million while still expecting to maintain delivery outputs.  It begs the question as to whether the Department's delivery outputs were too low in the first place or whether it over-allocated in the budget.  How can the Minister make the claim that delivery outputs will be maintained?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns the degree to which this transfer has been energy poverty-proofed.  For example, &euro;62 million was approved for the better energy communities scheme in the revised Supplementary Estimate.  That figure has now been reduced to &euro;43 million so &euro;19 million has been taken from that budget.  That scheme has a specific role in energy poverty reduction, as acknowledged by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the Government's environmental assessment in 2020.  We are supporting this legislation and the transfer of this funding but at a departmental level, how was the decision made to identify the funding?  I would have thought areas of the Department's expenditure that were not specifically allocated to energy poverty reduction could have been more ideally targeted.  The Minister's figures for deep retrofits last year show 1,800 of those deep retrofits were achieved by the addition of solar PV, which is great.  This indicates that the houses that are benefiting from that were already cosy and well-insulated compared with others that might have a D, E or F building energy rating and need more significant work.  Within the range of options and funds available to the Minister, was there not more appropriate funding that would not impact on energy poverty reduction initiatives?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#C00300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Regarding the inflationary effects of energy price rises, particularly the rising cost of gas, which is driving up the cost of electricity, it was clear in most of the second half of last year that we were going to have to do something.  It relates to one of the measures we had in mind in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was to use some of the carryover we had, which I think was some &euro;57 million, as a result of an underspend last year because a lot of retrofitting could not take place last year due to Covid.  We decided to use some of that carryover - the &euro;128 million that has been transferred in the way described by the Deputy - to recognise that we would probably need it for some fuel price support measure.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the balance, social protection and energy poverty proofing must be taken into account in the wider context than the national retrofit plan, which was launched last November, and the very specific details announced two weeks ago.  I think it was a &euro;267 million package.  The design of that was very much done with addressing fuel poverty in mind.  I think something like &euro;118 million of that &euro;267 million is in the warmer homes 100% grant targeted at those on the lowest incomes.  There is also an allocation of &euro;85 million within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage targeting social housing retrofitting.  If we take those two sums, of the some one third of &euro;1 billion between the various measures, two thirds of it is targeted at energy poverty measures.  It was appropriate that the Government made the decision, particularly given that we had to act fast and did not want a further measure that was more universal in nature because even with all the planning as regards social welfare increases and the targeting of roughly &euro;200 million at social housing, there are people who fall through the gaps.  The benefit of a &euro;200 credit is that it gets to everyone quickly.  I believe that was the correct approach.  I think there was a call for that mix.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of whether we are reducing ambition, if at the end of this year, we find that the demand for and level of public interest in the retrofitting scheme is such that we are coming to the end of our budget and are unable to meet all demand, I am very confident I will be able to go back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, particularly in these circumstances when everything has to be focused towards energy efficiency and burning less Russian oil, coal and gas, and get a further Supplementary Estimate if we find demand outstrips supply.  Our biggest problem in recent years has been the opposite so I am confident.  This &euro;267 million programme is huge.  There has been massive expansion.  If that is not sufficient, I am confident we will be able to look for further funding because this is a significant priority for Government - not just for climate reasons but for energy security and fuel poverty reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#C00400","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I do not deny the headline figures outlined by the Minister in terms of the budget and spend.

The better energy communities scheme has been identified as one that must reduce its spend in the year ahead.  To what degree is fuel poverty reduction prioritised in the decision-making process at departmental level?  Some of the options available to the Minister have a greater impact on reducing fuel poverty than others.  Notwithstanding the big spend, when the Minister made the decision relating to this scheme, what level of importance was given to fuel poverty bearing in mind that there has been a &euro;19 million reduction involving a transfer to a scheme that is universal?  That is acknowledged as a weakness across the board.

One way we will do that is with the new applications to the warmer home scheme   We will do that once we have cleared the backlog, which will be done quickly, of 7,000 houses that built up during the pandemic.  We are looking at the pre-1993 houses because the building regulations were changed in 1991.  Houses from 1993 tend to be above a BER D+ standard.  We are right to target those in that way.<\/p> <p>  The energy communities are the right way to do that.  It is up to 600, I think, so it is starting to take off.  That is a good mechanism but the Deputy is correct that we need to go further.  The one-stop shop system will allow companies that are operating as such to do exactly what the Deputy is suggesting, namely to go in and aggregate and market this to a community as something where they can provide a community solution or aggregated response.  Houses on an estate tend to all have the same fabric and energy structures.  The one-stop shop is geared towards that kind of aggregation of response, which is the right way to go.<\/p> <p>  On the loan, I was really hopeful that we would have something like 3.5% which would be a remarkably low interest rate in the current circumstances.  We do not have final confirmation of that.  <\/p> <p>  One reason for the summer-early autumn date is that it is unprecedented that the EIB would be involved.  It has never dealt in a loan system that is directly customer facing.  We have to tick all the boxes, dot all the i's and cross all the t's in the European mechanism.  It is on the edge of new, innovative financing.  I am confident it is going to work and will be hugely beneficial.  Even for people starting their work now, I am confident that it will be there in time for many who want to use it.<\/p> <p>  I agree about the potential use of smart metering as a mechanism.  As I mentioned in reply to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, pushing the time of day pricing and ensuring it is used is one way in which we can reduce our use of fossil fuels, allow households to save money by their management of energy use and benefit from the investment we have made in the smart metering programme.  That is the sort of measure we can look at.  The Government will probably look at two steps.  One is a more immediate response around the price issues we have now but beyond that the Department is looking at further ways by which we can accelerate or support energy efficiency measures.  That type of example may be one where we would work with the CRU, ESB Networks and others.  We can see if we can fast-track measures that we projected we would do in future and respond to this emergency crisis situation by advancing some of them now to help out householders.  I would not rule that out.<\/p> <p>  I would have to check the technical aspects but I think that the Corrib field is halfway through its lifetime.  It is the natural pressure from the field.  Corrib is not a very large gas field.  It was a fluke geologically.  It had a salt cap on it and it does not have any neighbouring fields.  It is a relatively simple pipeline connection into a processing centre.  My expectation is that the pressure from the field would drive the output.  It is not that easy to ramp up output and give us further supply. <\/p> <p>  We have other mechanisms.  Some of our power stations are adjacent to our oil stocks, which are often in the form of distillate that can be burned in power stations.  There would obviously have to be a connection.  Poolbeg is one example where we have a combined cycle gas plant adjacent to some of our strategic oil stocks.  That gives us some flexibility and capability.  In addition to the national reserve, the other power stations also retain some fuel.  We can change switch from gas to distillate and some of our oil reserves.<\/p> <p>  Even if we made a decision tomorrow on LNG and Shannon it would be a five- to ten-year delivery for anything and it would not address the immediate issue.  The wider strategic issue there is looking at what is advancing increasingly rapidly across European countries, which is the conversion of renewables particularly, offshore wind, through electrolysis for hydrogen.  I understand from the ESB is that it is very confident that any new power generation at Moneypoint, not as it now configured, or all new gas-fired power generation, will be hydrogen.<\/p><p>Those are some of the strategic questions we will have to look at.  However, that will not address the immediate crisis.  We have an immediate issue.  We are in a better position than most other European countries as we were only reliant on Russian gas for 2% to 4% of our gas supply.  We are more reliant on oil, at about 8% to 10%, and are now less reliant on coal.  The Moneypoint contract with Russia has concluded and further coal will come in from Colombia or other locations.  We are going to have to look at all those strategic matters but the more immediate issue is how we manage this and pushing efficiency and renewables as the immediate response to what is a fossil fuel induced crisis.  Dependence on fossil fuel is our core weakness at the centre of this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#D00400","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his updates.  My first question follows on from Deputy O'Rourke's points about poverty-proofing and the use of departmental funds for the universal electricity rebate.  There have been talks about excise duty rates and a swing mechanism being put in place for that.  Has the Government had any discussions about VAT reductions?  Hitting the VAT and tax would have been a much more efficient way of doing it.  The premise behind the electricity rebate was that it was to be universal and quick but it could be six months before this measure actually hits people's bank balances or electricity accounts.  It certainly has not been quick and is not meeting people's needs now, whereas a reduction in VAT or excise would be an immediate reduction that people could feel.  It would also mean that the budget of the Department was not impacted by the measures.  As part of its toolbox for dealing with the fuel crisis, the EU has specified that VAT is one of the tools that should be used by governments.  Has the Government had any specific discussions with the EU on whether a penalty-free derogation could be applied, just because of the crisis we are in, when it comes to VAT measures?<\/p> <p>  On the swing mechanism that has been talked about for excise, what I have seen reported is that it will apply to the increase, so if there are any further increases in the price of fuel, the swing mechanism will come into play.  Does that mean the Government is essentially setting a cap at where we are at the moment?  Where we are at the moment is completely unacceptable and is putting huge pressure on families and businesses.  I am concerned that the Government thinks it is only the future increases that need to be dealt with through excise measures. <\/p> <p>  Regarding the one-stop shops and retrofitting, I understand that the portal is open and a number of applications have been made.  The last time I heard the Minister speak about this, he said the process should be complete this week.  Is that still on track?  When does he foresee the announcement of how many companies have registered under the one-stop shop process?  Will that be available shortly?<\/p> <p>  On just transition and ensuring we help the people who need it most, were there any conditions put onto companies registering as a one-stop shop?  Were there any conditions stating that they needed to be targeted in their approach?  As Deputy Bruton mentioned, that aggregate approach is the quickest and most efficient way, as someone could deal with all the houses in an estate in one go.  Is there a requirement on these companies to be targeted so they do not just pick the lowest-hanging fruit or the easiest and cheapest houses to retrofit?  It should be done on a socioeconomic basis or based on the age profile of the house.  Is there a requirement on these companies to provide a certain number of apprenticeships?  One of the problems we will face as this ramps up is the skills shortage and we need to address that.  If there was a requirement on these one-stop shops to provide a percentage of apprenticeships, that would be very positive.  Is that condition on them as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#E00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The Deputy got a lot of questions in there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#E00300","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>This credit mechanism will kick in next month, not in six months' time.

Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned some of the price caps.  Other mechanisms, such as revenues from the emissions trading system, ETS, and VAT, have been used.  There are a variety of different mechanisms, including excise duty.  We have not finalised any measures.  The Minister for Finance has a key role working within the European context and we will do further work in that regard.  I would not rule anything out.  Nothing is finalised.  There has been media commentary about a swing mechanism around excise duty, which has real advantages in terms of smoothing out and what happens if there is an excise cut and prices go up further.  However, there are difficulties around that legally so it may not be possible.  With regard to tax, we have to use legislation and make sure it is all legally correct.<\/p> <p>  While we are looking at additional measures, they will not protect fully from the scale of price increases.  We should be clear on that.  The increases are beyond compare.  If we did try to fully protect everything, that would have immediate effects on the other budgets the Exchequer has to fund, such as for education or social welfare.  We will have additional costs as a result of this crisis.  The &euro;500 million package, on top of what was done in the budget last October, was the right response.  We were not intending to do anything further until October but the war has changed that.  As I said, whatever mechanism is used will not be just on the tax side, on excise or VAT.  It will also have to be the mechanisms I was discussing with Deputy Bruton on the efficiency side as well.  If the State were to try to reverse all the global increases in coal, oil and gas prices, that would burst the budget.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the one-stop shop, aggregation and apprenticeships, we are on track.  I had a meeting with the officials yesterday and got an update on this.  We are on track to start announcing double figures in the next week.  My understanding is that the numbers already going through the process to get up and running in that timeframe are as we would expect.  We have a certain advantage in that we, and the SEAI in particular, have been working on this for 22 years.  The SEAI has been given very significant additional resources.  As well as the &euro;22 million the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science put in place for the green skills action programme in last year's budget, recognising those sorts of apprenticeships, we have a number of mechanisms in place.  The SEAI and the industry have built up expertise over 20 years of learning by doing, making mistakes and adjusting, so we are well placed to hit the ground running on this.  Not only has there been an incredible domestic response but we are hearing that the phones have been ringing off the hook at those apprenticeship schemes in recent weeks following that announcement.  That is encouraging.  We are well placed and will be able to deliver that sort of innovative use with the one-stop shop.  These companies will have to be good at getting the apprenticeships up and running and helping them find work but also targeting households and aggregating them. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#E00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>On that question, is there a requirement on the one-stop-shops in their operating the licence with the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, or is there a condition they must target what houses they look at, so it is not just left to the authority to pick the ones that could be relatively cheap and easy to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#F00100","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>It is not told exactly what houses it should go to or could go to.

I will take the opportunity in the few minutes that remain to ask a few questions.  I apologise for perhaps straying from the Standing Orders and away from the Supplementary Estimate.  The energy crisis we have, and the cost of living challenge as a result of it, are inextricably linked with transport costs.  The Minister has two roles here as the Minister for energy and climate, and for transport.  It seems to me that in trying to address the cost-of-living challenge, we should look to the transport cost challenge people have.  If we are ambitious and radical to pursue aggressively modal shift in our cities in particular, and in rural areas if we can really ramp up the level of our bus services, these would seem a very realistic and effective way of addressing the cost-of-living challenges people have.  I expect that all across Europe these kinds of measures will be introduced and it would make sense we would do so in Ireland also.<\/p><p>My second question relates more to the Supplementary Estimate.  Maybe it is a question for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Will the Minister tell the committee anything about the windfall that has accrued to the State on the increase in energy prices?  Essentially, the &euro;200 rebate is the State paying back to people the extra tax it has received.  I accept this may be more of a question for the Minister of Finance, but the Minister, Deputy Ryan, might wish to comment.<\/p><p>My third question is around Europe's role in the more medium to long term.  The joint committee had some very interesting sessions this morning where we talked about the much bigger potential in Ireland to provide clean energy for our own needs and to contribute to Europe's needs.  There was a very interesting article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Dr. Hannah Daly, Dr. Diarmuid Torney,  Dr. Paul Deane, and Dr. Olexandr Balyk that really spoke to that.  It is a medium to long-term prospect, but with the energy and security crises on the other side of the Continent, we should be talking at the European level about accelerating as much as we can the opportunity Ireland has.  Perhaps the Minister will speak to those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#F00500","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I understand the committee also engaged this morning with some of the officials from my Department on offshore renewables.  One of the things we have been working on, and which we have agreed in the Cabinet subcommittee, is the establishment of new delivery task forces that would accelerate key areas for our climate ambitions, such as just transition, climate communications, and land use review, and in the three more immediately specific areas of the development of offshore renewables, the development of our domestic heating strategies, including what we are talking about today, and sustainable mobility.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of those teams, which are cross-cutting and bring officials from different Departments together, along with outside agencies and international expertise, means we recognise for the lifetime of this Government, which is the next three years, that we have an immediate delivery issue up to 2025.  We must accelerate key elements of what we need to do.  For example, in the offshore wind area we need to get phase 1 and phase 2. With phase 3, as the Chairman has said, we must give a clear direction to Europe that Ireland is the place to come for offshore wind.  Similarly, when it comes to retrofitting, we need to make sure we deliver on our ambitions for a scale of retrofitting, and we need to look particularly at district heating as well as retrofitting, including existing projects such as taking heat from the incinerators to heat some parts of the Dublin Bay area.  All of those projects will have a rapid three-year acceleration timetable, which these delivery task forces will monitor, manage, and oversee.<\/p> <p>  In sustainable mobility, while we will not be able to build the metro in the next three years, we have a good bit of the Cork metropolitan rail project done.  We can accelerate the active travel and BusConnects projects, especially in our five cities, and the Connecting Ireland rural bus transport system.  One of the delivery task forces is within the Department of Transport.  The leadership group there will look to see how we accelerate.  This is all the more important now given what is happening with the rising cost of fossil fuels and the energy security issues.  As it happens, today the Cabinet has just approved the decision on phase 1 for the BusConnects project for Dublin.  For example, we got a three-year timeline.  BusConnects was originally designed to take much longer, but there are some elements I hope we can accelerate to get the sustainable mobility shift the Chairman has spoken about.  The real project with my job in the two Departments for which I have responsibility and in working with others is delivering an accelerated programme of works in those areas.<\/p> <p>  On the energy prices question, the Chairman must ask that of the Minister for Finance.  I will be asking the Minister later this afternoon about what exactly is the windfall gain to the State.  To be honest, that is slightly false accounting in a way.  Yes, it does get State revenue, but we must remember Ireland is 90% dependent on imported fossil fuels for energy.  When the cost of energy goes up like that, the balance of payments situation for the State disimproves.  That money is going out of the country.<\/p> <p>  I will give a vivid example of that.  Prior to the immediate and recent invasion, Russia was getting in revenue from Europe in the region of &euro;350 million per day from exported gas, oil and coal.  An equivalent of this is that the United States of America has delivered a package of support to Ukraine of &euro;350 million, which is not insignificant, but that was a one-day receipt for the oil, gas and coal revenues for Russia.  Since the price escalation, that &euro;350 million figure is probably an historical figure and is now probably closer to &euro;1 billion per day, every day, day in, day out.<\/p> <p>  This is why in Europe there is an absolute clear determination.  I recently attended a meeting with EU energy ministers and an International Energy Agency meeting.  The real focus there is that we must stop that flow of money.  It will not be immediate sanctions on oil, gas or coal because this would further exacerbate our problem and put prices up.  The European Council will continue to look at that issue.  The underlying strategic imperative on divesting from fossil fuels has never been stronger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12022030800002#F00600","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>On sustainable transport, I believe there is a parallel here from two years ago when Covid arrived.  The Minister's predecessor, Shane Ross, in one of his last acts as Minister introduced emergency legislation to facilitate the roll-out of active travel infrastructure in particular.  We are in a similar situation now.  Does the Minister, Deputy Ryan, believe there is merit in an emergency response?  Obviously, we will try to increase the level of active travel development in the next few years.  Ireland has an ambitious programme in that regard.  There is, however, an acute crisis now right now with regard to energy.<\/p><p>Facilitating active travel is certainly one of the solutions.

We need to be really flexible and fast but we cannot ignore local authorities bearing in mind their interest and knowledge of how we do that.  I agree that we should be looking at fast-tracking and accelerating, but it also needs to come from the bottom up.  I will have a meeting with representatives from Limerick City and County Council this Friday and that is the message I will give them.  I will ask them if they are up for it and what we could do if we were really thinking outside the box.  The benefit of that is not just in reducing usage of fossil fuels and taking on Mr. Putin at the pump, as it were; it is also helping us with a better environment and better climate, and making it a more attractive place for everyone to live.

Amendment No. 77 is important.  It just shows the power of language and what is meant in this Bill.  The substitution of the word \"records\" for \"information\" is vital.  Information implies that whoever is the holder of the record can decide what is released, and that is the crux of the problem.  We are going to have a situation where that is going to have to be challenged and go through that whole process before it can be decided whether somebody has not released the full information.  That is wrong.  It should not be in this, particularly when we are dealing with a group of people who have had everything that the State has done against them to this point.  We should be making it easier for them now.  It shows the importance of language and of a simple word like that.  For that reason this amendment should be accepted.  I do not see that it would impact significantly on the legislation.  It would remove a lot of the burden of complying with the legislation as well, because rather than having to decide which information one does or does not want to release, the assumption is that one would release everything.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  In summary, the other amendments are the same.  They seek to change and put in words and I am happy to support them.

The whole purpose behind this legislation is to provide adopted people with information.  We have discussed the various categories of information.  However, its purpose is also to provide them with provided items.  If anything was left for them by their family members, they should be entitled to it.  That is why we have drawn this broad definition.  It is not a random definition or something that was concocted quickly.  It has been worked on and thought about in the context of this legislation.  That is really important to state.  Every definition here has been thought about in a lot of detail to ensure it interacts properly with the rest of this legislation and also with other legislation.  Where we have recognised that the definitions we have do not square with everything, as was the case with the last amendment, we are happy to admit that and bring forward changes.  However, we do not believe that the changes Deputies have proposed here are appropriate.<\/p> <p>  As it currently stands, the definition sets out the different items that may be contained within records that must be released in all cases.  The types of items included in the definition are letters, photographs, mementoes or any other documents or objects.  The list provided in the legislation on page 12 is not exhaustive.  That is really important.  It also provides for the different types of people who may lodge a provided item.  This includes parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles and first cousins.  Both items placed on historic files and items provided through the contact preference register that will be established under this legislation are provided for.<\/p> <p>  I cannot support amendment No. 79.  As I have said, the definition of a \"provided item\" is central to ensuring clarity and consistency and guaranteeing the release of items and it provides an important mechanism through which historic items can be shared with the person to whom they relate and family members will be allowed to share contemporaneously provided items.<\/p> <p>  Again, I cannot support amendment No. 80.  The definition of a \"provided item\" was carefully considered in the drafting of the Bill and the list of persons who can deposit provided items was carefully considered in that drafting.  To make it clear, the ability to lodge a provided item with the authority under section 39(1) is not the only way in which a person can share information.  The robust statutory tracing service established under Part 8 of this legislation provides for information to be shared or requested while maintaining the level of contact a person is comfortable with.  It is important that the tracing service allows the person initiating the trace and the person on the other end of the trace to have the final say with regard to the degree of contact they want.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 165, 166, 168 to 172, inclusive, 226 to 228, inclusive, 258 and 260, I again cannot support the amendments.  In terms of the threshold for the release of information, it is important to note that, as it stands, the section does not stipulate the threshold of proof required to fulfil the criteria in respect of a specified item or provided item for the purposes of being made available to the relevant person.  I will be publishing policy guidelines in respect of that.  We discussed the issue of the provision of policy guidelines when we discussed similar amendments last week.  These guidelines will confirm the ability of the bodies to release provided items.  In the future, any provided items lodged under section 39(1) will fall under the criteria of specified items or items provided for the purpose of being made available to the same person and their release will not require any degree of discretion.<\/p> <p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 168 and 172, while I understand the intention behind these amendments, it is important to note that the application process is important for a number of reasons, the most significant of these being that relevant persons have complete control over the categories of information they are seeking and wish to access.  That is important.  We want to maintain that process.  <\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 171, 227 and 260 seek to place an obligation on both the agency and the authority to seek out records that they do not hold without any certainty that they exist.  Again, the whole purpose behind this legislation is to require the authority or the agency to release all information it has.  It will not have a choice or discretion but must release that information.  These amendments ask the authority or agency to go looking for information that it does not have and that it does not even know exists.  We have spoken about division of resources and the need to allow these agencies to focus on the delivery of what will be, in the initial years, a significant amount of information.  To ask them to go looking for information when they do not know whether it exists is not a good use of the resources of either the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, or Tusla when large numbers of people are on waiting lists whose information is available and there to be released.  There is also the question of how we would ever know whether this obligation has been fulfilled.  How do you ever know if an agency has done all it can to find information that you do not know exists?

Again, this speaks to the concern that we touched on at the end of our discussion the last day, the sense among many adopted people that there was a culture of not releasing information.  When you look at the history in this area, there was definitely such a culture in the past.  As I stated the last day, we are doing two things to address that culture, beyond this legislation which clearly provides for a legal basis and legal obligation to release information.  One is the establishment of the implementation group, headed by my Department, which brings together Tusla, AAI and the Department to talk about the approach to be taken.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department have met those who will lead the implementation of this legislation and both agencies to talk about the change in culture.  I know Mr. Bernard Gloster has appeared before this committee and members have spoken to him.  It is very clear that he realises the need for a change in culture particularly in Tusla regarding its culture of release of information.  Beyond that there is also the publication of guidelines.  If a future Minister believes that the changing culture is not being manifest, those guidelines can be tightened and refined to ensure that we get full release of all information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#H00700","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646697600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 80:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 12, line 19, to delete &ldquo;involved in the provision of care of&rdquo;

This definition includes a list of bodies that, on the enactment of the legislation, are immediately designated as secondary information sources.  These include the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Minister for Education, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the data controller of the Access to Institutional and Related Records archive, AIRR, the HSE, a registered adoption society, and an accredited body.  Importantly, the definition also allows a Minister to designate a secondary information source under section 43 (2).  The power of the Minister, that is me or any future Minister, to designate other groups as a secondary information source under this legislation is a key element.<\/p> <p>  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 93 to 101, and 107 and 108.  They seek to expand the list of secondary information sources within the legislation itself.  Again, I do not believe this is necessary because the power is already included under section 43(2), to designate other bodies, and any body so designated would be classified as a secondary information source.<\/p> <p>  Section 43(2) empowers a Minister to prescribe additional information sources.  The proposed addition of amendments Nos. 94 to 108 is unnecessary.  Importantly, it would also generate obligations on an unclear list of people.  It is unclear who would come within the definition of an organisation involved in the care of a relevant person.  That would appear to potentially engage every organisation that has provided a health or social care service at every stage of a person's life.  What is being proposed here is an absolutely vast array of coverage, which goes far beyond the focus of what this Bill is trying to achieve.  The list currently included in the published Bill was carefully considered through consultation with stakeholders and organisations that are currently operating in the area of adoption information release and tracing, or that hold specific sets of historical records.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, secondary information sources are relevant only in their obligation to safeguard relevant records under Part 7.  This is very important.  We are talking about the safeguarding element here.  The legislation already provides a catch-all requirement for any person or organisation in possession of a relevant record, to safeguard it and to inform the authority that it holds that relevant record under section 46.  There is already a catch-all provision there under section 46.<\/p> <p>  I intend to make regulations designating further relevant bodies and secondary information sources.  Private entities, church bodies and religious congregations can be so designated.  It is important in designing those regulations that they are carefully constructed to clearly and accurately identify the relevant holder of records.  For example, Tusla now holds many of the institutional records, which people may believe are in the possession of religious congregations.  As we are aware, a huge amount of the information that was held by the congregations, especially those who ran mother and baby home and county home institutions, has already been transferred over to Tusla.  At different dioceses or parish levels there may be baptismal records, which would be highly valuable for relevant persons.  Again, we are using the regulation power under the legislation to design it carefully so we can have regulations that target exactly the relevant record holders, so we can deliver records to people, rather than the extremely broad brush approach proposed here that brings far too much potential information far beyond what this legislation is designed to cover, and which causes real difficulties in the future.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be clear that there are mechanisms set out in the legislation, primarily the ability to designate a secondary information source under section 43(2), and separately, the ability of the catch-all subsection in section 46 to address issues of concern here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#K00050","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I hope that some of this is addressed in whatever regulations are published.

It is included for accuracy and precision in the terms of drafting.  The reason I cannot accept the amendment is because it would delete the section entirely and offers no substitution or alternative for it.  In the case of an adopted person, this time period ends where they were adopted.  In the case of someone who was the subject of an illegal birth registration the period ends at the time their social parents took over responsibility for them.  <\/p><p> The legislation that we have here is primarily aimed at supporting relevant persons to exercise their right to identity through access to information relating to the origin of their birth and early life and for individuals affected, this can only be fully inserted and achieved through clear access via statutory pathway to the information that is on the historic files.  We know this information will guarantee that for the first time.  The amendment, however, seeks to remove this focus and instead extend the period until the relevant person is 18 years old.  It is important that this amendment will have no practical purpose because if a person is adopted at the age of 12 years there will be no further information held by adoption agencies about them because they will now be with their adopted parents.  Saying that there will be early life information about them and extending that up to the age of 18 years would not work in this situation.  There will only be early life and care information about them for the length of time that they are in an institution.  That ends at the time they are either adopted or, as we know in certain cases, the subject of an illegal birth registration.  That is why we do not feel that this is correct.

I was afraid that we might get to this section after I had to leave so I am glad that I have the opportunity to speak because this is one of the key sections.  It is one of the key contentious issues.  If you took everything else away this might be best described as the red line.  It relates to the mandatory information session.  People feel very strongly that if a parent registers a no contact preference that they would then be asked to attend a meeting.  Regardless of whether it is with a social worker, in an in-person meeting, over Zoom or a phone call, people feel very strongly that they do not want it to take place.  It should not inhibit them getting access to their birth certificates and other information.  People feel that there is an attitude that the State knows best.  It is something that arose a lot at our committee hearings.  The committee did recommend the use of registered post and that has since been discussed in the D&aacute;il and so on.  I feel very strongly that it is an alternative we should look at putting in place.  This is one part of the Bill that I would not be able to accept at all.  We need to go back to the drawing board on the whole area of a mandatory information session.  It is not right or fair on individuals looking for their birth certificate.  There is a fear about what exactly will be said at these meetings.<\/p><p>From the State's point of view, I do not really understand why it would not be better to have a registered letter because it is there in black and white and nobody can say that something was said at a meeting that was not said.  It is a lot more straightforward.  I know there will be many arguments as to why that is not the case but I feel very strongly about it.  I know people are very upset about it and they wanted us to communicate the view that they do not want a mandatory information session in any way, shape or form regardless of whether it is just a phone call, which might not seem like a big deal to people but really is.  It is important that their rights and wishes are respected and that this is changed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#L02100","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I also must go to the Chamber shortly to speak.

My amendments in this grouping are Nos. 119 to 122, inclusive; Nos. 123 to 126, inclusive; Nos. 132 to 137, inclusive; and No. 144.  I have other amendments in the next grouping as well, all of which relate to the mandatory information session, which as we have all heard and know, is the most contentious issue in the Bill as it currently stands.  We know the long history and that what is being proposed by the Minister and Department is an improvement on what went before in terms of conditions on access but nonetheless requiring a information session means that access remains conditional.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, all of us devised an alternative arrangement involving a registered post letter, which we believed would have answered the arguments made by the Minister and Department about some sort of communication and would have been infinitely preferable to requiring an information session.<\/p> <p>  There are two key points.  What happens if an adopted person refuses to engage or does not wish to engage in the information session?  I know the Minister talks about untrammelled access to information but the reality is that there is that condition that the records cannot be released unless the information session is engaged in and there does not seem to us to be any recourse to be had if a person does not wish to engage in that information session so it is a condition on access.  I cannot see how it could not be.  These amendments are designed to remove that condition on access.  Amendment No. 199 in the next group will replace it with a registered post provision similar to the recommendation in our report.  <\/p> <p>  The second point, which was made by Deputy Cairns, is that we took the view that registered post would also be a safer option from everyone's point of view because it sets out in writing any issues whereas the content of a phone call can be very problematic.  It can be very difficult for somebody in a vulnerable position to take a phone call and it can be very difficult to establish what was said in a phone call or have any clarity or record of what was said in a phone call.  To require mandatory information sessions and say it can be done by phone still amounts to a condition on access to the data, records and actual life information of the individual.  It also seems to be less safe and secure than the registered post option we suggested to meet the constitutional argument that was made by the Department to ensure there would be free right of access to information and birth records.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#M00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have this opportunity to discuss these issues because Deputies are right.  This section is central to this legislation and is central to us being able to ensure that if this legislation is challenged, it will be found to be constitutional.  That is a very real risk.  Many of the difficulties adopted people face in this area are the result of a constitutional challenge about the release of information in the case of  I. O'T <i>v<\/i>. B.  I know there are many criticisms of the way in which it has interpreted by courts, successive Governments and State agencies but nevertheless that case has had a massive influence.  That was a situation where a parent challenged the release of information so we are not talking in the abstract here.  Because of the fraught history of adoption in this country, the secrecy around it and the need for secrecy that is still experienced by some adopted people and, in particular, some mothers, this is a fraught area so we must design legislation that is not at risk of being found to be unconstitutional.<\/p><p>We are trying to balance two sets of constitutional rights here.  Much of our discussion at this point has been about the right of the adopted person to their identity.  This is a right that successive Irish Governments and legislation have failed to vindicate.  We must say this upfront.  Adopted people have been failed when it comes to the vindication of their right to identity.  The right to identity is now recognised by the courts as an unenumerated right and a constitutional right and it is recognised under EU law as well.  With this legislation, we are seeking to vindicate that right.  However, there is another set of rights holders in many of these cases.  This involves a parent seeking to exercise their right to privacy.  Again, it is important for us to realise that we cannot make any value judgments about the decision of a parent to exercise that right.  If a parent wishes to remain anonymous from a child they gave up for adoption, that is their right and that is an exercise of their right to privacy.  We may think it is terrible that they must feel that need, and it is something I personally feel, but it is not my decision to make.  It is their exercise of their privacy right, which is a constitutional right.  It is important that we balance constitutional rights in this situation.  <\/p><p>One of the amendments here proposes to delete this section in its entirety - this balancing section set out by the information session.  I very much wish to put on the record that if this section is deleted in its entirety, this Bill will be constitutionally flawed because there will be no recognition of privacy rights and this will be easily struck down by any future court.  <\/p><p>In terms of how the balancing mechanism we are bringing forward in this legislation works, an adopted person seeks access to their information.  The agency looks at the contact preference register.  Where a preference accepting contact is put on the contract preference register or there is no entry in the register, all information is immediately provided to the adopted person.  Nothing more needs to happen.  All information is released through whatever mechanism the adopted person wants.  If they want it sent to them in written or photocopied form, that is fine.  If they want it in an email, that is fine.  If the agency finds that there is a no-contact preference, which is something a parent will have proactively do following the introduction of the three-month public information campaign that will follow the passing of this legislation, and the parent has decided they want it registered that they do not want contact, the agency will call the adopted person or undertake an online or in-person meeting.<\/p><p>It is important to remember that it can be by way of a telephone call as well.  In that telephone call, three elements will be discussed.  First, the designated person, who no longer has to be a social worker because we took on board people's concerns about a social worker, will inform the adopted or boarded-out person of the entitlement of the relevant person to obtain his or her birth certificate and birth information related to him to her, as the case may, in accordance with this Act.  Second, &quot;that the parent concerned has stated, in accordance with this Act, that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person&quot;.  The third element is the &quot;importance of the relevant person respecting the privacy rights of the parent and the preference of the parent referred to in <i>paragraph (b)<\/i>&quot;.  That is the content of the telephone call as set down clearly in legislation.  I have heard the concerns that adopted people have expressed about the content of that telephone call.  I propose to bring forward an amendment to section 17(2)(c), which we will have an opportunity to discuss later on.  <br\/><br\/>That is the process.  After the telephone call has taken place and those three points have been conveyed to the relevant person - the adopted person - the full information is provided for.  We are going from a situation where a statement by a parent that he or she wanted to exercise his or her privacy rights meant an adopted person got nothing to one where, when a parent exercises his or her privacy rights, the above mentioned elements are conveyed to the adopted person by way of telephone call and the adopted person gets everything.  That is the scale of the change we are talking about here.  It is important to understand the scale of that change because that is a huge limitation on the privacy rights of the parent.  The balance has entirely shifted from one that favoured the privacy rights of the parent in almost every situation, and led to adopted people being so restricted for so long, to a situation where the privacy rights of the parent are restricted.  Parents cannot now keep their names from the adopted person in any situation.  All they can do is, through this process, have their no-contact preference conveyed to the adopted person.  It cannot be enforced.  In previous drafts, the adopted person was asked to sign a statutory undertaking, which later changed to a non-statutory undertaking.  In one of the earlier drafts, there was a criminal prohibition on the adopted person contacting the parent.  All of that is removed.  All that has to take place now is this meeting.  <br\/><br\/>Why have we chosen the idea of an information session?  It is important to reference that this is not something that came from my Department.  Rather, it this is something that has been discussed as a means of balancing those sets of rights.  I will refer to a couple of documents from outside of my Department.  In their analysis of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 introduced by former Minister, Katherine Zappone, a group of academics brought forward an opinion on the Irish Constitution and EU general data protection regulations.  The academics are people well known to us, including Dr. Conor O'Mahony, Dr. Fred Logue, Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, Dr. James Gallen, Dr. Eoin Daly, Mair&eacute;ad Enright, Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Ring, Rossa McMahon and Dr. Laura Cahillane.  They did a detailed analysis on the previous legislation.  It is a lengthy piece, with which, I am sure, members are familiar, but I would like to cite paragraph 30.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThus, in order for legislation in the area of adoption information and tracing to be deemed unconstitutional, it must be shown that the law is arbitrary and lacks an objective basis.  It is on this basis that we submit that the Constitution does permit the Oireachtas to legislate in the manner proposed by several Senators earlier this year: providing automatic access to identifying information for people who were adopted in the past following an information session, and accompanied by a fully resourced voluntary National Adoption Contact Preference Register and voluntary tracing service. <\/blockquote><p>Again, the concept of the information meeting is set out in that detailed piece.  I refer also to the draft Bill, namely, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2019, that was put forward by the Adoption Rights Alliance in 2019, which was an effort by that organisation, which has been very active in this area, to seek to balance the conflicting rights, the privacy right of a parent with the right to identity of an adopted person.  I will set out sections 25(1) to 25(3), inclusive, of that draft Bill:<\/p><blockquote>\t(1) An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir shall on an application made in the prescribed manner by an adopted person, a record of whose birth is kept by an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir and who has reached the age of 18 years supply to that person on payment of the prescribed fee (if any) such information as is necessary to enable that person to obtain a certified copy of the record of his\/her birth. <br \/><br \/>(2) It shall be the duty of the Independent Information Service to provide an information session to the adopted person, the format of which shall be prescribed in consultation with the Adoption Advisory Group.  The information session shall serve the following purposes:   \t(a) To inform the adopted person about the records held by the Independent Information Service about them; <br \/><br \/>(b) To provide the adopted person with information on how to read and understand adoption records;<br \/><br \/>(c) To inform the adopted person of the existence of the tracing service provided by the Agency;<br \/><br \/>(d) To inform the adopted person of the existence of the National Adoption Contact Preference Register.  (3) An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir shall not supply a person who was adopted before the date on which this Act was passed with any information under subsections (1) and (2) of this section unless that person has attended an information session as prescribed under subsection (3) of this section. <\/blockquote><p>It is important to make the point that in terms of this effort to address issues with the previous legislation - I regret Deputy Bacik is leaving because I am about to cite her - Deputy Bacik stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tthe Minister could make provision for an option, such as that provided for in Averil Power's Bill, that those who do not wish to sign an undertaking could have an alternative option, such as a meeting a social worker or counsellor, as provided for.  Provision of such a meeting would have to ensure that it would not become unduly burdensome on those seeking to avail of the option, but this is a simple and practical way to get around this difficulty. <\/blockquote><p>Two years later, Deputy Bacik and colleagues brought forward an information session almost identical to the information session provided for in this legislation.  It is important to put that on record because there is a sense out there that this is some crude mechanism that is being introduced to inflict further injury and insult on adopted people when it is a mechanism that has been suggested by a range of highly knowledgeable sources to address that really difficulty and tricky situation we are grasping with, namely, how to reconcile those two sets of privacy rights.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#M00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>If I may, I would like to come in on that point before I have to leave to go to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It is a case of unfortunate timing.  The Minister is quoting back to me, as I had anticipated.  I have been measured in my comments.  I acknowledge that this is a far preferable option that the Minister is presenting us with as a means of balancing rights.  A few years ago, when we proposed the information session as an alternative to the signing of the statutory declaration and so on, that would have been preferable but things have moved on.  Just as incremental change becomes embedded and then more radical change is necessary, so too with the journey of this legislation, if I might put it that way.  It started out with a whole series of different conditions being placed on access to records.  <\/p><p>At the point I put forward the information session, I was working very closely with the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, to try to achieve a compromise in order that we could get the legislation through.  That was the intent.  That was everyone's desire at the time, most of all adopted persons.  We did work on different methods of doing that but at the time, the information session was opposed by the Attorney General as being unduly protective of the privacy rights of the birth mother.  The reality is we could not get that passed.  Clearly, things have shifted at the Attorney General's Office, but so too have they shifted in terms of our understanding of the rights of identity or of privacy rights.  The I.O'T <i>v. <\/i>B.case is now even more dated.  There is no specific right of privacy in the Constitution.  We are still relying on that interpretation in I.O'T <i>v. <\/i>B. and, clearly, the Attorney General's view has changed over the years.  It is fair to say that in terms of what would have been acceptable and preferable some years ago, the understanding has moved on.  That is the spirit in which I offered these amendments.  It is the spirit of our consensus in the pre-legislative scrutiny in terms of the registered post option put forward in the report.

We had that conversation around the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and law.  There is a recognition now that GDPR applies here, therefore, people have a right to this information.  Saying there is a constitutional barrier is ridiculous.  There is no constitutional barrier to people accessing their information.  It is also acting like this Bill is doing them some kind of favour.  Ultimately, it is worth questioning whether we even need this Bill and legislation.  If we just acknowledged people's rights to their information, we would not be sitting here having long debates about these things.<\/p><p> The other false narrative that is continuously spun, to the point where even Opposition Deputies are saying the same lines, is that we must balance the right of the parent to his or her privacy with the right of the adopted person's right to information.  That is not based on any kind of reality.  What we heard at committee during pre-legislative scrutiny was that more people are registering a no-contact preference who are the adopted people, and not the parents.  There is this constant narrative that what the Government and this legislation is doing is trying to protect the parents who have a right to privacy.  Where has that come from?  We hear these constant lines that are based on no reality, as far as I can tell.  After what was a long process of pre-legislative scrutiny with different representative organisations and people appearing before the committee, of course, we had loads of personal engagement with individuals who have been affected by this.  The narrative creates this feeling of trying to protect parents from their children.  It is unnecessary and untrue.<\/p><p> Finally, the Minister made a point at the end of his contribution about section 30.  He referenced people like Dr. Maeve O'Rourke and Dr. Fred Logue and suggested that an information session is a must-have.  That is really the opposite of what we heard from experts.  He said it has been recommended by many reputable sources.  We heard it refuted by many reputable sources at committee that we do not need that mandatory information session.  That seems to me like cherry-picking information to argue for something that is unnecessary and which people have highlighted repeatedly.  It is insulting for them.  As Deputy Bacik said, the suggestion, which the Minister cited, came from years ago when people were still trying to get this legislation moving.<\/p><p> We have come a long way from there, and not only we in the Oireachtas but the whole country, in terms of saying enough of these different barriers and things being put in place, and these kinds of narratives around people's situations.  It is not necessary and often also not true.  The Minister has done much work in this area since he took office.  If there is one thing he could change in this legislation, this seems to be the thing that means so much to people.  Will he please consider it?  I do not think we have to stick to it.

That right remains with them but the right of access to information under GDPR is not absolute in the same way it will be under this legislation.  A balancing test under Article 15(4) of GDPR still applies.  We are providing for the absolute right to access information in all situations in this legislation.  To address Deputy Cairns' question, that is why we are having this legislation.  We are taking away that discretion of the data controller to refuse somebody access to his or her information.  That is why this legislation is necessary.<\/p> <p>  It is really important that we address the argument in terms of what Deputy Cairns said, which is that this desire to protect the constitutional rights of parents is not based in reality.  It is based in reality.  Right now, we have a national adoption contact preference register.  Approximately 4,500 parents whose children were adopted have signed on to that and the vast majority of them are seeking contact with their children.  Only 1% or 99 people have signed a no-contact preference on the existing national adoption contact preference register.  I take the number of parents who do not want contact with their children from that and that is not all; that is a portion of people who have signed this.  It is tiny.  They are still rights holders, however.  Each of those 99 people still have a right to exercise their constitutional right to privacy.  If they decide that they do not want contact with the child they gave up for adoption, that is their right.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cairns asked where this came from.  She said many different groups came in and spoke before the committee.  Absolutely, and I have spoken with them too.  However, these women do not want to be known.  They are not going to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee for whatever reason because that identifies them.  Again, it comes back to the history of adoption in this country and the secrecy that surrounds it.  These women continue to exist in secret.  We must remember that the information session will only apply where a parent has signed a no-contact preference.  Based on what we are seeing from the existing national adoption contact preference register, it will only be a tiny proportion of the overall number of applications under this legislation where an information session is required.  In those situations, however, it is an exercise of a constitutional right.  It is the exercise of an individual who has proactively decided that he or she wants to provide some protection of his or her anonymity.  The fact is that they do not come into the Oireachtas joint committee or form advocacy groups.  We cannot let their desire and need for secrecy eliminate them from this conversation.  They do exist.  Their existence is demonstrated by the existing no-contact preference register.  I have received letters from women who have set out their concerns to me as parents.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  We are trying to achieve a recognition of their constitutional right to privacy but doing so in such a way that in every situation, the adopted person gets full access to his or her information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#O00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>For clarity, the Minister said 1% of the people who are on that register have registered a no-contact preference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#O00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>On the current national adoption preference register of the birth relatives,  4,495 birth relatives have registered.

I apologise because I had to leave in the middle of the debate earlier to go to statements in the D&aacute;il.  It was terrible timing.  I am sorry I did not hear the full response the Minister gave.<\/p> <p>  Without labouring the point, as I said we have gone through many different iterations with this legislation as we all know.  There have been many different attempts to achieve the balance between constitutional rights of identity and information versus the right to privacy.  As I said earlier, things have moved on.  The advice of the Attorney General has changed over the years in successive iterations of the Bill.  We are at a point where a mandatory information session should no longer be required as a condition of access to identity information, even if that mandatory information session is in much preferable format now to what it was and even if it may be carried out by phone and not by a social worker and all of the welcome improvements that have been made.<\/p> <p>  The committee, having heard the evidence and having heard from stakeholders, still believed there was a preferable means of achieving the balancing of rights and that this was through a prepaid registered post mechanism.  It is an acknowledgement there is some need to balance rights.  It is also an acknowledgement that the understanding of privacy and identity and conflicting rights has moved on since we last debated this type of Bill.  We should be able to move beyond a mandatory information session in any form.  I have tried in one amendment to set out as best I can a way of delivering on the recommendation we made.

I have set forward the reasons I believe, and more importantly why others believe, the information session and the provision of the conveying of the preference of the parent to the adopted person is the best way to go.  We discussed with the Attorney General and counsel the option of a letter.  It is not that we did not consider it.  The issue has been considered.  There are practical issues with a registered letter, particularly in the context of the amendment tabled by Deputy Bacik that everything would then have to be done by post.  The issuing of information would have to be done by post because it would have to contain the registered letter and the bundle of information.  Plenty of people want their information via email.  This means two sets of information would have to be sent out.  There are practical issues for data controllers in all of this.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right that the balancing mechanism has gone through various iterations.  Each iteration has brought the balance more in favour of the adopted persons and their right to identity but at the same time has lessened the privacy rights of the parent.<\/p><p>If that balance continues to move over, there comes a point where the privacy right will no longer be recognised by a court as a proper defence in terms of proportionality.  I hope we both agree on that.  In term of what is essential here, the no-contact preference is the final protection of the privacy right and that must be conveyed to the adopted person.  Is the best way to convey that a registered letter, where we will never know if the person actually read it or saw the line about the no-contact preference?  If there is a phone call, a physical meeting or an online meeting, we know the preference has been conveyed.  I am making changes and I will speak to them in a moment but that is the core element of what is necessary to ensure the right to privacy is sufficiently present and balanced in all of this.  When a no-contact preference is stated by a parent, it must be directly conveyed to the adopted person.  That is not the case with a registered letter.  While we considered the registered letter, we believe direct conveyance of the no-contact preference is the correct way to go. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#R01800","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>We are agreed that there have been lots of variations of this and that the understanding of how best to balance rights has changed and developed.  The problem remains that the mandatory information session strikes many adopted persons as an unduly paternalistic approach.  It is still balanced too much on that side.  It harks back to when the view was taken that we could not give people access to information and there had to be conditions.  It is still a condition on access.  In a previous debate on this, Professor Conor O'Mahony talked about privacy rights trumping identity rights.  It still seems like that is what is happening with the mandatory information session.  We must trust people.  We trust people who receive a court summons by registered post.  There is a point where you have to trust people.  The Minister raised a couple of practical issues around email or registered post.  Those are very easily surmountable because the provision I have set out simply states that the statement of information will go by registered post.  All the other information can go by email or any other means.  It is very easy to get around that problem.  We have other protections for privacy rights.  We have the age limit and the contact preference register.  We have built into this statutory framework other protections and recognitions of that right.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to the two practical points I have raised, which also go to the kernel of the issue about an information session.  First, what if an adopted person does not wish to take the call?  Will they simply not have access to their identity information?  It is a condition on their access and it is not possible to see it any other way.  Granted, it is a much reduced condition compared to what was in previous versions of the Bill.  Second, what happens if there is a dispute or disagreement over what was said in the phone call?  A written statement setting out information, however it is delivered, is far clearer evidence that that information was delivered.  I am concerned that issues could arise around the manner in which information is conveyed in that phone call and the lack of any evidentiary back-up for it.  Those are two issues we discussed in the committee and it was one of the reasons all its members, including Government representatives, agreed on that recommendation.  That is what I am trying to give effect to in amendment No. 199.  I would love to hear the Minister's response to the point that it is this a condition, albeit a more minimal one, and as to what would happen if there were some disagreement over the phone call. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#S00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>I support what Deputy Bacik is saying.  I fundamentally disagree with the mandatory information session.  Even setting it aside from the point of view of principles and what is right, from a practical point of view for the State, having this meeting in preference to a physical letter opens up a whole can of \"he said, she said\".  We all know the idea of registered post is that if somebody signs for it, he or she has received it and if that person does not, it gets sent back.  I do not think there is a responsibility on the State to ensure the person has taken in that information.  Someone could go to a meeting and put his or her hands over his or her ears and not take in what has been said.  If something is sent in a letter and somebody signs for it to say he or she has received it, surely the State's obligation in relation to privacy is fulfilled.  No matter what way it is said, anything else will always be interpreted by people who are adopted as the State being distrustful and saying it knows best.  It is very difficult for anyone to understand it in any other way.  I feel very strongly on this.

We trust adopted people.  That is why they are being provided access to all information.  Nothing is held back any more.  We trust them with the name of their mother, and of their father if it is on record, and the names of all their relatives.  In the past they were not trusted with that.  We trust them and this legislation provides access to that information.  They do not have to sign anything.  There is no criminal prohibition if, having heard the no-contact preference, they decide to ignore it.  There is no consequence set out in this legislation.  I do not believe they will do that but there is nothing there to prevent it because we trust people.  It is right that we are discussing the sense, belief and understanding of the adopted person.  However, we have to recognise there is a set of people - it is a very small set but they are there - and mothers who desperately want to maintain their secrecy.  They exist.  We have to understand that, through this legislation, we will be revealing their names to their children and for a small set of people, primarily women, that will be deeply distressing.  We need to recognise that we are dramatically limiting their privacy rights.  The question is how we ensure that their privacy rights, though limited, are still somehow present in this process.  The State has a responsibility here because, inasmuch as we have a responsibility to provide access to the right to identity, which we are doing under this legislation, an Irish person's privacy right is a constitutional one and the State has to protect that as well.  We have an obligation on both sides to protect rights and we are balancing those two sets of rights.  That is difficult but we believe this is the best way to do that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised concerns about disagreements about what is said and the information.  There is not information in the call.  What the call will involve is the list of points set out in section 17(2).  That is what the call is, and nothing more.  The information will be conveyed separately, either by post or email, after the information session has taken place.  There does not need to be any dispute there because all the designated person is conveying to the relevant person are the points set out in section 17(2).  That will be the end of it.  The information session will then completed and the adopted person will get full access to all information.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bacik also asked about what would happen if an adopted person decided they did not wish to engage with this process.  That is a right.  As I said earlier when the Deputy was not in the room, adopted persons continue to have their rights under the GDPR and can make an application for information under Article 15.  However, the issue there is that Article 15.4 still applies and the balancing that has to be undertaken under the GDPR will still apply.  What is so important about this legislation is that the balancing does not apply.  The adopted person gets full access to all information in all circumstances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#S00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>There are no more contributors and I am conscious of the time.<\/p><p>I will put the question on amendment No. 140.

Instead of those, we will put in:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(b) the fact that&mdash;   \t(i) the parent concerned has exercised his or her entitlement under <i>section 38(11) <\/i>to state that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the relevant person, and <br \/><br \/>(ii) the making of that statement by the parent constitutes an exercise by him or her of his or her right to privacy.  <\/blockquote> <p>There is now no language proposed and the information session will not contain any language where the adopted person is told about the importance of respecting the parent's privacy rights.  It is a further dilution of the information session.  However, I can understand there was a concern that it was seen as paternalistic, particularly in the context of the designated person speaking to an adopted person.  We have sought to improve and address that by the changes brought forward, recognising the importance that the information session has for so many people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYS2022030800002#T00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

The issue of funding of higher education has been a complex one for many years but has come to the fore especially since cutbacks of the last decade, combined with rapidly rising student numbers, and the publication in 2016 of Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education, which hereafter will be referred to as the Cassells report.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that in 2021, Ireland only spent 0.9% of GDP on tertiary education, compared to 1.4% in the OECD.  The ratio of students to teachers in Irish tertiary education is also significantly above both the OECD and EU averages, and has risen dramatically from already unsustainable levels in the past year.  The funding deficit, even aside from anything to do with Covid-19, will get worse in coming years as, mentioned in earlier hearings of the committee, student numbers are expected to rise by almost 30,000 in tertiary education in this decade.  Even without an increase in student numbers over the next decade, the third level budget is 40%, approximately &euro;100 million, off where we were ten years ago, according to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in January 2020.  The Cassells report made clear that &euro;600 million was needed by 2021.  However, we are now in 2022 and little has changed.<br\/><br\/>The European University Association, EUA, has reported that public funding of third level education in Ireland, as a percentage of GDP, fell a shocking 62% between 2009 and 2019.  In the same timeframe, student numbers rose by 28% and staff numbers fell by 8%.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has found that between 2007 and 2016, real expenditure per student at third level education decreased by more than 34% in nine years.<br\/><br\/>The TUI believes that third level education, as part of the social contract, should be funded from Government revenues; that is, from taxation.  Whence that taxation comes is then the issue.  For its part, TUI has made the serious proposal that a 1% levy should be applied to corporation profits to generate a dedicated fund for higher education.  Why, we may be asked, should corporate profits be levied in this manner?  For the very simple reason that to do so is fair and provides those corporations with an opportunity clearly to demonstrate what they claim to have, but what is little in evidence, which is commitment to the society in which they base their enterprise.  These corporations benefit hugely from having available to them a very deep pool of graduate talent in this country &ndash; supplied courtesy of the Irish taxpayer.  In 2015 for example, the levy we suggest would have yielded some &euro;550 million, an investment that would have done very nicely indeed in terms of resuscitating the exhausted and gaunt figure that is the Irish third level education system.  Investment in the further education and training sector also needs to be addressed.  Priorities in the programme for Government can only be adequately addressed if accompanied by additional funding.  Areas such as Youthreach, adult literacy, post-leaving certificate programmes etc. have for too long been a Cinderella of the system.  The committee has acknowledged the need for additional funding of the further education and training sector in its hearings of 1 March.<br\/><br\/>It is important that all institutes of technology have the opportunity to become technological universities if that is the wish of the community concerned.  It is imperative that the two remaining institutes of technology, the Institute of Art, Design and Technology and Dundalk Institute of Technology, are expedited into the technological university sector.  TUI members in both institutes have communicated to management, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, their wish to move towards technological university designation.  This position is supported by the TUI nationally.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is currently being assisted by the HEA in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The HEA has found that 15% of graduates from institutes of technology attended schools participating in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme, compared to just 8% of university graduates, and that 7% of institute of technology graduates attended fee paying schools compared to 13% of university graduates.  According to Richard Thorn, the institutes of technology have 22% of their students registered as flexible learners - part-time, distance and e-learning - compared to 17% for the universities.  The distinction comes in terms of socioeconomic class, in that 31% of students in the institutes come from the non-manual, semi-skilled or unskilled groups compared to 21% in the universities.<br\/><br\/>The TUI would like to make several recommendations to the committee.  The size of SUSI grants and eligibility criteria for same should be significantly expanded.  The TUI welcomes the current ongoing review of SUSI.  Exchequer funding of higher education must be dramatically increased.  This could be partly funded by a one percentage point increase in corporation tax with the proceeds ring-fenced for funding higher education.  Staff-student ratios need to be reduced urgently.  Apprenticeships should have greater support and visibility.  Funding models must take account of the unique role the institutes of technology-technological universities sector plays in higher education access.  Greater recognition of, and visibility of, the further education sector is vital due to the essential role it plays in supporting under-represented groups to access levels 5 and 6 of the national framework of qualifications, and also frequently then accessing levels 7 and 8 of the framework.  Additional staffing of guidance services in schools, further education colleges, higher education institutions and in the adult guidance services would be helpful.  The points system needs to be reformed.  More progression pathways should be recognised.  Additional support in the form of funding and staffing is required for student mental health support services in higher education institutions, HEIs, as well as for employee assistance programmes.  Further funding is required to support access programmes in higher education institutions.  Strong consideration should be made to extending a DEIS-style funding model to the higher education sector.  All institutes of technology, IOTs, should consult staff in relation to seeking a pathway to technological university status.  Emergency remote teaching and learning is, by definition, an emergency response to a crisis situation.  It cannot be seen in any other context.  Additional education needs students should have additional supports maintained if they attend further or higher education after leaving the post-primary system.  Currently when they leave second level, their support is effectively cut off and then needs to be re-established by the relevant further or higher education institution.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, may have a role to play here, especially in the further education, FE, context.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement.  The TUI is more than happy to answer any questions that members may have.  The TUI would also like to direct members to the more extensive written submission that we made to the committee in February, which provides more detail on the issues I have just outlined. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Marjoram"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Marjoram.

I am the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, which is the national student representative body for students in third level education.  Our core mission has always been to protect access to third level education.  At every single opening I give, I must remind people that education is a right and not a privilege.  However, the continual marketisation of education threatens how it is viewed and has only served to heighten existing barriers to third-level education.  I must emphasise how much USI welcomes that future funding of higher education is being looked at and reviewed.  For far too long, many students have been priced out of a third level education and did not get to excel in the ways they should have.  We can certainly change how the future funding of higher education goes, going forward.<\/p> <p>  To fully begin the conversation, we cannot overlook the largest barrier in student access to education, which is the student contribution charge.  We want to see an immediate reduction in the fees, with a commitment to sustainably funding the higher education sector through a publicly funded higher education model.  If we really value our education system so much then we must act on our words. The State must be responsible for funding the system to the levels required to ensure high quality education for all students.  To highlight just how bad it has become, I note that approximately 50% of the funding of Irish universities is private funding.  This is the highest in the European Union and is the second highest in Europe.  According to the OECD, Ireland invests just 0.8% of GDP in tertiary education, which is well below the 1.5% of the OECD average.  How can Ireland prides itself on its education system when it is way below average?<\/p> <p>  In addition, the current student-staff ratio in Ireland is among the highest in the EU, and a minimum investment of &euro;147.48 million per annum is required to bring Irish higher education institutions in line with international best practice of a ratio of 15:1.<\/p> <p>  The USI strongly believes that publicly funded education is the most equitable way to ensure that this increased funding is delivered. The onus should not be on existing or future students to prop up a crumbling sector, rather the State should provide support to the future workforce of our country.  The future expansion of technological universities certainly poses logistical challenges.  As institutes of technology across different geographical locations merge, investment in public transport links is crucial.  Students must be able to access all buildings, resources and supports in campuses across the country.  We must address the lack of public transport infrastructure available in rural areas in particular.  Post merge, technological universities must also be supported, as the entire integration process can take a long time.  They should be supported in building affordable, purpose-built, student accommodation.<\/p><p>Universal design for learning, UDL, played a critical role in online assessment and teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, outside the Covid-19 classroom, UDL serves as an important tool to help combat barriers students with disabilities face in both learning and social environments.  UDL is critical in increasing awareness of barriers to participation and supports that a student may need.  USI believes that the Government should provide funding to higher education institutions for training on UDL principles and guidance on a national framework to try and support colleges to integrate those principles into the entire teaching and learning environment.<\/p><p> Equity of access to higher education is a core component of the work of USI.  Existing financial support structures are not optimal and they are not fit for purpose.  There have been significant cuts to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant over the last decade.  We fully believe that the student grant scheme is a huge opportunity to support students to access education and to progress their entire learning journey.  We welcome the review that is being carried out, but funding must be provided to fully implement the recommendations that emerge.  It is important to note the knock-on effect of a stagnant student grant scheme that is deaf to inflation and higher costs of living.  It affects many people, such as disadvantaged and low-income families, engaging in part-time or full-time employment which may lead to students being unable to complete their studies satisfactorily.  Similarly, international students experience many financial hardships, as they are often seen as cash cows to prop up an underfunded system.  We cannot ignore postgraduate students either.  We must ensure there is a national stipend in line with the living wage for research postgraduates, which would enhance engagement in research and encourage the involvement of more postgraduate researchers of diverse backgrounds.<\/p><p> Finally, I want to touch on student mental health and well-being supports.  Student mental health and well-being is a fundamental element to the overall student experience.  Worryingly, student mental health has worsened in recent years, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We call for the implementation of the recommendations of the student mental health and suicide prevention framework.  Sustainable core funding must be invested annually in support services for student mental health on campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Austick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I am sorry, but I must interrupt Ms Austick.

The congress group comprises a range of unions representing staff across all levels of the sector, including IFUT, the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU and Unite.  It is our view that equal access must be a cornerstone of our education sector as a whole, otherwise we will simply exacerbate divisions and inequality in Irish society.  A 2018 UNICEF report showed that teenage children of lower income parents in Ireland harboured little or no ambition to attend third level.  Meanwhile, a 2019 HEA study revealed that children from affluent backgrounds were ten times more likely to score high CAO points than those from less affluent areas.  An overriding goal of official policy must be to remove all barriers and impediments to access, and the further and higher education sector can play a crucial role in this process.  However, this can only occur if the critical issue of funding is resolved in a sustainable manner, in order to maximise educational opportunity and participation for all.<\/p> <p>  There is broad consensus on the value of investment in higher education and the fact that the returns on the investment are public, political, economic and social.  Indeed, the OECD has pointed out that as countries across the globe respond to the challenges of digital, technological and environmental transition, higher education has become pivotal to progress, given its key role in the formation of intellectual capital.  Similar conclusions were reached by the Nevin Economic Research Institute in research carried out for the congress education sector group.  This stressed the role of higher education as \"a producer of increased skills and capacities in the population, and as a site of research and development\".  The Nevin institute warned that cuts to spending on higher education were self-defeating, as lower investment has a negative impact on long-term growth and living standards.  Given the consensus around this issue, the question arises as to how we have arrived at a situation where we have the highest cost barriers to student participation in the EU and among the lowest spend per student.<\/p> <p>  These barriers include fees and significant increases in the cost of living for students and working families, and in particular the failure to deliver on secure and genuinely affordable accommodation.  The core of the problem lies in the sharp fall in official funding over the last decade.  Thus, between 2012 and 2016, total State funding for higher education fell by almost 15%.  This reduction is in contrast to comparator states, where funding has always been consistently higher.  In 2014, the spend on third level here amounted to 1.1% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of 1.5%.  If we strip out private funding sources, Ireland's public spend on third level was just 0.8%, while the OECD average was 1.1%.  It is now six years since the expert group on future funding for higher education delivered its recommendations and these trends have worsened since then.  In 2019, the Parliamentary Budget Office concluded that funding per undergraduate student - full time, part time, remote and FETAC - was 50% lower than in 2008.  In our experience, the funding shortfall has contributed to a worsening of employment conditions and a rise in precarious work, with research by TASC and NERI strongly suggesting the problem is most acute in the higher education sector.  It has also sparked a creeping privatisation, and a more dominant role for private funding in our universities, a trend that undermines higher education as a public good.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, equality of access must be the cornerstone of our entire education system.  Education is an essential public good and must be funded accordingly.  This includes a properly resourced and publicly-funded higher education sector.  Crucially, this must be accompanied by engagement with all stakeholders, in order to develop a coherent and shared vision for the future of the sector.  Indeed, the necessity for engagement is a key lesson from the experience of the Covid pandemic in the sector.  I stress that this should be the first step, not the last one, once a decision is made on future funding.  The annual cost of attending college has become almost prohibitive and there should be a full reassessment of the grant system to ensure it covers costs and that grants are awarded where they are most needed in a fully transparent manner.  Part-time work and temporary work have a legitimate role at third level, but widespread insecurity of employment will harm teaching and educational standards.  This applies to academic and support staff throughout the institutions, all of whom play a key role in the delivery of education and the proper functioning of the sector.  I thank members for their time.  We are more than happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>IFUT welcomes the opportunity to take part in the discussion on this matter that is of the upmost importance to our entire membership.  IFUT represent thousands of members, all of whom work in higher education.  Our membership includes lecturers, tutors, librarians and researchers.  In our submission to the committee we outlined our concerns in relation to the increased reliance on the sector to secure alternative sources of funding, as the public funding is inadequate.  We referred to reports from the OECD and others that provided statistical evidence to support our case that Ireland is performing badly with regard to publicly funding the higher education sector when compared to others within the OECD.  We must consider why this is the case and make every effort to remedy the situation.<\/p> <p>  Higher education in Ireland has been underfunded for decades.  While Government spending has slowly increased since 2014, the spend per student is still lower than the levels that were in place in 2011.  Then, the State spent around &euro;8,500 per year on each student in higher education, while today that figure is below &euro;8,000 per year.  Currently, we are ranked 20th in the OECD with regard to our spend per student.<\/p> <p>  During the period since 2011, the Irish universities slipped significantly in international rankings.  In the late 2000s, two of our universities were ranked in the top 100 internationally, with one in the top 50.  We now have no institutions in the top 100.  The fall in rankings is directly linked to the reduction in spend.  Cuts to core funding have resulted in a reduction in staff numbers.  The employment control framework of 2010 to 2014 appears to linger across the sector, prohibiting HR departments from recruiting academic staff on the agreed and established contracts.  The most obvious way in which the underfunding manifests itself is through the student to staff ratios across our institutions.  According to the OECD, Ireland's student to staff ratio is at 23.4:1, far out of line with the OECD average of 15:1.  Addressing this ratio must become the number one priority for the Department and for all of us involved across higher education.  In an effort to address the need to have student-facing staff, universities have engaged occasional or hourly-paid lecturers.  This committee must note that these employees are not, in the eyes of the institutions and universities themselves, lecturers, as lecturing staff are defined as those contracted to undertake a range of academic duties encompassing teaching, research, and contribution and scholarly activity.  Given an opportunity, I will expand on this point.  Across the universities, different job titles or terms that are used to describe those engaged in this manner include part-time teaching assistants, part-time assistant lecturers, occasional lecturers etc.<\/p><p>Those engaged in this manner are usually on short fixed-term contracts, only paid for their teaching without any of the other benefits associated with being an employee of a university in a position funded by the State.  Our members in these grades do not have the opportunity to engage in research work.  Being research active is core to the role of a lecturer and the university.<br\/><br\/>Some employers have failed to afford the terms of the public sector agreements to those engaged in this manner.  The precarious nature of their engagement is further compounded by the fact that there is no sectoral engagement on industrial relations, IR, matters across the university sector.  The education oversight group has not met since before the Covid-19 pandemic.  While these workers are represented by trade unions which are members of the ICTU higher and further education group of unions, the employers will not engage sectorally on IR matters, either through the Irish Universities Association, of which they are all members, or through any other employers' umbrella organisation.  Historically, the rationale for the universities&rsquo; refusal to engage on IR matters sectorally was, according to the universities, because to do so would interfere with the institutional autonomy they enjoy as a right, a right that we respect.  However, UNESCO recommendation 20 from 1997 addresses this point.  It states that autonomy should not be used to limit the rights of higher education staff and teaching personnel.  The same document, in recommendation 27, provides that:<\/p><blockquote>\tHigher-education teaching personnel are entitled to the maintaining of academic freedom, that is to say, the right, without constriction by prescribed doctrine, to freedom of teaching and discussion, freedom in carrying out research and disseminating and publishing the results thereof, freedom to express freely their opinion about the institution or system in which they work ... <\/blockquote><p>I ask the committee to consider how a precariously employed part-time assistant lecturer would be expected to exercise this entitlement without any certainty of employment into the future.  We in IFUT know the answer.<br\/><br\/>In IFUT, we believe the failure to fund higher education adequately has given rise to a situation whereby our universities have become over-reliant on precariously employed staff and this has impacted on the quality of our higher education institutions and their global rankings.  We need to address the student to staff ratio by engaging these academics, and others, on contracts agreed through local level or sectoral bargaining.  Failure to address this matter will have a detrimental effect on the sector and society in general.  <br\/><br\/>I thank members for their attention and welcome the opportunity to discuss these points with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am the chair of the Irish Research Staff Association, which represents salaried research staff in higher education.

Studies from Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, Indecon and University College Cork estimate that for every &euro;1 invested in research, society reaps a benefit of between &euro;3 and &euro;5 to the economy.  Research staff bring funding into universities, contribute to internationalisation of higher education, help to inform evidence-based policy and, although this is often under-recognised, contribute to teaching as well.  Strategic investment in research is of benefit to various regions across Ireland and investment in research capacity across our universities, new technological universities, institutes of technology and other higher education institutes, HEIs, across all regions will be a great local, regional and national economic stimulus.<\/p> <p>  Research careers in HEIs are currently characterised by precarity, with research staff generally being employed on fixed-term contracts tied to specific research grants.  The high turnover of research staff within the HEI sector means that experience is often lost from this sector.  Research staff can also end up devoting a significant amount of time to chasing research grants where only a small number of candidates will succeed.  Ireland has a demonstrable track record in producing long-term research, such as the study on which I am employed, the intellectual disability supplement to The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA.  Given this track record, we should avoid precarity becoming part of policy.  <\/p> <p>  Coming from a background in psychology, I am glad to see that mental health is on the agenda.  A systematic review and meta-analysis found that job insecurity is associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.  Precarity reduces the health and well-being of research staff, and their productivity with it.  It harms not only individual researchers but research groups and programmes that have higher levels of brain drain as a result.<\/p> <p>  In order to inform any policymaking decisions regarding research and innovation, it is first important to develop an accurate method of data collection regarding the numbers of research staff, a method that is universal across all HEIs on the island of Ireland.  Data on gender, ethnicity, international or national status, level of seniority and contract type should be tracked over time and should include the career outcomes of the researcher.  Where there are aggregated data, they should be made easily available, to the greatest extent permitted by data protection law.  Research staff should be able to communicate with large numbers of their peers quickly and easily in order to maximise the potential for collaboration and avoid duplication of research effort.<\/p> <p>  In terms of policy, research career frameworks are important for research staff.  A number of policies have been proposed that take an \"up-or-out\" approach, whereby research staff have to progress to a higher level within a relatively short period of time or exit the system.  Why is this problematic?  Let us look at the \"up\" part of the up-or-out approach.  Career progression is good but there is a lack of funding in place for research staff to progress, which means they use increasing amounts of labour hours, paid for by the taxpayer, chasing increasingly competitive grants that they are less likely to get.  Research staff who are generally least able to absorb risk are the ones who take on the bulk of the risk.<\/p> <p>  What about the \"out\" in the up-or-out approach?  Some researchers may wish to stay within a particular role at a given level, drawing on years of experience to perform high-quality research, but risk being pushed out of the system when we take an up-or-out approach.  The higher education research group proposed a funded research framework in the late 2000s.  This is a model we should bring back.<\/p> <p>  A possible solution to enable research staff to continue contributing to academic research is for funding agencies and HEIs to put in place staff scientist positions and equivalent positions for arts and humanities, thereby creating alternative attractive career progression routes within academia.  A report from the National Research Council, for example, recommends raising the salaries of research staff to \"appropriately reflect their value and contribution to research\".  Unless the career prospects for early career researchers are improved, we risk losing the talent that will be essential for our future progress across all areas of research.<\/p> <p>  Alternative career paths, where research staff segue into roles more focused on other areas such as teaching or professional services, are to be encouraged, but they should not be seen as the necessary goal of all research staff.<\/p> <p>  I am here today to advocate not simply for research staff but for a sensible policy of investment that benefits everyone.  Given the return to Irish society evidenced by research, we know that investment in retaining research staff is a win-win.  I look forward to participating further in this process.

I also welcome Alex, who I hope finds this session interesting.  I thank our guests for their opening statements, each of which spoke to what we need to do with the future funding model.  My first question is for Mr. Jones from IFUT.  He highlighted the impact that underfunding has had on the ranking of our institutes of higher education.  In this committee, we have been slow to call out the impact that years of underfunding have had on performance.  We know that because of the work of members of IFUT, other high standards have maintained in extremely difficult circumstances.  However, it is important to accept that even with this great effort, we are inevitably being outperformed by better funded colleges.  The student-staff ratio is much higher here than the OECD average.  That will lead to a very serious impact on education and research output.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Jones also mentioned that the employment control framework extended from 2010 to 2014 and that it is still curtailing HEIs from offering full contracts.  Perhaps we could examine that a little to see why that is the case and ask why, if the framework was to run from 2010 to 2014, it is still having an impact.  We must also consider what is needed beyond adequate funding for the sector and what needs to be put in place to ensure, if and when the Government brings forward a sustainable funding model, that funding is reflected in better working conditions.  The worst thing that could happen would be for us to have a new model but retain precarious working conditions.  We need to make sure we bring change with us.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement on behalf of ICTU, Mr. Byrne mentioned creeping privatisation, which is a very important point.  Privatisation does not always happen in one big sale to a private company.  It can happen, and has happened, over time and we have seen the impact of that.  Do our guests believe we need a step change in how we fund higher education to protect and restore the public nature of third level education?<\/p><p>One of my great fears is privatisation, because it is a quick fix.  We have seen it happen across the board in essential services, including healthcare and housing.  Now we are seeing it in higher education.  How do we collectively stop that?<\/p><p> My next question was sparked by the IRSA's submission.  Over the last ten years, the higher education sector has been underfunded but one exception to this is Science Foundation Ireland.  SFI sets up centres in colleges and works on specific projects or research areas.  Has the SFI model impacted on the working conditions in the higher education sector?<\/p><p> In its submission, the TUI called for a 1% levy on corporation profits to adequately fund higher education.  Is there a specific reason for applying this levy on profits rather than expanding the levy on payroll that currently exists for the National Training Fund?<\/p><p> Ms Austick said the relationship between student accommodation and adequate funding for higher education is vital.  I agree with her on that.  We have not had an update on the student accommodation strategy since 2019 and the housing crisis means accommodation is the single biggest barrier for anyone who needs to travel to third level.  I am concerned about the rising cost of fuel and the impact that will have on those who have been forced to travel long distances.  Do we need a new student accommodation strategy, focused on public ownership and affordability, to go along with the new funding model?  There were a lot of questions there.  Each witness will have about a minute to answer but maybe they can expand their answers later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#D00400","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  The Deputy mentioned rankings.  The student to staff ratio has a direct impact on the rankings but it affects much more than that.  It affects the entire student experience because it affects the ability of lecturers and other staff to deliver on their contracts.  It is very clear that this has a negative impact.  The employment control framework I mentioned was in place for very good reason between 2010 and 2014.  In 2016, Michael Cush SC conducted a review of precarity, short-term contracts and the use of fixed-term and part-time contracts for lecturers in universities.  He made seven recommendations, one of which is that the employment control framework be lifted, allowing the universities the right to hire lecturers directly when necessary, so they would not have to go to the HEA or other organisations for approval.  That is fine and dandy if they have the money to hire but they do not.  That is why they do not hire lecturers but hire these hourly-paid staff on very poor fixed-term contracts of employment and they renew the fixed-term contracts, leaving us with very little option as trade unions-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>If the universities had the funding tomorrow morning, is there anything else that would stop them from doing that?

The problem is that when people such as part-time teaching assistants are employed on these types of contracts repeatedly, they secure permanency in their positions under the fixed-term work legislation but they are permanent in a job they should not really be doing.  They should have the full lecturing experience.  That will make the situation even more dire into the future.  It is a big job.  There is a huge task to be done here, not just in saying that from now on we will have no part-time teaching assistants and will only have lecturers.  I like that the USI has put a figure on the student to staff ratio.  That is important because we need figures and costs to aim for.  It will also take time to tackle this.  ICTU's submission stated that this should be the start of something and I agree with that.  We should not just address the student to staff ratio by putting a load of hourly-paid, precariously engaged teaching assistants into a university because that will not sort anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jones"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":470,"content":"<p>The largest barrier in access to education is the financial cost.  It is not a desire to attend college or awareness of it that is lacking.  It is due to the cost of attending higher education, that is, the cost of student accommodation coupled with the fees, the cost of living and the hidden course material costs.  It is everything together.  The TU Dublin cost-of-living guide estimates that it costs &euro;10,000 to attend one year of college.  It differentiates between people attending college in Dublin, Galway, Cork or Letterkenny.  We need a new student accommodation strategy that commits to tackling the student accommodation crisis in the most effective and efficient manner possible and has short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.  It has to be accompanied by making higher education accessible and reducing the student contribution charge immediately, if not abolishing it.  We want the Government to provide support to colleges to build their own student accommodation that is affordable and based on a cost-rental model.

The Deputy asked me a direct question about privatisation.  ICTU did a report that shows nearly 50% of money is now from the private sector.  There has been a huge drop in public funding from what it used to be.  It was close to 80% or 90% previously.  That is why we are saying this should be the beginning of the discussion.  When the report comes out we would love to come back to the committee and have a discussion because at that stage we can answer the questions on how to deal with what is being put in front of us.  A number of the people here, including us and the representatives from the USI, IFUT and TUI, as well as SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and Unite, are part of Education Futures, the campaigning group we put together to try to deal with future funding.  We had three pillars, which are the metrics by which we should be measuring things when the report from the Department comes out.  The three pillars - access, the quality of the education system, and decent work - set down what we need the future funding model to deal with.<\/p> <p>  The employment control framework does not just deal with academics but with all staff across the system.  Even if a university wanted to hire a security guard, it is set in stone.  That causes problems because if they do not have the funding, they might outsource or bring in a temporary cleaner or security guard.  It is across the system.  The employment control framework is a legacy of the crisis and it must be done away with.  We need to have those discussions across the board on what having more money in the system means going forward and how we deal with it.<\/p> <p>  The USI has given a very clear report on the effects of the accommodation crisis on students and we support it on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I ask for a brief answer on the SFI model and the 1% levy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#E00700","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I am not quite sure I understood the Deputy's question.

As the Chair said, I will have to leave the meeting after this.  I am very impressed with the presentations.<\/p><p>Many of the witnesses speak about access, those on the margins and disadvantage.  We still have an issue in Ireland with functional literacy with 17.9% of our adult population functionally illiterate.  It is something we regularly discuss here.  I suppose the witnesses have all come here looking for money so we need to cut to the chase of what the discussion is really about.<\/p><p> There are a couple of topics regularly bandied around in Irish political discourse.  If it is said in any forum that crime is out of control, most people will nod their heads in agreement.  If anybody rings \"Liveline\" and says \"crime is out of control, Joe\", most people would agree.  It does not matter what kind of international statistics we have about crime in Ireland versus any other country in the world, people would still nod their head and say crime is out of control.  If we say people in Ireland are overtaxed, most people would again nod their heads and say they are overtaxed.  Again, not to disparage \"Liveline\" but the caller to that programme would say \"we are overtaxed, Joe\".  In any pub conversation, political conversation or electoral cycle, people will assume we are overtaxed, despite it not being true.<\/p><p> We need much more maturity in the Irish political discourse and we cannot pretend to invest more in public services, as the delegations are advocating, with zero cost.  They have provided a very reasonable suggestion of a levy on the corporate sector here, raising &euro;550 million.  We made the political argument that to give away &euro;500 million of tax cuts in the last budget, given the state of public finances, was not the right thing to do.<\/p><p> I remember almost 30 years ago being a beneficiary of free education at third level and it opened doors for my family and other families like mine that could enter third level education.  Maybe some doors would have been closed to us otherwise.  Nevertheless, we lost the argument on the idea from the mid-1990s until recently.  The suggestion was made that essentially this was an advantage from which only middle class people would benefit.  The argument was that the funding mechanism should have been funnelled in a different way.<\/p><p> There is no way of adequately funding public services and making them free and excellent, as happens right across Europe, without having a proper discussion about the way we tax and people invest so they can feel proud of their tax system.  They should feel it is a duty and we should get away from the political discourse around every levy and taxation measure.  There is a language around \"tax burden\" and \"squeezed middle\" that always seems to come into the political discourse.<\/p><p> If I am going to nod my head and say the witnesses are absolutely right, as I want to, it would be dishonest of me to say they are right and we must absolutely fund what they want to achieve while telling people during my political campaigning that they are overtaxed.  I do not believe they are.  How do we fix that?  How do we make that political argument and convince the people of Ireland that a fair, transparent and progressive taxation system does not need political buy-off or auctioneering around election time?  Hard questions and choices must be made about how our taxation system produces highly educated and free citizenry.  They are free to make choices and live their lives with an education that has lifted them.  We cannot do that if we still get into the mire of comparing this tax to this levy and the assumption we are overtaxed.  There is also an assumption that public services are not excellent, and that is part of the same right-wing, conservative discussion.  As the witnesses are all seeking money, will they help me out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#E01500","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I might repeat some of what I say now to Deputy Conway-Walsh when she returns.

It clearly has not been nearly sufficient to meet the funding gap.  The Deputy's broader point is correct with regard to the commentary that goes with taxation discussion.<\/p> <p>  In general terms Ireland is not particularly out of line when it comes to income and consumption taxes.  It is out of line with its corporate taxes.  It is why we have focused on a corporate tax levy and a specific levy to take it directly into higher education.

It was commissioned by the Irish Universities Association in 2019 and it deals with the spend on higher education and returns that come to the Exchequer from that spend.  It is a really good investment for the country and it is worth us trying to discuss that and ensure there is value for money and good returns on that investment.  That is what we are about.

We can marry the two of them while also looking at the returns that higher education provides to society in general.  We can also consider the targets being set by the Government.  For example, there is a target of 750 apprentices in the public sector but we do not know where they are going.  There are only 50 live apprentices now in local authorities so even if we put apprentices into the local authority sector, we do not have craft workers with whom they could buddy up.  Who would deal with such matters?  How will we deal with Housing for All and retrofitting?  How will we deal with any of this?  We must invest now because we will also see societal problems down the line.  When politicians have a conversation with people at the door, they should also be saying that if we do not invest now, things will get worse.  If we do not invest now, we will not be able to do what we are suggesting.  We will not be able to build student accommodation or deal with such issues.<\/p> <p>  This is also about societal value.

I am the last man standing.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is coming back in a short while.  The Western Rail Corridor is being discussed in the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication and it is a subject close to her heart.  Deputy Conway-Walsh is keen to continue the discussion on this.<\/p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir as an bhfianaise seo, na f&iacute;ric&iacute; agus an arg&oacute;int.  T&aacute;imse den tuairim go bhfuil cuid mhaith i gcoitiantacht againn.

It is not necessary to repeat it.  From my party's point of view, this is, as Mr. Jones has said, about investment.  This is not only about the individuals who cannot benefit and, indeed, should benefit from third level education.  It is about the value of this to us as a society and, to an extent, as an economy.  I do not want to over-emphasise the latter but it is true as well.  As a society, we need to invest in this.<\/p> <p>  The Cassells report was lengthy but to some extent it stated fairly simply that here is the destination, we need to get to it, there are many ways you can get to it but standing still is not adequate.  The surprising aspect of this discussion is that to a large extent across political parties and organisations, such as Mr. Jones's own, but not limited to it, there is something of a consensus that it should be done through public funding.<\/p> <p>  The view on a graduate tax, a student loan system or anything like that is a minority view as far as I can gather including in the education sector as a whole.  Indeed, many of the third level institutions and some of their leadership have a different view but several of them are also opposed.  To some extent, it surprises me that the suggestion is somehow so resilient that it keeps coming back into the public debate when there are so many voices against it.  I would make that minor point to agree with Mr. Marjoram on some of the taxation inequalities but perhaps the other point relates to social insurance.  We are a bit out of step in social insurance as well in terms of PRSI compared to our European comparators.<\/p> <p>  The general point aside, I have some specific questions for Dr. Allen.  On the issue of career pathways for postgraduate researchers and postdoctoral researchers, there are countries we can look to as doing this better but there are also countries we can look to where this is completely collapsing.  The situation in Britain seems to be adverse for postdoctoral researchers, as far as I can gather, in the precarity that exists.  Perhaps Dr. Allen can correct me, but there is a significant danger there in loss.  I have not come across that \"up and out\" phrase previously but I think I understand what is meant by it.  Can Dr. Allen give me a sense, when the opportunity to progress to full lectureship or a comparable occupation is not there, where is \"out\"?  Where do they go?  Have we any sense of how many postgraduate-postdoctoral researchers are lost to the system?  Perhaps we do not have that information.  If we do, it would be useful to have a sense of the scale of it.  Obviously, the skills involved in their experience and the expertise would be quite considerable.  I agree that there is a significant issue with the funding model.  It is peculiar that much of the funding is State led but still comes in that compartmentalised fixed-round way.<\/p> <p>  For the TUI and Mr. Jones, I am also conscious of the issue of fragmentation of employment and that there would be many people working in the sector who have bits and pieces of contracts - a few hours here and a few hours there.  Is there an element to which the higher education authorities are not prioritising people who are already on the books so that they get more full-time jobs and consolidate their hours?  Mr. Jones also expressed a desire - I will afford him the opportunity if he wishes - to expand on the point that they are not officially classed as lecturers, etc.<\/p> <p>  In response to Ms Austick, the issues with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, are enormous.  There is the issue of the adjacency levels.  It cuts in a number of ways - the threshold to qualify is too low; people on relatively low incomes do not qualify; a large proportion of the people who get grants do not get the full grant; a fairly small proportion gets the full grant; and, in any event, the full grant is not enough to cover costs.  SUSI falls shorts on so many fronts.  I am glad it is being reviewed, but a review is all well and good.  There was a stage where the student contribution was definitely a disincentive but the grant structure and the relevant cost of living was not so serious that large numbers of disadvantaged students or low-income students were put off.  We are now reaching the point, because the SUSI grants are so inadequate, that a significant number of students are facing disincentives of that kind.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Byrne on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I could be wrong on this but I imagine there have been discussions at congress level - I am not sure which trade union would necessarily represent them but perhaps it is SIPTU - about the non-teaching staff, such as the large number of caretakers, grounds staff and carpenters.  Taking caretakers, and probably security as well, for example, many universities are outsourcing these services and privatising them, and some of the terms and conditions are probably under attack.  I would say it is likely to be one of the first areas that universities look at when they are trying to cut costs.  What is the future in relation to that?<\/p> <p>  There is a lot there but I am hopeful that the Chair might be lenient, given that a few others have perhaps benefited from such leniency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#G00400","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I know where everyone else has gone.

They do not accurately reflect the cost of living.  That is one of the big issues.  In previous conversations with the Department, the Minister or other key stakeholders, it always has come down to whether we should have investment in publicly-funded higher education, whether the student contribution charge should be reduced or whether there should be investment in the existing financial support services such as SUSI and the student sssistance fund, SAF.  From our perspective, it should be both.  There has to be the complete abolition of the student contribution charge.  It should be publicly funded.  The sector is so significantly underfunded that the student-staff ratios are not average.  The working conditions are not great for staff.  Students are not getting the best, most meaningful, high-quality education possible because they cannot engage in societies or clubs, or have to work part-time jobs, and have to commute up to four hours each day.  There are so many different scenarios that students experience because of the financial hardship that they are in.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the SUSI and SAF, we are still waiting on the SUSI review to come out to see what has been established and if there will be any financial increases in them.  However, we must look at this in a holistic way.  We must look at the criteria to qualify for the SUSI grant in the first place.  Does one get the full maintenance?  Is it only a portion of it?  Is it only the fees that are covered?  There is the non-adjacency rate as well.  Postgraduate students need support.  International students cannot avail of the SAF or the SUSI grant.  They have no real financial support at all when they come into Ireland and in some instances they pay up to nine times the amount that Irish domestic students do.<\/p> <p>  There is one other point I want to come back on because I just need to say it.  On the argument for a publicly-funded higher education system, you can take the practical economic approach in terms of the investment and what it does for society but there is also the emotive element to it.  Publicly-funded higher education would provide individuals, but also the collective, the opportunity to upskill, to reskill and to participate in lifelong learning encouraging them to constantly strive for more information and knowledge.<\/p><p>It supports society in the context of being creative and thinking outside the box and promotes social justice and equality.  There is also the economic argument whereby for &euro;1 of investment, there will be a &euro;3 return.  There are many positives to a potentially publicly funded higher education system.<\/p><p> This comes back to how we view our education system and whether we see it as a right.  If so, we cannot put a price on it.  Otherwise, we view it as a privilege, although I hope nobody in this room or anybody listening to the meeting thinks that way.  Ultimately, it is a right, not a privilege, and we need to invest in it and ensure that regardless of someone's background, whether he or she has worked or whether he or she wants to attend college or higher education at any stage in life, he or she will have the opportunity to do that.  We need to fund the system.  We need to have a publicly funded higher education system and invest in student accommodation that is affordable, but also ensure the financial supports that are already there are fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Austick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I agree with everything that has been said.   I might come in on the point made by the representative of the Irish Research Staff Association.  It related to a different question, but the Teachers Union of Ireland has negotiation rights on behalf of researchers in the institutes of technology and the technological universities.  It has been a very difficult and arduous path to try to do what we want to do, namely, to improve and standardise the terms and conditions.  What we want are terms and conditions that are directly comparable to those of lecturing staff, that is, the same kinds of contracts, the same level of permanency, the same pension rights and rights to leave and so on.  It has not been easy and, after many years, we have not made the progress we wanted.  There are a plethora of contracts, some of which do not have a pay scale but rather a single point where people stay for however long they remain in employment.  Other than that, there are those who have no pension arrangements made for them whatsoever.  Bizarrely, some of the funding that comes in comes from the funding body with 20% added onto the salary portion for a pension contribution, and that has been sent back in some cases, although we really do not understand why there is such a bureaucratic difficulty in doing anything with that money on the part of the host institution.  We are trying to progress these issues, and while it is not easy to do, our intention is to continue with our negotiations and to try to improve the terms and conditions of researchers to a level comparable with those of lecturing staff.<\/p> <p>  In technological universities, in particular, we want to see an expansion of research capacity, but not a hived-off or separated research activity that is disparate from lecturing.  We think research and lecturing go together, and that is one reason it is a good idea to have comparable terms and conditions in order that there can be interchange and there can be a time in an academic's life when there is a greater focus on one than the other.  The closer together the contracts are, the easier that is to do.<\/p> <p>  There has been some improvement for the sector.  The review of the model in 2019 applied &euro;5 million in funding directly to the sector for the first time.  That was a small sum - the review had recommended 5% as opposed to the &euro;5 million figure, and it will need to be ramped up to 5%, which would be about four times as much - but it has certainly helped with multiannual planning for research and the building of capacity.  That has been positive but it needs to be built on to a far greater extent.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the fragmentation of employment.  To build on what Mr. Jones talked about, TUI was a little ahead of IFUT in gaining the benefits of what he mentioned and of the Cush report.  We met Michael Cush in numerous engagements to try to replicate progress we have made for our teaching grades with regard to far better terms relating to achieving permanency after only two years, as opposed to what is laid out in employment law, where four years has to have passed.  One important aspect of it relates to the augmentation of contracts after a single year of holding additional hours.  I think that was the point that was being made.  We should not have people in the system who are not turned to for additional hours that become available.  We are adamant that is what should happen.  We have an agreement and a circular letter that states that should happen, but there remain implementation difficulties and it is something we are concerned about.  The Cush process, like many of these trade union processes, arose out of industrial action and, frankly, out of saying enough is enough.  Nevertheless, we got something positive and it has improved matters, and we are still working to try to make it as effective as possible by following precisely what was laid down in the circular and the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Marjoram"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I might address the question on support staff.  I look after predominantly administrative staff in the technological universities, the IOTs and the ETBs.  We got that name changed to professional, managerial and support staff, PMSS, because it was a big bugbear for our members that there were academic and non-academic staff, which in itself suggests the latter were more important.  Much of what has gone on since the austerity years, and is still continuing citing the ECF, relates to specific-purpose contracts, and there is an awful lot of outsourcing of agency staff because of the ECF.  Trying to establish the extent of the cost being incurred by the employer was difficult and, as members can imagine, it was quite expensive compared with direct labour, which is what we are advocating for.  Under fixed-term contracts, members who worked tirelessly had some security under the legislation whereby after four years, they could become permanent and have security of tenure, whereas in the case of specific-purpose contracts, they did not.  There is an awful lot that has to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  By May, five TUs will have been established.  This is an exciting time for many students who, in the first instance, would not have had access to the universities but now they do, at world-renowned institutions.  It is important that rather than throwing money at the issue, there should be engagement with the relevant stakeholders, including all staff and us representing the members, to see what to do.  I am an advocate of the idea that if you want to know how to do a job, you should ask the people who do it.  Let us slow down and get this right.  Let us carry out due diligence that will make us proud.  Many rural institutions were set up because of local socioeconomic factors and afforded an opportunity for students to gain access to third level, and now they have university status.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked how we can make this political argument.  I do not think there is one person in a household who would not advocate for his or her student children to get the best opportunity possible.  We have that now with these TUs.  We need to fund them in such a way that Ireland can be proud and the students who qualify will receive recognised, world-renowned university degrees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022030800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Stella Griffin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>To return to Ms Griffin's point about professional, managerial and support staff, I am the sector organiser at SIPTU for the education sector, so I represent everyone from professors all the way down to cleaners at the universities.

Ms Griffin hit the nail on the head.  The outsourcing happens at the lowest level, where institutions feel they can implement it.  It happens at the levels of security, caretaking and cleaning.  In the university sector, the majority of those roles are outsourced.  The best example of where that is not done is at Trinity College, and I think the benefit of that can be seen there.  Outsourcing is about saving money, not having to deal with various issues and so on.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, due to the ECF, if additional people are needed, there is the question of whether they will be taken in on fixed-term contracts, through an agency or whatever the case may be.

They are planning out the entire career of researchers through the seven points in the researchers career framework.  When a researcher eventually reaches point 7, there is termination.  A researcher can spend 15 years on a series of contracts and the employer's plan is to get him or her to point 7, where there is termination.

To reference a specific example from the UK, Bristol University has followed a really good model for a number of years that features tracks.  There is a research track whereby staff can go further in their careers up to research professor level.  In Ireland, most of the time people are trying to segue from being a post-doctoral researcher to a lecturer.  They often change.

I do not want to be the spoilsport, but I am asking a very serious question.  Different sectors and organisations are coming with a begging bowl looking for money.  The witnesses are experts in the educational field.  That is why they are before us today.  Why is the higher education sector more important than, for example, saving the life of a person who is suffering from cystic fibrosis, or whatever it might be, in an acute hospital?  They are the questions that I am asked if I am in a radio debate.  I do not think there is anybody that does not want more funding for education, but there are so many asks out there.  While it is a spend, it is an investment for the future to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, and everything like that.<\/p> <p>  I have been a huge advocate for the South East Technological University, SETU, looking at the geography of the south east and where we are located in County Wexford.  We have been told by IDA Ireland that one of the reasons that we cannot attract FDI to Wexford and the south east is because we do not have a third-level education facility.  That is particularly true in respect of County Wexford, and less so in respect of counties Waterford and Carlow.  Now we have ticked that box.  We have the infrastructure and the roads and everything like that.  We have bypasses straight into Enniscorthy and fantastic infrastructure.  I will be after the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Government in general, looking for investment for infrastructure into the all the campuses of the SETU, including the campuses in Carlow, Wexford and Waterford.  It is really important because we are behind in the south east.  The number of people who do their leaving certificate and do not go on to further or higher education but go straight into the workplace is absolutely staggering.  How do I make that argument?  I am not just saying that it is an investment.  There is something behind it as well.  I mentioned the idea of attracting FDI.

One thing, for instance, is that we certainly do not want the TUs to lose the really strong grip that they had on the teaching and learning side and the very strong relationship we had with the students.  On the Chairman's basic point, if we look at our own history, what has lifted this country is education.  It has been well expressed here in terms of that investment.  Would we have gotten anywhere near where we are but for very progressive decisions that were made regarding second level education 50-odd years ago?  We would not.  We would still be scrabbling around with a very poor economy.  None of the things that the Chairman rightly pointed to, such as proper healthcare and housing, are achievable without that base of education that generates the kind of economic activity and the kind of society that lifts us all.  That is the very strong point.  TUs give us an opportunity now to do better with regard to those who have not been coming to third level previously, to improve the pathways from further education into third level and into a qualification that is viewed on a par with a third-level qualification, and that adds that value to the local community.  That is one great thing about technological universities, which the Chairman highlighted, is their regional remit and the fact that they can lift the region around them.  There is very strong evidence, and it has been pointed to previously, that every euro spent on education multiplies in a local community.  For example, I saw a study on Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which was scoring highest on this.  Every euro spent was bringing &euro;6 along with it.  That is the argument.

However, there is also the other side of the argument.  How do we get the medical professionals into the field?  At this moment in time, discussions are ongoing.  We are engaging with the universities and institutes and telling them that we do not want a repeat of situation that occurred last year, which we knew had to happen because of Covid, where extra places had to be put into the system.  If extra places are put into the system, they need to be planned and looked at.  The Department is telling us that we need more medical students going into the system.  That means that we need more labs and bigger lecture theatres, or we need to roster them differently.  To provide the extra medical professionals for the hospitals, we need to invest to ensure that we have quality.  I listened to the meeting of the committee a few weeks ago when the employers, such as the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association, were in.  They were saying the same thing.  We have got to a place where quality has not been affected.  That has involved putting many shoulders to the wheel.  However, quality will be affected if we do not invest in this regard.  We had situations, during Covid, where we had overflow rooms for lectures because we could not fit everyone in the same room.  We had to extend the number of lab sessions that we had because there were pinch points around restrictions to numbers in a lab or training session.  Those are aspects of the Chairman's question.<\/p> <p>  I raised an issue related to housing.  How do we get the apprentices into the system?  We currently have the highest number of registrations that we have have ever had.  We have a backlog that we are working through very quickly and, hopefully, will be cleared by the summer.  We have engaged constructively with the FET stakeholders.  We and the TUI have done that at all levels to ensure that backlog is dealt with.  However, the questions remain.  How do we deal with Housing for All?  How do we deal with retrofitting?  How do we deal with those areas?  We need to invest.  This is where the societal question arises.  As a politician in the D&aacute;il, the Chairman is being asked about healthcare and housing.  That is where we are looking at all the parts that bring us to the point where we have the person in health to provide healthcare and the builder in construction to build the house that we want built.

In fairness to the committee, I have seen some of its comments on access and making sure people get into the system.

We are joined from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, and Mr. Stewart Logan, senior planning adviser.  Ms Lisa Clifford, from the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, section of the Department joins us remotely.  From the Department of Rural and Community Development we are joined remotely by Mr. Fintan O'Brien, assistant secretary; Mr. Eddie Forsyth from the rural fund and corporate support unit; and Mr. J.P. Mulherin, from the rural programmes and policies unit.  We have circulated the opening statements to the members.<\/p> <p>  I will outline what the committee has done so far.  We have had a series of meetings.  We agreed to discuss dereliction and vacancy and a number of related areas such as compulsory purchase order, CPO, transport-orientated development and how we can bring life and vitality to rejuvenate our towns and villages.  In this fourth meeting we will discuss another important aspect, that of central government funding to support policies such as Town Centre First and Our Rural Future and also to support many of the measures that are outlined in the Housing for All strategy.  Central government funding is critical to that.  We recognise that not all funding for our towns and villages will come from central government.  There will also be private investment and they will all work together to regenerate.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted the witnesses have joined us.  I and other members are former local authority members.  The URDF and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, announcements are always a time of great interest and excitement at local authority level because they have done some fantastic work out there.  We have all seen that in our constituencies in the few years since the funding was introduced.<\/p> <p>  I will ask the witnesses to make their opening statements and members will then be invited to address questions to them.  We will limit it to seven minutes for each interaction involving questions and answers.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in the public meetings.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limits to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings as a person who is physically present in the Leinster House complex does.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements will be available on the Oireachtas website after the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to witnesses for the late start to the meeting.  We had a vote in the Chamber and then a roll call was sought on that vote which delayed us all.  Some members are still in the Chamber, but they will join us when they finish there.

As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by Ms Lisa Clifford, principal officer in the URDF section, and Mr. Stewart Logan, senior planning adviser.<\/p> <p>  As members have the full statement which contains some examples, I might just focus on the key points now.  Since our last appearance before the committee, the Government has launched the Town Centre First policy, which provides an important enabling framework for the development of towns.  While towns face many challenges, there are also many opportunities to reimagine and revitalise many areas.  A number of structures are being put in place to lead and support this initiative, which is fundamentally about enabling towns and their communities to define the vision for the future of their town.  We are working with colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development to implement this policy.<\/p> <p>  For towns with populations of over 10,000, the URDF provides an important source of funding to realise these ambitions.  The URDF is one of the four funds launched in 2018 as part of Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, and is specifically focused on implementing the national planning framework and that alignment of special and investment plans to deliver on a timely basis the investment required to provide the housing, jobs and infrastructure of the present and future population which is likely to increase by 1 million by 2040.<\/p> <p>  The URDF has proved to be a game changer in the promotion of co-ordinated investment in the renewal and redevelopment of cities and towns.  Under the NDP review published last year, a commitment was made to extend the time of the fund from 2027 out to 2030.  It is a &euro;2 billion fund and there will be an associated additional investment for that extra period.<\/p> <p>  There have been two calls to date.  Over &euro;300 million was allocated to 87 projects in call 1.  Many of these were master planning and initial kick-off projects.  A total of 45 projects got &euro;1.3 billion in funding approved under call 2.  There were some delays to project roll-out because they were impacted by the Covid-19 construction restrictions.<\/p><p>Activity is now increasing and we expect the build to increase significantly in the coming years.<\/p><p> I will focus on cities and towns, in particular.  Many of the very high value projects have been approved for metropolitan areas.  They are projects of significant scale.  In total &euro;1.286 billion has been approved for metropolitan areas and key driver towns.  Some examples, such as the Cork docklands, are set out in the statement.  It would be true to say that both the nature and the scale of the projects and the funding approach are transformative.  It provides an integrated, dynamic and responsive way to underpin the national planning framework with a particular focus on compact growth.  The approach brings together a number of strands of public investment, such as transport and water services, to deliver an overall integrated urban development proposal.  As the Chairman said, the projects deliver new energy, new life and opportunities for economic activity and residential development in parts of cities with high levels of dereliction, under-use and a need for transformative change.<\/p><p> In addition, &euro;330 million has also been approved for projects in towns under the URDF to date, supporting a wide range of projects which are catalysts for change.  Again, a couple of examples are set out in the statement as an illustration.  The Department has been very impressed by the richness and diversity of projects put forward by local authorities under the URDF.  We have supported the application stage through the hosting of workshops, including one hosted by the IDA, given the importance of place making to the economic vibrancy of towns and the offering they can make in enterprise and employment terms.  <\/p><p> In regard to the funding approach, projects are initially examined by a project appraisal board which is chaired by the Department and by Ms Clifford, who is with us.  That comprises a range of funding Departments and external expertise.  This is a very useful step in ensuring proposals meet the fund criteria and provide additionality to other funding streams.  As set out in the NDP review and reflecting our experience to date, the next rounds of funding will separately target cities and towns given the different needs and scales of projects.  The next call will be for projects in towns later this year and it will align with the Town Centre First policy launched in February.  The criteria will also specifically identify the tackling of vacancy, as outlined in Housing for All and Town Centre First to encourage the activation of vacant properties.  The Department will also move from a competitive call basis, which was a feature of the funding to date and was important in the early stage, to now work with local authorities to bring the next generation of projects forward and ensure a steady pipeline of suitable projects.  It will also ensure there is a good spread geographically of those projects, particularly in the light of the Town Centre First plans that will be emerging in towns around the country and to ensure the activation of residential development in strategic areas.<\/p><p> The combination of policies through Town Centre First reflecting the objectives of the national planning framework, matched with substantial funding available through the URDF, gives a real opportunity to deliver improvements to the liveability of cities and towns and make a real difference to the social and economic sustainability and development.  We are happy to take any questions that committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their invitation to the meeting today.  I understand the committee is holding a series of meetings relating to urban and rural regeneration, so we are happy to be here today to discuss our Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the rural element of that discussion.  I am joined today by two colleagues, Mr. J.P. Mulherin and Mr. Eddie Forsyth, both of whom are principal officers in the Department of Rural and Community Development with responsibility for policies and schemes which are of direct relevance to the matters being discussed by the committee.<\/p> <p>  As a starting point for the discussion I am sure the committee members are aware that Our Rural Future, the national rural development plan for 2021 to 2025, was published last year.  The policy clearly recognises that not all rural areas are identical and that individual towns, villages and parishes differ significantly.  Our approach to rural development and regeneration must take account of this reality.<\/p> <p>  The policy also sets out the challenges and opportunities that face rural Ireland and includes a range of actions for delivery over the period of the policy which aims to deliver on the policy&rsquo;s stated vision of a thriving rural Ireland which is integral to our national economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being and development.  The policy also recognises the interdependence of urban and rural areas, the centrality of people and the importance of vibrant and lived-in rural places.  The policy importantly provides a framework for the significant level of current and future investment in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  From this Department&rsquo;s perspective the main elements of this funding which will be of relevance to today&rsquo;s discussion with the committee are contained in the rural development investment programme, RDIP.  The schemes included in that investment programme are the EU co-funded LEADER programme, which has been successfully implemented in Ireland over 30 years; the CL&Aacute;R programme, which has been launched this year with a &euro;7 million budget and which provides funding for small scale infrastructural projects in certain designated rural areas; the local improvement scheme, which has a budget of &euro;11 million in 2022 to support the improvement of non-public roads in rural communities and improve access to rural farms and homes; the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, which has also recently been launched for 2022 with a budget of &euro;15 million; the town and village renewal scheme, which will be launched shortly for 2022 and will include support for streetscape enhancements and key priorities such as the development of remote network facilities, the regeneration of disused buildings for community use; and the Rural Regeneration Development Fund, RRDF, which to date has delivered funding of &euro;278 million over a total of 191 projects.<\/p> <p>  I understand that the town and village renewal scheme and the RRDF may be of particular interest to members of the committee in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion and we would be happy to provide any further detail required on these two schemes.<\/p> <p>  The town and village renewal scheme and the RRDF are also closely linked to another recent policy development which Ms Graham mentioned, namely, the publication of the Town Centre First policy.  This policy was developed jointly by the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and drew on the input of a wide range of expert stakeholders in its development.  The policy sets out to address many of the issues which the committee may have been discussing in its recent deliberations and it includes a range of 33 actions which seek to tackle issues such as vacancy and dereliction and to give our towns the tools and resources they require in order to regenerate themselves as viable and attractive places in which people and families can live, work and run a business.<\/p> <p>  As referenced at the beginning of my remarks, no two rural areas are identical and the Town Centre First policy clearly recognises the role of locally led town teams in developing plans that recognise their own circumstances, challenges and opportunities.  The initial financial supports are in place to support the roll-out of the Town Centre First policy, for example, funding has been provided for the first tranche of 26 towns to develop their own Town Centre First plans and arrangements are currently being finalised to put in place the local town regeneration officers who will play a key co-ordinating and leadership role in local authorities throughout the country and for establishing the national delivery structures that will ensure momentum and coherence in implementation of the policy.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that my opening remarks represent a very brief overview of some of the key areas of intervention by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  My colleagues and I will be very happy to answer any questions that members of the committee may have and to provide any further detail which may be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fintan O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.

We are delighted they are contributing to our consideration of urban and rural regeneration.  I will focus my initial round of questions on the urban.  Hopefully I will get an opportunity to come back in later.  We have a strict time limit.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the &euro;1.286 billion in URDF funding, I agree it has the potential to be a game-changer.  The north inner-city in Dublin Central was fortunate, and it was deserving, to get approximately &euro;120 million of the funding announced under it for important projects, such as the fruit and vegetable market in Dublin 7, the national monument on Moore Street, the Moore Street market, Parnell Square, the city library, Mountjoy Square and the Five Lamps.<\/p><p>It is a fantastic way for the State to be investing.  I would argue that it is long overdue and it is certainly more than a decade overdue.<\/p><p> I cannot let the witnesses out of here today without saying that there is huge frustration and disappointment that we are a year on from the announcement and I see very little evidence on the ground of the city council actually using those funds.  I will use the fruit and vegetable market as an example.  Not only is that a spectacular and purpose-built market building.  If we were to try to set out today to build such infrastructure, the craftsmanship would be very hard to replicate.  It is in great condition but we are not seeing any evidence of development.  Millions of euro have been dedicated and given to Dublin City Council to reopen that market.  I have a list as long as my arm of people who would go in there and reanimate it.  This list includes everything from fresh food producers to cooked food producers and artists.  How can the Department trigger the local authority to use those funds?  How can the Department find out where is the bottleneck with the local authority?<\/p><p> It is a similar situation with residential properties in the north inner city.  We have talked about the Town Centre First policy, and Housing For All has clearly called out the need for us to use and reuse existing building infrastructure.  There is no more sustainable way to increase our housing stock than to use the housing stock that is already built.  This is not happening.  Dublin City Council has had a vacancy officer since 2017.  The council, however, had a pitiful track record in this regard when council officials came in to speak with the committee about tackling dereliction and vacancy in the city.  What can the Department do with the local authority to support them to actually open up those properties?  The city is coming down with people looking for affordable homes.  The city is coming down with people who are just looking for homes.  Yet, we have endless vacancy and dereliction in the city.  What can the Department do to support the local authority?  The Department is clearly providing the funds but something more is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#F00500","speaker":"1656","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>There are a couple of issues.  The important aspect, in addition to giving the investment and the opportunity for investment, is about driving the programme.  From the Department's perspective, all of these projects were given the funding and the local authority is in the driving seat as the sponsor.  We have put in arrangements within the Department and we will be meeting local authorities regularly.  I will ask Ms Clifford to come in on that in a moment.  We have expanded our planning and advisory team with Mr. Logan in order that we will have advisers who would be dealing with all the different areas of the country.  Part of this is to give that support and monitoring, from the Department's point of view, to see that drive.<br\/><br\/>It must be acknowledged also that there has been a Covid effect.  While some housing projects, for example social housing projects, were able to continue if they were at a certain stage during construction shutdowns, the nature of the urban regeneration and development fund projects was that they were shut down if they were at construction stage.  This has had a knock-on effect.  We are moving very much into the mobilisation phase as well.<br\/><br\/>From a broader perspective and the actions in Housing For All around vacancy nationwide, the vacant homes officers are becoming full-time.  The Senator referred to Dublin being one of the areas that has had full-time vacant homes officers.  Again, from the supporting and driving perspective, the Department is establishing its own principal officer-led vacant unit, to bring together many of the aspects the committee has spoken about including the investment, regulation and funding, to have a co-ordinated approach.  The Housing Agency is looking at supporting local authorities with advice through the agency's procurement unit, and through its compulsory purchase system expertise.<br\/><br\/>The final piece we will be working on from a national planning framework perspective is city delivery boards, under Project Ireland 2040.  At present, we have a national Project Ireland 2040 delivery board that has all of the Secretaries General of the funding Departments, who are now external members.  There will be city development boards for Dublin and for the other cities that will bring the national board to the city level and will really focus on ensuring there is integration of the spatial plans and the investment.  Some of these are very big projects that can be dependent on a lot of big public investment in transport and water, as well as the mobilisation of the projects.<br\/><br\/>The other leg is that we are working with the County and City Management Association, CCMA,<font color=\"#3C4043\"> <\/font>around resourcing of local authorities.  Mr. O'Brien has touched on some of the resourcing and the town regeneration offices funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  There is a wider resourcing issue of planning and town regeneration.  We want to get to the heart of that to see what the numbers are and what the skills are, and how we can make sure that local authorities are set up for the future.  There is a commitment in Housing For All to make sure that the planning resource is funded.  There are a couple of elements there.  Perhaps Ms Clifford will talk a little bit about how we engage with Dublin City Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":546,"content":"<p>As Ms Graham has said, following the announcements and the issuing of the initial approval letters with the local authorities last year, Mr. Logan and I and our teams have just come out of a long series of meetings with every local authority around their urban regeneration and development fund projects to ascertain where the projects are and where difficulties are arising.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Dublin north inner city project, it is a hugely complex project and especially because it is made up of 15 different parts, all of which are moving at different speeds.  We are working with Dublin City Council to see how best we can move forward the parts of the project that can move more quickly.  The pieces such as the library, which the Senator referred to and is a longer-term project, are a bit more complex and will take that little bit longer to get through the various stages of the public spending code.  The exercise we carried out with all of the local authorities was to critically look at the different elements of the projects to see where we can move things forward more quickly.  This is certainly something we will be following up with Dublin City Council, in the context of its projects.  From the Department's perspective, the Dublin north inner city project is one of our largest and we have a particular interest in making sure that these projects get on the right track, particularly the larger and more complex projects.

In terms of the URDF, I welcome the investment in my own area. Tandy's Lane Park opened in the summer and it is a direct result of the URDF funding stream.  Airlie Park in Adamstown is under construction at the moment.  We are all eagerly awaiting it being opened, hopefully later this year.  As referenced in the opening statements, Clonburris has also received quite a significant injection of funding.  While it is welcome, it is absolutely and utterly needed.  It is a basic requirement because these are massive growing areas.  They are very large-scale strategic development zones.  As we are talking about an influx of thousands of families into the area, we need the services and the amenities to come on stream and be delivered hand in hand with housing.  I am really glad that the URDF is there to help make that happen.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly interested in Ms Graham's point about the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.  It is great to hear of the hiring of staff, and indeed support staff, that is happening in the area.  Obviously, it is going to take teams of people to help tackle the issues that my colleague referred to in terms of dereliction and vacancy.  Vacancy is just one of the key focuses that we have had in Fine Gael.  Senator Cummins, who sends his apologies today, and I launched a discussion document on dereliction and vacancy and urban and rural renewal.  At this stage, we have had three different successful provincial meetings to reach out to stakeholders, including local authorities, Tidy Towns groups, chambers of commerce groups, and many people who have a vested interest in ensuring that we are transforming derelict and vacant properties into used spaces and family homes.  There have been three really welcome updates in the last few weeks, including that on the vacant homes officer and the announcement of the increase of funding to &euro;60,000.  The idea that these are all going to be full-time positions, or at least full-time equivalent positions, in each local authority in the country shows the commitment and the focus that there is going to be in every local authority up and down the country in this regard.  In respect of the announcement of the new grant of &euro;30,000 for people who want to purchase a vacant or derelict building and to transform it, I note the Minister has announced his commitment to making sure that this happens.  In terms of the ministerial regulations, we have also seen in the past few weeks the change of use rules that will now make it so much easier to have above-pub dwellings, as it were.  People no longer have to go through a lengthy and complex planning procedure.  Homes can be delivered above pubs without a change of use being required.  That is something that is really welcome, particularly in rural Ireland, where, unfortunately, we have seen pubs go to dereliction.<\/p> <p>  We need to see more progress being made in targets.  Local authorities still do not have targets, at this stage, for the repair and lease or buy and renew schemes.  These are schemes that we know are proven to work in terms of taking derelict and vacant properties and transforming them into houses.  That is what we want to do.  We want to unlock that potential.<\/p> <p>  From a living cities perspective, one of the initiatives that we spoke about previously was perhaps extending that to new areas that might need rejuvenation.  I would be particularly keen to hear Mr. O'Brien's views on that.  Overall, there is a sense that we need to reform and modernise the Derelict Sites Act.  Mr. O'Brien is probably the most expert witness in that area.  Perhaps he could comment on the extension of the living cities initiative and the reform of it.  I ask Ms Graham to talk me through the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board, what it looks like, how it is going to be monitored, how progress is going to be measured and how it is going to be reported out.

For example, we would have had sector presentations on education, transport, housing and water services.  It is really to bring that to the city level, so that if there are particular blockages, they can be looked at in the wider metropolitan area and not only in one authority.  That is the concept that we are developing.<\/p> <p>  We are reviewing the derelict sites - it is within my area - to see if there are any kind of improvements that we can make to the working of the legislation as it is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham.

It acts as a stimulus as well, if the local authority invests in the local town or creates this nice place.<\/p> <p>  I was glad to hear Ms Graham mention place making in her opening statement.  I was at a presentation by IDA Ireland at the Irish planning conference many years ago at which it was said that this principle of place making is so important for people who want to invest, not only local investment but for foreign direct investment as well.  Companies that want to invest in Ireland - it does not matter if you have the best broadband and the best industrial estate - want nice places for the families that go with those jobs.  Place making is incredibly important and this can help towards it.<\/p> <p>  Where the local authority invests in it, and it might create that stimulus for a private building owner who wants to develop over-the-shop or a derelict site, it is my understanding that the regulations around this are quite cumbersome.  I will direct this question to Mr. Logan as it is probably planning related.  We have got the planning exemption for certain developments but the process for the fire safety certificate, the accessibility certificate and the section 57 certificate for the certification at the end of it seems to involve quite an onerous number of hoops somebody has to jump through.  What has being suggested to me is that where it is a small development of maybe two or three apartments above the shop, the expense that goes with that process is disproportionate to the overall conversion or refurbishment project.  Do we need to look at streamlining certain regulation processes around development in order to maximise the local authority's investment in that town as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#J00900","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":576,"content":"<p>It is important to say there is a review under way of Part B under the fire regulations by colleagues in the Department.

That is under way currently.<\/p> <p>  The exemptions the Chairman referred to have been quite successful.  From 2018, we have had 300 or 400 of these properties that have moved.  That is very much market based and a response to what might be considered a relaxation of or, more correctly, flexibility in the planning regulations, specifically, as the Chairman said, for those typical properties that are above shop on the main street where there are vacancies that have not moved into residential.  They have been quite successful.<\/p> <p>  There possibly is a piece around the co-ordination within the local authority, which holds much of the statutory code piece in that regard.  There may be a co-ordination piece there that could perhaps achieve more results around those properties and bring them into residential use.  It is a co-ordination piece that is responsive to where there are those properties that perhaps individuals or landowners are interested in developing and I suppose the local authority sector perhaps allocating more resources, more particularly, to assisting those in bring those into a residential use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stewart Logan"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I am interested to hear that.

That is helpful to know.<\/p> <p>  On the dereliction, would a dereliction tax work better than a dereliction levy?  There was &euro;5 million levied on derelict sites and derelict buildings owners in 2020 by local authorities but they collected less than &euro;400,000 - a less than 10% collection rate.

There is a spectrum.  In the context of the gathering of information for the local property tax, LPT, one of the issues that is being looked at is a tax on vacant properties.  Obviously, the scope and what that would include would be important.<\/p> <p>  From the data we have got from local authorities, many issues around dereliction are to do with ownership and the capacity to activate is quite difficult.  You need a number of tools in your armoury to deal with that.  Many of the local authorities have been quite successful in issuing compulsorily purchase orders, CPOs, on the property because then one can more readily assure it comes into active, and particularly residential, use.  The Housing Agency is developing guidance on issuing CPOs on property.  That is a particular area that we are looking at, not only for social housing needs and for affordable housing needs, but also for market-based housing.<\/p> <p>  Taxation plays a role.  Obviously, we are looking at that.  We will have the residential zoned land tax.  That is looking at the sites.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance is examining the property tax and consideration is being given to what the extent of that would be.  Beyond penalisation of holding the property, we also need incentives to activate the property.  That is probably where our focus is at the moment.  The more derelict a property is, the more risky it is to bring it back in.  The question is whether there is a role for local authorities or the Housing Agency to revamp the project and then put it to the market.  <\/p><p> One of the other sources of funding that has not yet come on stream but is being worked on is the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, which the regional assemblies are looking at.   In particular, they are looking at gaps where there may not be other funding streams.  Hopefully, that will be finalised in the second quarter of this year.  They are looking at the issues of vacancy and dereliction.  Mr. Logan will have had a lot of conversations with them.

Project Ireland 2040 sets ambitious targets and goals for making Ireland a better country for all.  I like that &quot;for all&quot;.  We tended not to have the same distribution across the country.  I also see echoing through the statements today local and regional ambition and, ultimately, national impact.  It is going to take time but I acknowledge it and can see the work.  I have been on this committee previously and I know we have repeated many issues.  Everything is slow.  As Ms Graham rightly said, we have had Covid and other issues.<\/p><p>The Waterford North Quays project is amazing and highly ambitious.  It has had some setbacks and bad publicity in respect of parts of it not going ahead.  I am aware &euro;81 million was set out in ERDF funding for that phase of the projects.  The officials might let the committee know more about that, if not today then at some point.<\/p><p>The other recurring issue is resources.  Somebody just mentioned compulsory purchase orders.  The local authorities will tell us that they have no funding for compulsory purchase or for the protracted litigation that goes into all of these issues.  The officials might address that.  Ms Graham talked about resources into the future but we need to hear about resources now.  We need to see tracking, timelines and delivery.<\/p><p>One of the biggest issues of concern is that of the local authorities themselves.  I know these are areas Ms Graham covers; I apologise that I am directing all my questions at her.  The local authority declaration of vacant properties is an extraordinary document.  I have had opportunity to look at one and have seen properties omitted from it.  It has been raised with me by councillors that certain properties are not included.  How verifiable and accurate is that list?  Where I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the local authority is presiding over dereliction in many parts.  There are substantial sites with major town centre zoning that have been derelict for up to 20 years.  It is extraordinary.  I took the time early this morning to walk around these properties again to double-check if there had been a miracle since I was there last week but nothing has changed.  They put up their hands and say the chief executive wants this and that and we might have social housing.  It is crazy stuff.  Some of these are protected structures so that is a challenge.  They do not all have to remain protected structures, however.  There is a process of delisting.  I would not encourage this but in some cases protected structure status may not be warranted.  That is not something I like to talk about too often as I am very committed to protected structures and our built heritage.  <\/p><p>I do not know if any of the officials read an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by Darragh Bermingham recently.  Councillor Annemarie Ryan Shiner in County Tipperary raised the article.  She acknowledged the great work the Heritage Council has done on the collaborative town centre health check.  When is that going to be rolled out across every local authority?  It works; people are speaking about it and it appears to be very successful.  I would like the officials to talk about that.<\/p><p>We are talking about vacancies and dereliction today.  Some of the harbour port companies are presiding over massive dereliction of viable and nice property in major areas where people would want to live and do business.  We have the Office of Public Works.  There are two Garda stations in close proximity to me, in Dalkey and Kill of the Grange, that have been empty for nine and ten years.  We know there needs to be co-ordination on issues.  We need to look at the Defence Forces, dare I say it.  There are very substantial lands out in Thornton Hall.  What are we going to do with them?  Who is going to go out there?  Can we do property swaps?  We have to be realistic and look at that. <\/p><p>I have asked enough questions.  There are some issues.  I am concerned with the power the Department is investing in local authority officials, not in the councillors but in the officials.  They have had this for a long time.  I ask the officials to look specifically at the properties that are under the ownership of local authorities and to come back to us in three months with a detailed report.  We need to ask these city and county managers what is going on here.  It is very important that the vacant housing officers should be full time.  It should not be a matter of chief executives moving people around buildings and calling them a bit of this and a bit of that.  We want full-time vacant housing officers and town centre offices.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  There are really important initiatives happening here and I commend all those involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#K00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I will try to get through as many of the Senator's questions as I can.

The Department is firmly committed to that project and to its funding and will work closely with Waterford officials to make sure it comes to fruition.<\/p> <p>  On the broad issue of resourcing, the idea with Town Centre First is that there will be a staffed national office within the Local Government Management Agency.  We are in the final stages between the two Departments.  We have funding to staff that office and they will also have some secondments from each Department.  They will drive the town centre programme and the network of town regeneration officers.

A lot of it is around looking at the properties.  That is why the town regeneration officers and vacant home officers are really important in seeing what scope is there.  The derelict site provision gives local authorities a lot of powers but there is inconsistency in terms of the approach.

As the Chairman rightly said, it has been hugely informative and we have had a number of very engaging sessions.  In particular, I pay tribute to the officials from the Department.  It is very clear that they have a great grasp of this area.  A huge sense of enthusiasm for and information about the opportunities afforded by these funding streams are reflected in their presentation.  Today has taken on an additional dimension in that we have launched our Town Centre First policy, which will very much inform future policy, particularly relating to the URDF.  I am interested in changes to the scoring criteria for that scheme where it will be very much led by the local Town Centre First policy as opposed to the traditional competitive call.  How confident are the witnesses that this will bring to the top the quality of projects we want and need to see?  Are they reassured that this will happen?<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Town Centre First policy, vacancies will remain a significant challenge in provincial Ireland.  Regarding banks that continue to hold property in provincial towns, many of these are what banks refer to as low-hanging fruit.  They do not feel there is a sufficient need for them to dispose of those properties at this stage and they are waiting for the value of those properties to appreciate before they sell them.  Have the witnesses engaged with banks and got some sense of how much property is held by banks as opposed to members of the public?  How engaged are the main banks in terms of helping us to drive our Town Centre First policy?  <\/p> <p>  My final question is for Ms Clifford.  I know she has done a piece of work on projects that have funding.  Could she crystallise the issues in cases where they are struggling to get projects up and running?  I anticipate that one of them will be the change in building costs and an inability to get contractors.  Will the Department give consideration to these issues?  Will balloon payments need to be introduced for many of these projects that are at an advanced stage or ready to break ground but where there is real concern at local authority level that they do not have sufficient funding in place?  I am conscious that I have thrown plenty at the witnesses helter-skelter but I am sure they have picked out the salient points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#M00700","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Brien might be able to talk about it from the perspective of the rural fund but certainly from the urban fund perspective, we have been oversubscribed and have not had difficulty in finding good projects.  We are conscious that some projects were submitted that did not meet the criteria for the urban fund and we want to work with them to define them for the future.  The advantage of having the Town Centre First policy and the plan is that there is that engagement with the community around what the vision for the town is.  The next generation of projects should come from that.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I might touch on relates to banks.  The Housing Agency has had a housing acquisition fund where it has been dealing with banks in terms of properties as part of that and has done a lot of work in recent years.  We are now looking at that acquisition fund and where it goes in the future.  I know the Housing Agency is also engaging with a number of institutions that may have their own properties in areas that might be suitable.  Senator Boyhan mentioned former Garda stations.  There is a range of buildings that might be put to use and there might be an advantage in the Housing Agency centralising and working with local authorities in that area.  I will pass over to Ms Clifford to talk about problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>As I mentioned earlier, we have just come out of a series of meetings with local authorities looking at all of their URDF projects and getting a sense of where they are.  The overriding message is that there are issues around costs in particular such as construction price inflation and we are seeing this reflected in the budget costs for the projects.  The message I have given to local authorities is that we want them to do due diligence on costs because we do not want over-inflated costs that are not realistic but we also recognise that there are increases in costs and we will be able to meet some of those.  We have asked local authorities to look critically at that and other sources of funding that might be appropriate and help to absorb some of those additional costs.  To give an example, a project with quite a significant increase in costs was able to secure some funding from our colleagues in the NTA to fund the active travel parts of it because there is funding there for active travel.  This reduced the impact on the URDF element so we were able to absorb the rest of the cost.<\/p><p>We have an iterative process with the local authorities on budget development as projects move through the various stages of the public spending code.  We are not telling local authorities that only a certain amount of funding is available and that is it.  There is obviously a process to be gone through as these projects develop to the construction stage, and we are working with local authorities on that, looking at how much the fund can absorb and what other sources of funding might be available for other elements of the project that might be more suitable to, say, active travel or whatever else.  Our colleagues in the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Department of Transport have been co-operative in terms of those types of projects.  I hope that answers the question.  It is an ongoing process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Clifford","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I will respond to the mention of engagement over banks and buildings such as Garda stations.  That is relevant to the town and village renewal scheme.  The Department of Rural and Community Development has had some engagement with banks about their buildings rather than anything else.

Some of those bank buildings and Garda stations tend to be strategically important buildings within towns, so we are working on that as a conduit of communication.<\/p> <p>  The committee may have heard that some relevant projects were included in the recent town and village renewal announcement.

I started my earlier contribution by talking about local and regional ambition and national impact.  I acknowledge the amazing input of our guests.  They are, dare I say it, members of the permanent Civil Service.  They know what is going on and we are fortunate to have people like them at the helm.<\/p><p>There is, however, a disconnect between our guests and the local authorities.  There is always a tension with local authority members.  Ms Graham spoke in her presentation about engagement in workshops.  I am not sure enough of that is going on with the local authority members.  We must remember there will always be a healthy tension between the executive of a local authority and its elected members.  That healthy tension is a good thing and long may it last.  Those members are watchdogs and are holding the executive to account.  That is a part of their remit and function.  However, they are somehow left out of the picture in terms of information.  I wrote to every chief executive today to tell them this meeting was on.  I know it was short notice but I asked them to confirm their knowledge and understanding of the situation and whether they had a vacant housing officer or town centre officer.  It was pushing it a bit to ask if they had town centre officers because that role has only recently been announced.  I had an interesting mix of reactions from some of those chief executives.  Some of them said they need more clarification and I ask our guests to take that home with them.  We have had a lot of external communication but perhaps we are not as good at internal communication within the local government sector and other State agencies.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the importance and excitement of all of this.  It shows a realisation that people can be ambitious for their rural towns and expect to see something happening, with a national input from the Government.<\/p><p>I will return to the article in yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, which contained a reference to smart data and how we collect it.  We can collect an awful lot of data in respect of utilities.  That happens in Scotland and other parts of the UK.  I am familiar with how it happens there.  We can keep it simple.  There are many agencies that feed utilities into properties, be they commercial or residential, and we need to do more work on that.  I think the Chair will agree that the committee would be interested in hearing more about that area.  We do not necessarily have the expertise but I would like to hear more about that area.<\/p><p>I would like to know that we have fully resourced our local authorities with vacant housing officers and town centre officers.  Perhaps within the next few weeks the Departments could come back to the committee confirming those officers are in place.  Sometimes we have to chase these things.  It is surprising how difficult it is sometimes.  I would like to see a list.  I made a commitment to the chief executives that I would be back on their tails and looking for this information.  I should not have to do that.  We, as a committee, should get some reassurance that this is actually happening.  I would like our guests to put that on their list of actions.<\/p><p>One of the first things I said earlier related to local authority declarations of vacant properties.  Would it be possible for the committee to have a copy of the latest local authority declaration of vacant properties for all 31 local authorities?  That would be helpful.  We bring to this debate our own knowledge of local government.  Most members of this committee have been elected to city or county councils.  That would be interesting.  The more information we share with one another, the more we can understand.  We can then monitor progress.  Our guests might address those few issues.<\/p><p>I will wrap up by saying this is very positive news.  There will be issues and challenges from time to time, but the will and ambition are there and people are excited.  The only possible setback may, in time, be resources, but we got a clear commitment today that resources will not be an issue.

The point the Senator made about elected members is an interesting one and we will take that away because there is an important point at the moment around communication.  Part of the enabling framework will have a network of town regeneration officers and a national oversight group, which will be very important in bringing all these elements together.  It is important to acknowledge that a considerable variety of people were involved in the advisory group that developed the town centre first scheme, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made an important point about smart data because data are a part of that town regeneration element.<\/p> <p>  On the vacant home officers, we asked local authorities, in the circular we issued, to come back to us indicating what resources they would put in.

What happens in the public element of that is important because it does, as the Chairman mentioned earlier, create spin-offs and investment.  We have seen that in a couple of locations.<\/p><p>In Clones, County Monaghan, in the public arm of that which is social housing, rather than having the sites which were perhaps more peripheral, we made a conscious effort to try to invest in a building or street which was perhaps one of these derelict and vacant properties we mentioned earlier.  These have been brought back into two or three homes and there has been an uplift in that street, in the activity and in the visual presentation of it in terms of the buildings, as opposed to the footpaths, roads, the public lighting and so forth.  It has also created a spin-off with private properties that were in a similar state, where investment has been made in the upkeep of those properties because the owners have seen the commitment on the public side of things.  This will generate a response in the market, if one can call it that.<\/p><p> That is the strong tenet and, as I mentioned earlier, we are engaging with the local authorities on a very active basis, in particular with the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, URDF, and it is a point to be made time and again.  One of the learnings from the past two years, in particular, is the reclaiming of the street by the public, namely, the reclaiming of the car parking spaces outside pubs and restaurants having outdoor dining facilities.  Both our Department and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have found that has been very successful.  To be honest, it has overcome some of the reticence, sometimes, of the local traders and of the local community around that as they can see it can be very positive in the economic sense and in the life and activity within the town itself.  That is something we are building on in terms of trying to encourage businesses to do more of that because it chimes very much with the Towns Centre First policy and the night-time economy policy we are preparing.  That activity is something that just cannot be left there; there has to be intervention also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stewart Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I realise we are crossing somewhat into the active travel area and the remit of the Department of Transport but there is definitely close co-operation between the local authorities on active transport and the URDF in linking those places up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#O00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I would also make the point that that is essentially one of the main lessons that came through from the advisory group, namely, that the Town Centre First policy has to co-ordinate these different funds that are available.

We hear a great deal about the big-ticket items such as the &euro;81 million project mentioned by Mr. Logan in Waterford on the North Quays.  If I am a private building owner, and the Department has done a very nice square, a public space, under the new URDF, and I want to develop my second or third floor into apartments and residential living space, or even the lower floor if it complies with the local area plan, I do not have any control over the footpath outside.  Nobody wants to walk out the front door of their apartment with a child to a 2 ft. wide footpath.  One would want some space there for planters and so forth.  Such a person has no control over that but the local authority does.  How does the interaction work on smaller jobs like that to improve the offering for pedestrians in terms of the safety aspect and making it more attractive to bring it back into residential use?  These are for quite small projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#O00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>They are but again they are feeding into a local situation.  It is very much a question of the prioritisation of those projects where one has perhaps, as the Chairman said, some activity in the private market around housing which should co-ordinate with what is available from the Department of Transport in respect of those.  A normal stock in trade for local authorities' functions is improving footpaths, public lighting and road maintenance.  Our piece is probably the larger one, which is the public realm piece, where there is a new plaza or a significant investment which may involve repurposing or reinvesting in the water infrastructure that is under that road.  That can also be a co-ordination piece.  There is good practice.<\/p> <p>  The point was made earlier around the data that is involved in this dereliction, which has to be considered.  However, there is also a piece about best practice.  That is certainly something we want the Town Centre First national co-ordination office to do and to be aware of.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Graham mentioned, there is good practice around the making of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, in terms of the use of the Derelict Sites Act in Waterford and Limerick.  That is such an exchange because there is not a form for it at the moment and we are contacted constantly by individuals within the local authorities who ask how this is being done elsewhere.  I know it is being done elsewhere but what is the form?  We want that to be built on and to provide that communication and best practice exchange between local authorities so they are able to build on good practice elsewhere and, certainly, to see more of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stewart Logan"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I am conscious there is often criticism of local authorities but, from my experience, they are doing fantastic work out there, particularly in areas of planning and active transport.

That is one of the additional officers I would like to see added to every local authority along with a vacant homes officer.  A county architect would be one of the most beneficial posts we could create which could pull all those different divisions together, that is, active transport and the ability to try to find building owners.  The big disincentive is that we just do not know who owns the buildings or the derelict sites.  It is too big a task to chase that down, so it just gets left and ignored.

I can think of someone in my own area with great ideas.  Sometimes we are top-heavy in local government.  Our chief executives are dominant characters by their very nature in how they have come up to that position, as most of them have come up through the ranks.  Not very many of them have come from the private sector, from somewhere else or, indeed, from overseas.  This is the way, unfortunately, that we do local government, so it is the same people.  They start in a local authority in a rural area and move into the city.<\/p> <p>  One can have very many skilled people in local government, including architects, landscape architects, parks designers and public realm people and when one gets enthusiasm, it carries the day and brings support with it.  One does not necessarily need all of the skills.  Enthusiasm carries one along in the public realm.<\/p> <p>  It is interesting because I am a landscape contractor by profession and I know everybody wants to have a property on the south side.  I can take people to streets in my own town of D&uacute;n Laoghaire where there is not a vacant shop facing south.  Aspect and orientation is a factor in respect of the sun.  There are so many little facets to a place.  A street can become activated and animated.  We have seen this through the Covid-19 period, where so many places which had nothing now had people outside selling bits of food, coffee and so forth and there was improved paving or temporary facilities.  These places have taken on a life of their own and a number of people have said to me that there are places within five or ten minutes of their house that they never knew existed.<\/p><p>There would be outdoor space, which improves community and local interaction.  There are so many knock-on effects.<\/p><p> Again, I wish everybody well.  I know many of the people here today are deeply involved with all of this.  It is a tribute and the witnesses should keep going.  Politicians come and go but what we have in common is that we call live in communities and villages.  What is really good about what we have spoken about today is the question of a local vision and ambition.  A regional vision can feed into our national plans.  For the first time in a long time - I was a councillor for over 20 years and I am here for a few years - I see a layering process and where we are going.

It is about highlighting that process and amplifying it within the projects.  In very big projects there are areas of dereliction and reuse.

Adding all the various policy tools that have been outlined, including the URDF and Town Centre First and so on, I take my perspective from the towns and villages in my community.  Many are what might be called urban villages.  I am thinking of areas like Finglas and towns like Ballymun.  They could be replicated in places like Raheny and new communities in Donaghmede and so on.  The question is where those urban villages fit in the policy framework.<\/p> <p>  For example, with Town Centre First, do urban villages fall under its remit?  Are they eligible to apply?  Dublin City Council has not made applications under that scheme.  The URDF, a large amount of very welcome money, has primarily gone to the inner city area and it is often used for large citywide projects.  We must look to the future expansion of housing, such as that on the Oscar Traynor Road lands, with nearly 1,000 homes, and the Ballymun local area plan, which has nearly 2,000 homes.  The master plan for private land on the Jamestown Road site would accommodate more than 1,000 homes as well.  How do we retrofit existing communities with facilities that are needed for those new homes?  Adding more homes into those communities that in many cases have already experienced a dearth of community facilities would only compound problems.<\/p> <p>  In particular I am thinking of the community at Santry, which has seen much private sector development, all on private land.  It has two large council areas on either side and perhaps it has missed out on some service provision that may exist in areas where the city council may have more of a presence.  Will the witnesses piece together a plan that I can beat up Dublin City Council with?  I can say that tools are available to these towns and what the council should apply to.<\/p> <p>  I echo the point made by Senator Boyhan on the accountability for who is deciding what applications for URDF come before the Department.  Those decisions are largely made by officials.  My understanding is there has not been any serious democratic scrutiny of which applications come before the Department for the scheme, which is an issue.  The Ballymun local area plan is a Dublin City Council project and it has been on its books since 2017.  All the land is owned by Dublin City Council.  Despite this, the council did not put forward the area for the URDF.  There is something wrong in that respect when there is such an obvious need to tackle disadvantage and at the same time address the question of new and affordable housing and cost rental.  I appreciate there is much to get through there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#P01300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I will try to do so.  I wrote down something in reply to Senator Boyhan and it would be remiss of me not to say that in all this we have seen huge co-operation from local authorities and chief executives in their engagement.  That is important.  The point made by the Deputy on the involvement of elected members is one we can take away and look at.<\/p><p>Urban villages are a really interesting concept.  There was a book that wrote about Dublin being created of villages.  The Town Centre First policy is primarily focused on towns that have their own integrity but it specifically provides that the principles can be applied in cities and to very small villages.  Those are the concepts about community knowing what they want the future of their area to look like, the place-making piece.  While much of Town Centre First will be focused on enabling the towns, including towns in north Dublin, the URDF covers areas with a population of over 10,000.  Therefore, we will include the urban villages.<\/p><p> Earlier Lisa Clifford explained that because we were oversubscribed, we had to look at the core areas, but we will move out.  I take on board the point the Deputy made about how prioritisation within an authority might be looked at in that context.  We were anxious to get the first lot of projects up and running because that gives us a perspective on how much funding is left and as we go into the latter phases more funding will be available.  Those are important points the Deputy has made.<\/p><p> The cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe towns will be focused on towns and the cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe cities will be focused on cities.  The CPO powers go across the board.  There are a range of sources.  Some urban development funding will come in from the regional assemblies.

I know Ms Graham does not mean it in that sense of the word.  There are distinct geographic areas that make up a city.  If we are going to be more sustainable and have 15-minute cities, urban villages must increasingly become places where people connect so that people are not travelling into and out of the city all the time and rather are travelling into their local village.

No additional sites were added to that and the local authority did not collect a single cent under the derelict sites levy in 2020.  Six sites on the vacant sites register that are vacant now were vacant on the register in 2020.  They were worth over &euro;55 million but not a cent was collected on that.  Fingal County Council is losing out on money here.  Has the Department provided assistance for the collection of this money?  What level of engagement has there been?<\/p> <p>  My next question is very parochial and one on which I have asked a number of parliamentary questions.  I am looking for guidance and assistance from the witnesses.  The HSE owns derelict houses on HSE land in Portrane in my constituency.  I understand that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has no hostility to working to get these brought back into use.  Who needs to make the final decision on this?  I have corresponded with the Minister.  He is aware of this; it is in his own area.  It needs a push to get it started.  In the meantime, several houses could be brought back into use.  In their day they were really decent family homes and we would like to see them brought back into use.  It is not fully the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and not fully the responsibility of the Department of Health.  The Department of Health owns the land and the houses, but it does not have the capacity to do anything with them.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has the capacity but it does not own the land and houses.  It just needs somebody to take the initiative on this.  I have asked both Departments and both of them have said they have no problem with somebody taking an initiative but nobody is taking an initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#Q01000","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question on derelict sites first.

We are very open to proposing legislative changes or seeing if some local authorities are better in their practice and seeing if that practice can be rolled out.  We see that very much as part of what the Town Centre First policy might do.<\/p><p> In terms of properties that are derelict, our Secretary General has written to all Secretaries General to see what portfolio projects they may have that could be used.  There is an action under Housing for All for State properties that are underutilised.  Many of the structures that are in Housing for All are looking at driving these actions in combination and how this might be brought forward.  First, we must get the data on what is out there but also on what mechanisms we can use.  We are looking with the Housing Agency to see if it has a role, because sometimes it can activate issues more easily as a single body than multiple local authorities, for example, dealing with HSE properties.  We have a number of funding schemes.  Many of them are focused on individuals.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns funding is for individuals, but we are looking with the regional assemblies at European funding that is due to be finalised at the end of the second quarter to see if there are gaps where resourcing could be put in place.

I apologise if it was because, like Deputy O'Reilly, I was in the Chamber.  I refer to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  Local authorities have spent millions on what could be described as the unsuccessful pursuit of properties.  In many cases, it is not as much the availability of resources as the chilling effect a bad case can have.  Local authorities ask why they would spend hundreds of thousands of euro pursuing a single property when it might get nowhere in the courts and it could spend the money on developing housing.  One of the big issues we have is a reluctance by officials to go down the road of CPOs at all.  Whatever powers we give and whatever changes we make in the area, we must also give confidence to local authority officials that they can pursue matters.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that it is far too cumbersome to secure properties.  I do not represent the area any longer, but there are two properties on Walsh Road and everybody in the whole of Drumcondra knows the two houses are collapsing in on top of each other.  There are huge problems.  Ten years after I raised the issue on the council, those properties are still there for all the complicated reasons that exist.  There are many similar properties around Dublin city.  Often, it can come down to the financial capacity of the owners of the properties or other limiting capacities.  People may have other issues.  On a different site in my area, somebody inherited a very large property but does not have the mental health resilience to be able to take on a project of that size.  Active land management must be the key here.  We need to empower local authorities not just to tackle vacancy but to undertake active land management whereby solutions are put together for landowners that otherwise would not have the financial or business acumen or inclination to proceed with a project.<\/p> <p>  Providing them is one thing, but sometimes local authorities have to put together a solution to unlock the potential of a site.  Vacancy officers are one element in the equation, but in Ballymun, for example, we have an economic officer specifically for that electoral district within the city.  It is unique to Dublin City Council.  He actively tries to unlock the potential of units that are developed, for example, that have large fit-out costs or leases that are taking too long to get through the local authority or for whatever other reason.  That is what we need to see both in terms of vacancy and CPOs.

Some aspects of it will come up in the context of the planning review.  It has been highlighted as an area of difficulty.  In the meantime, one of the measures the Housing Agency has put in place is a dedicated procurement unit with CPO advice so that it can advise local authorities.  It produces guidance around that and will continue to do it.  Bridging finance will come from the Housing Finance Agency, in particular if local authorities want to compulsorily purchase properties, as we envisage under Housing for All, and put them out to the market.  As Deputy McAuliffe says, quite often it is the case the individual who owns a property does not have the wherewithal for a number of reasons to bring it back into use.  We do need to look at what risks a local authority might face in that regard and ensure we mitigate the risks so that local authorities can move with a degree of confidence even in a complex process.

I would love to see more people getting access even to the grounds if not to the observatory itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#S00100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I have heard the Deputy raise that issue in the D&aacute;il Chamber as well.

Blackpool is probably one of the most historic areas in Cork, with the history of the area going back hundreds of years.  We have villages within cities which have their own identification and the people associate with them.  Should they not qualify under the town and village scheme?  Blackpool is an area I have been looking to have regenerated for decades.  It has huge issues around flooding and dereliction and, to me, this area would be perfect for that scheme.  Is it possible to include villages within cities or towns?  I know a population of less than 10,000 is required under the town and village renewal scheme but Blackpool is losing out because it is part of Cork city and it is not seen as a village in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#S00500","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":662,"content":"<p>As the town and village scheme is currently constituted, Blackpool would not be seen as eligible as it is part of the city.

The funding for the vacant homes officers was pre-funded up to June of this year so they are coming back to us over the coming months.  We expect them all to be full-time and that is what we have asked for, and we do not have any indications otherwise.

We are working with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to look at what gaps there may be at the moment, what future gaps there may be and what skills gaps there may be.  That ultimately may lead to engagement with the third level sector to deal with the kind of skills that are required for the future.

When we were looking back at both of the calls and reviewing once the announcements were made, it was very clear there were a number of areas where, from a national planning framework, NPF, perspective, we need investment but the right projects had not come through.  That has influenced our thinking in terms of working more directly with the local authorities going forward, particularly those local authorities where we can see there are gaps in their development objectives where we need to target investment.  That is what is guiding how we are going to develop the next call, moving slightly away from the more competitive element of it and really targeting the investment in those gap areas where, from an NPF perspective, the ERDF has not found the right project yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#S01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Clifford"},{"type":"speech","time":1646697600,"counter":672,"content":"<p>I will give Mr. O'Brien the last word on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022030800002#T00100","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646697600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>On that point, there are a number of different approaches across our schemes.  Quality is obviously a major issue when it comes to the best use of public funds, but we are also aware of the imperative around balanced regional development.  We have a number of conditions within schemes to help that along.  For example, in respect of the town and village renewal scheme, we look at minimum levels of funding for counties to make sure there is no risk of being completely left behind.  We make sure there is a maximum number of applications per local authority in order that a scheme is not dominated by particular areas.  Overall, we track that and keep an eye on the regional spread.  We have published some maps, including heat maps, relating to the spread of those proposals and projects that are funded.  Quality is a significant issue for us but we keep regional spread in mind.  As Ms Graham said, there is an element of us supporting those areas that may not have been as successful in the past and keeping an eye on that.
