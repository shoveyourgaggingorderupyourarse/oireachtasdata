Our sympathies go out to Mr. Hourihane's family and friends.  The nature of his death illustrates the fragility and vulnerability of many homeless people.  There is a growing fear factor, whether it is in terms of safety in hostels, in tents or on the streets.  This is the sixth death on the streets in Cork so far this year.  Nationally, approximately 50 homeless people die every year.  An increased supply of secure accommodation is the key step to tackling the scale of this crisis.  The more secure a person's accommodation is, the lower is the risk of dying.<\/p><p>The problem is escalating year after year.  In 2014, Cork City Council spent more than &euro;100,000 on bed and breakfasts and hotels for homeless people, including many families.  In 2018, it spent &euro;3 million on such services, and that figure is growing.  Homelessness in Cork city increased by 30% in the year to August, and has also increased in the south west generally.  I agree with today's <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>editorial, which states: &quot;All efforts to confront this toxic crisis have been, on political, ideological, cultural and practical levels, failures.&quot;  There is no other way of describing it.<\/p><p>I spoke to the Simon Community yesterday.  Its emergency centre is overflowing every night.  It told me that there were 18 tents in the location where Timmy Hourihane was savagely beaten to death.  Ms Caitriona Twomey of Cork Penny Dinners, a well-known and popular facility where many homeless people and families in distress are fed, described Timmy as the warmest, kindest man.  She also said that this is a warning to the Government that it must solve the homelessness crisis now.  She said people are dying and we need more homes, housing, treatment centres and support services.  The Government's response to date has not been of sufficient scale, creativity or urgency to deal with this.  Does the Taoiseach accept that Government policies for reducing homelessness to date have clearly failed?<\/p><p>Does he accept there has been a lack of urgency, creativity and scale to address the chronic housing and homelessness crisis and that 50 deaths a year among our homeless community on our streets is a damning indictment of the Government's failures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571144700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  I want to say how filled with sadness I was when I read about the killing of Timothy Hourihane in Cork.  On behalf of the entire House, I extend my sympathies to his friends, to his family and to all of those who worked with him down the years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is treating this death as a homicide and, therefore, a criminal investigation is under way.  I encourage anyone who has any information whatsoever about this suspected homicide to give that information to the Garda.  We do not know the circumstances of his death and who killed him.  I do not think it is right for us to speculate on that, suffice to say that anybody who has any information as to who was responsible for the killing of this poor man should share that information with the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, I am always reluctant to talk about individual cases.  However, much information about this case is already in the public domain.  When one reads about it, it is a truly sad story.  It is a real human tragedy.  Mr. Hourihane was treated for addiction for over a year.  After that, he was discharged to the care of his family.  He was offered an apartment in Nicholas Street in Cork but never took up the apartment.  For that reason, it was passed on to somebody else.  He was supported by homeless charities on a number of occasions over the course of the past two years.  He is somebody whose family really tried to help him, who was helped by the housing charities and who was helped by addiction services.  He was also provided with an apartment, all funded by Government.  Unfortunately, this demonstrates how complex the problem of homelessness often is, how hard it can be to help people but how we should never give up trying to help people, no matter what the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider issue of homelessness, the Government has acknowledged on many occasions that this is a problem which we are really struggling to solve.  Homelessness is a stain on our society.  Over 100,000 people now live in emergency accommodation, although the numbers rough-sleeping is much lower than that, probably around 150.  No level of it is acceptable, however.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of what we are doing, we are increasing funding for homelessness supports and for homelessness agencies.  The budget provided a &euro;20 million increase in funding for homelessness agencies and supports, increasing the budget for homelessness to &euro;166 million.  I know full well, however, that this is only treating the symptoms and not the underlying problem.  To treat the underlying problem, we need to build much more social housing.  We have now embarked on the biggest social housing programme in many decades.  This year over 10,000 units will be added to the social housing stock, more than any year this century.  About 11,000 units will be added next year.  It is making a difference, particularly when it is connected to Housing First where we try to ensure people who are rough-sleeping or have difficulty holding down a tenancy are given the supports they need to hold on to that apartment or house if they are given one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571144700,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I do not think the first part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply was appropriate.

That was my point.  Is it to keep throwing money at the same solutions?  It tells me the Taoiseach is not getting the scale of the problem - you have never got the scale of this problem - and do I think the Government ever has.  The Government is not building enough secure accommodation.  This August, in Cork city alone, the number of homeless on the streets went up 32% on August of last year.  The funding is stopping the escalation but is not dealing with the root causes of it.  There is a chronic inability to build social housing of scale.  There is no question about that.

The ruling was made in the case of Emma DeSouza.  Emma has fought a long and admirable campaign with the British Home Office to be legally recognised as an Irish citizen only.  Emma's case is well known and has become a symbol of the need to protect Irish identify and citizenship in the North.  Despite the fact her right to identify solely as an Irish citizen had been upheld at a number of tribunal hearings, the British Home Office dragged Emma through the courts to overturn that decision.  She believes, with good reason, that this represents a hardline effort on the part of the British Government to restrict access to EU entitlements for citizens in the North of Ireland following Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday's ruling represents a clear effort by the British Government to undermine the Good Friday Agreement.  In fact, the ruling tramples all over the agreement.  That agreement is crystal clear that those born in the North of Ireland are entitled to identify as British, Irish, or both.  However, the British Home Office refuses to recognise Emma DeSouza as an Irish-only citizen resident in the North of Ireland and, in so doing, it refuses to recognise the core legal component of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The decision has also exposed the failure of successive British Governments to enshrine the relevant provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in domestic law.  The identity and citizenship provisions are critical to the integrity of the agreement as a whole and they must be protected and defended to the hilt.  The British Home Office must acknowledge the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and allow Emma to assert her full rights as an Irish and EU citizen.  They must also understand that it is unacceptable to pursue a young woman through the courts for simply being Irish, especially when her position had already been legally vindicated.<\/p>  <p>  More than 20 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government continues to fail in its responsibilities as a co-guarantor.  Those failures must be challenged.  The Taoiseach told us that Irish citizens in the North would never again be left behind by an Irish Government and he now needs to follow through on those words and that promise.  The Government, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, has a key role to play.  The Taoiseach needs to step up and defend Emma, her rights and the rights of all Irish citizens in the North.  Can he indicate what the Government proposes to do to defend the Good Friday Agreement in light of this ruling?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500005#C00700","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1571145600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald for raising this important issue, which is of huge significance to people living in Northern Ireland in particular.

That is the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.

I refer to the decision of the Sisters of Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary to withdraw from involvement at Bessborough by the end of the year, to attempt to sell the land there and to effectively evict the onsite services which cater to the needs of vulnerable families, especially women and children at the Bessborough campus.  These services include fostering services, psychological services, secondary school services, family outreach services, services for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and supervised access services.  The centre caters for the needs of 50 families every week.  Residential accommodation is provided for six vulnerable adults and seven children at Bessborough.  Where are these people to go now?  Services are provided at Bessborough which will not be found anywhere else in this State.  The parent and infant unit is just one example of this.  More than 100 people work at this centre.  A question mark now hangs over these jobs.<\/p>  <p>  A statement issued by the staff last week said: \"The nuns are about to run off with a significant amount of money, leaving none in Ireland to compensate staff or the State for the huge investment that they have made in the family services.\"  This begs the question: is the State going to allow an order of nuns with headquarters outside this State to break up a family centre in which the State has invested &euro;30 million?  These are the same Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary who ran the infamous Bessborough mother and baby home, who profited from the illegal sale of children, snatched from their mothers, to the US, Canada and Australia and who to this day have failed to account for the whereabouts of well over 800 children who died.  Every June for the past five years people from all over the world have travelled to Bessborough to remember the women and children.  Will that ceremony be possible if the lands are in private ownership?<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Taoiseach that the State should acquire these lands and the buildings constructed upon them preferably by way of nationalisation without compensation to guarantee the future of the family services and the jobs and to allow real discussion with survivors' groups about what work might need to be done to identify the whereabouts of the more than 800 children who died who are missing.

Our failed insurance market poses a lethal threat to small businesses and consumers.  Futures are in jeopardy and jobs are lost.  The common denominator is excessive and suffocating premiums.  Unjustifiable premiums are causing financial hardship, leading to enormous levels of stress and anxiety.  Overzealous and at times impractical health and safety regulations, with associated insurance demands, are quenching community spirit throughout the country.  Volunteers are frustrated and disillusioned to witness their free time, their skills and their commitment blown away with insurmountable insurance premiums.<\/p><p>It is no secret that our insurance industry, as structured at present, is crippling many sectors of our society.  Similar to the housing crisis, we have an absence of insurance supply, an excess of demand, too little competition and a collapse of affordability.  The consumer is a prisoner in a system that is dysfunctional.  The consumer is subjected to a legal form of exploitation and extortion.  The insurance sector has become expert at manipulating and taking advantage of consumers trapped in a captive market.  The consumer is at the mercy of greedy, profiteering multinational insurance consortiums.  The public, in a word, is being ransacked by the current insurance regime.  In retaliation for excessive costs, everyone, including politicians, have for years been pointing the finger at the insurance companies, solicitors, the legal profession and the Judiciary.  Solicitors and barristers are prone to lodging inflated claims in the expectation that, after legal argument, they will succeed in obtaining exaggerated awards.<\/p><p>For the most part, people who make claims have a legitimate case and, when proven, they are entitled to reasonable and adequate compensation.  However, in Ireland, we have cultivated a litigation culture that too often appears to reward the chancers and fraudsters.  The glaring weakness in claims procedure is placing a huge financial burden on the insurance companies and, ultimately, consumers.  The industry has numerous agencies and oversight bodies, which are lamentably ineffective.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has made commendable efforts, with initiatives intended to reduce costs and bring fairness and transparency to the sector, but the harsh fact is that he has been obstructed and stifled by vested interests.  Given the broad range of practices, the professionals who work the system have a huge financial interest in protecting the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The current system creates a level of coexistence and self-interest that is difficult to penetrate and break down.  Sweeping reforms are urgently required.  The current situation is unsustainable and there is a need for urgent action to assist the beleaguered consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500008#F01100","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this important issue.  I know that the cost of insurance is a huge issue for citizens, businesses and voluntary organisations.  We have made some progress in recent years in stabilising the cost of health insurance through lifetime community rating, keeping the cost of home insurance down and reducing the cost of car insurance, which is now down approximately 25% on its 2016 peak.  However, we have a huge issue when it comes to reducing the cost of public liability insurance for business and voluntary organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent step the Government has taken to improve the situation is the Judicial Council Act, which is now law.  That Act allows for the establishment of the judicial council, which in turn will establish a personal injuries guidelines committee.  That committee will draw up new guidelines as to the appropriate awards to be given to people who suffer injury as a consequence of negligence or a failure of duty of care on the part of others.  These new guidelines will replace the book of quantum.  While we cannot interfere directly in any way with the deliberations of the judicial council and its committees, the objective is to bring the kinds of awards people get for injuries in Ireland more in line with those in other countries.  We then expect the insurance industry to respond by reducing premiums.<\/p>  <p>  There is an engagement at present between the Chief Justice and the Attorney General on ensuring that the judicial council is set up before the end of the year.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been provided in the 2020 budget for this.  This should be more than enough to run a relatively small new public body.  I know that the Chief Justice is doing what he can to identify steps which need to be taken to ensure that the council is in a position to hit the ground running once established.  I hope that once the new guidelines are in place, and even before then, judges will recognise the importance of having reasonable guidelines and awards that are in line with international norms because high payouts have a real-world impact.  This is not just about the plaintiff in question; it is also about the wider impact on society.  Very high payments coupled with very high premiums in Ireland are having a real impact.  They are causing businesses to close, jobs to be lost and sporting, leisure and musical activities that take place in other countries to be unviable in Ireland.  That is wrong, and we need to consider the wider social and economic impact of high awards on people in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500009#G00100","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>It is also important to realise that the public is angry at the scale of the profits being made.  The scale of profits suggests that the insurance industry has lost its sense of service.  Previously, one's insurance broker or insurance agent was a trusted guide; now they increasingly resemble a group of profiteers.  What we are looking for is real and substantial insurance reform.  The public is looking for timelines and wants to know when there will be effective action.  It is important to remember that the worldwide trend is towards significant reductions in premiums.  Ireland stands out because the opposite is the case, with alarming increases annually.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Government's proposed judicial council, I suggest that the Taoiseach send, with respect to the separation of powers, a polite but stern message to the Judiciary because it is moving on this issue at a pace that could at its kindest be described as stately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500009#G00200","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1571146800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>We all share the objective here, which is to reduce the cost of insurance for citizens, businesses and voluntary organisations.

I ask the Judiciary to proceed without delay in establishing the judicial council, setting up a personal injuries commission and replacing the book of quantum with a schedule of awards that are more realistic and more in line with those of other countries.  We also need the insurance industry to play its part in bringing down premiums and reducing its profit margins.  We also have the Garda involved in stepping up its activities relating to the investigation of fraud.  The Government has asked the Law Reform Commission to undertake a detailed analysis as to whether we could establish constitutionally sound legislation to cap or limit the amount of damages a court may award.  We expect public consultation on that matter later this year.  It will be interesting to see what the Law Reform Commission comes up with because if the other reforms do not work, we need to consider the possibility of legislating in this House to limit and cap awards.  We should not rule out a referendum down the line if the existing reforms that are planned do not work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500009#G00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1571147400,"counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500010#H00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1571147400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The business this week shall be as set out in the first revised report of the Business Committee, dated 14 October 2019.<\/p><p>On today's business, it is proposed that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 10 p.m. and shall adjourn on the conclusion of Private Members&rsquo; time, which shall be taken for two hours on the conclusion of the Parent's Leave and Benefits Bill 2019 [<i>Seanad<\/i>], or at 9.05 p.m., whichever is the later.

Specifically, he spoke of Catholic politicians having a responsibility to support laws which uphold the dignity of every human person made in God's image from conception to death, and cautioned against politicians having parallel lives which are compartmentalised into spiritual and secular spheres.<\/p>  <p>  As we become more pluralist and our society becomes infinitely more multicultural, the idea of Catholic politicians could become deeply problematic, especially for growing minority groups.  When Catholic bishop Daniel Mageean wrote in 1939 that Lord Craigavon had adopted the slogan \"A Protestant parliament for a Protestant people\", he did so in protest of the subjugation of the rights of the Catholic minority.  Is it not time we left those types of characterisations in the past?  In a republic, we cherish the right of everybody to adhere to and express the religion of their choice, but we should not revert to a time when clerics instructed politicians, as used to be the case in both this jurisdiction and the North.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach intend to discuss the aforementioned comment about Catholic politicians in the context of the church-State covenant he is discussing with church leaders?

However, most of the reactions to the forum have noted how little substance there is to what was presented as a major initiative.  The issues the Taoiseach addressed in his opening speech have been on the agenda for a long time and the principles outlined have, in most cases, been official policy for a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  In education, for example, the key pillars of diversity, pluralism, and alternative school models were first supported by me and Mary O'Rourke in the Department of Education.  Mary Hanafin developed a new model of community national schools, and large-scale divestment of Catholic patronage was proposed ten years ago.  Archbishop Martin himself proposed a divestment of 50% of the schools in his diocese.  That divestment has not yet materialised but the pace has been very slow.  The target of 50% divestment within 12 months was unilaterally announced by then Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in 2011, and emphasis was placed on political statements rather than any deep engagement.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach tell us whether the new covenant is a substantive initiative or a general process?

It would be a good thing, notwithstanding other political issues around the Northern Assembly, such as Brexit and so on.  This would be a huge victory for women in the North.<\/p>  <p>  In the Taoiseach's discussions with religious leaders of any variety, what attitude have they indicated towards the possible extension of abortion rights to the people of the North in a few weeks?  We all remember the great scenes in Dublin Castle when a student lifted a placard reading \"The North is next\" out of the crowd, and the following huge affirmation that this should happen.

Thousands of us campaigned for many years for the right to abortion services in Ireland.  However, it now transpires that just over half of the country's 19 maternity units are providing full abortion services, namely, the three Dublin maternity hospitals and one each in Mullingar, Drogheda, Galway, Mayo, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  If a woman or pregnant person lives in any other county, they must travel, usually twice.  While 340 GPs have signed up to provide abortion services, many counties remain unrepresented on that list.  The reason for this gap is the conscientious objection clause in the legislation.  These are State-funded hospitals that are paid for by the taxpayer, yet the rights of a tiny minority are preventing the will of the majority from being implemented.  That is wrong.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach will say we are gratuitously bashing the church, as he told my colleague who raised a church-State matter during Leaders' Questions.  That seems to be his go-to phrase whenever anyone challenges the church.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to sex education.  The religious right is now targeting this issue and whipping parents into a frenzy about it.  The Minister stated last week that ethos will not prevent this curriculum being taught, but I am not so sure about that.  Will the Government change the law in order that the characteristic spirit of the school cannot be used to prevent the teaching of objective sex education? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500017#P00400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1571151000,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The changes to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred will actually occur next Monday.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the matter of former mother and baby homes.  As the Taoiseach knows, four years have passed since the commission of investigation into this issue was established.  In that period, five interim reports have been published and the inquiry has been granted a one-year extension.  That extension was necessary in part due to the lateness of materials submitted through discovery by the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs.  I am sure the Taoiseach is as shocked as I am to discover the extent of documentation that had not been submitted or may even have been suppressed.  Last year, the commission acknowledged the efforts made by HSE staff to find relevant documentation, but was dismayed at how little had been found.  Even relatively recent information was not available.<\/p>  <p>  This should cause us concern.  There are very few burial records for the Tuam or Bessborough homes, despite their significantly high child mortality rates.  I am sure church leaders, just like Members of this House, are anxious that Departments and State agencies do not stymie the commission's efforts to gather all necessary documentation to complete its work.  I hope the Taoiseach can give them and us that reassurance and encouragement, in order that this work is finished completely and expeditiously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500017#P00500","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1571151000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  Deputy Howlin referred to the Kennedy Summer School, which I had the privilege of attending and speaking at.  I also paid tribute to its founder, Mr. Noel Whelan.  The school is going from strength to strength and will show its worth in the years ahead, even more so than it has already.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin mentioned the views expressed by Archbishop Martin on the obligations of Catholic politicians.  As he was speaking, I was reminded of the words of St. John Henry Newman, who was canonised in Rome this weekend.  When he learned about the new doctrine of papal infallibility, he said he would drink to the Pope, but would first drink to his own conscience.<\/p><p>What St. John Henry Newman was encapsulating in that was the idea in the Catholic faith that allows people to act according to their conscience, even Catholic politicians.<\/p> <p> On the issue of abortion in Northern Ireland, I have had not had any discussions with religious leaders about that particular matter.  I understand the representatives of the major Catholic and Protestant churches have encouraged the parties to form an Executive and Assembly in order to prevent that law from being applied to Northern Ireland.  This is perhaps with a view to applying a different law which would not go as far as is currently likely to happen in the next few weeks.  That is very much a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive to decide on, however, based on the principles of devolution and local democracy.<\/p> <p> Deputy Coppinger referred to the availability of abortion services across the State.  The referendum was just over a year ago and the legislation was passed towards the end of last year.  It was never the case that services were going to start right away.  It always takes time to phase in new health services.  It is encouraging, however, that there are now 340 general practitioners, GPs, providing abortion services across the country.  If one considers that there are approximately 4,000 terminations of pregnancy a year in Ireland, that is a doctor-patient ratio of 1:12.  If each of those doctors performed maybe ten terminations a year, that is enough to cover the service.  Accordingly, 340 GPs providing the service is quite a lot when one considers that only about 4,000 terminations of pregnancy are sought every year.<\/p> <p> When it comes to hospitals, I am not sure if it is down to conscientious objections.  I will have to check up on that.  There may be other reasons in different hospitals.  It might be down to the volumes of referrals or staff training.  Irish doctors and nurses are not trained to perform surgical abortions.  If they are willing to do so, they would have to be trained.  It might not simply be down to conscientious objection.  It is in one hospital for sure but it is something I will have to look into a little bit further.<\/p> <p> On the church-State dialogue process, the idea behind the new covenant and the new relationship is that it is a matter which church and State should figure out together.  It should not be designed or invented by one side.  In many ways, I am not sure how it is going to turn out yet.  The opportunity of the plenary was to have that discussion with the church bodies and religious bodies as to how they think it should turn out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500017#P00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571151600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Was it just a good idea for a speech?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500018#Q00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1571151600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I think it was a good idea quite frankly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500018#Q00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571151600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>If it is not fleshed out, then no one knows what it means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500018#Q00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1571151600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>When one has a good idea, often the best thing is to talk to the stakeholders and not impose it on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500018#Q00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571151600,"counter":158,"content":"<p>It is best to just announce it, if it sounds good at the time.

This unit works closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which has lead responsibility in this area.  It focuses on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management, as well as communications on Brexit preparedness.<\/p>  <p>  The economic division includes officials with a range of relevant economic qualifications.  These include specialist staff recruited as part of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, as well as staff with either PhD or masters qualifications in economic or other relevant policy disciplines, along with others with extensive experience dealing with economic and related policy issues.<\/p>  <p>  The division assists the work of three Cabinet committees and associated senior officials groups.  The Cabinet committee on the economy is responsible for all issues relating to the economy, including Future Jobs Ireland.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery and ongoing development of policy across the areas of infrastructure investment and delivery, Project Ireland 2040 and Rebuilding Ireland.  The Cabinet committee on the environment deals with issues relating to the environment, including the climate action plan.<\/p>  <p>  The economic division leads Ireland's participation in the annual European semester.  It prepares the annual national risk assessment which provides an opportunity to identify and consider strategic risks on a structured basis.  The 2019 national risk assessment was published in August.  It also liaises with the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>  <p>  The division, in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, leads the Future Jobs Ireland initiative.  This aims to ensure we are well-placed to meet future challenges facing the economy with a focus on quality and sustainable jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The division provides me with briefing and speech material on economic and related policy issues.

How can the Taoiseach possibly justify that, particularly when tax breaks, such as the special assignee relief programme, were retained?  A tax break that benefits 789 of the richest and best paid people in this country allows them to have 30% of their extremely high incomes tax free and get the fees paid for their children.  For example, according to Revenue, there are four persons earning between &euro;3 million and &euro;10 million a year getting this tax break, as are 14 earning between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million and 26 earning between &euro;675,000 and &euro;1 million.

The deal, which appears to be in the process of being discussed this week and last and negotiated now, involves a full hard Brexit for Great Britain and a softer Brexit for Northern Ireland.  That may be all that is achievable.  It is important that we are clear about what is involved in terms of the east-west dimension.  That depends on the full trade agreement that ultimately has to be negotiated between Britain and Europe.  Right now, we are at the exit stage.  It seems Britain is now leaving the customs union, as opposed to the withdrawal agreement where the UK as a whole was in the customs union.  That is potentially significant for east-west trade, where the bulk of the trade goes on.

This included the establishment of a new Cabinet committee on the environment.  The Cabinet committee on the environment covers issues relating to the environment, including climate action and the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan.<\/p>  <p>  Political and popular momentum for necessary climate action is growing and Government is listening.  This was reflected in the Government&rsquo;s publication of the cross-sectoral climate action plan in June 2019 and the strong focus on climate and environmental matters in budget 2020.  Given the cross-cutting nature of the climate action plan that affects all aspects of the economy and society, the need for an all-of-Government approach to climate action is obvious.  This includes a deliberate and sustained focus by all relevant Ministers and Departments.  The work of the Cabinet committee on the environment is an important part of this.  The committee met for the first time on 30 September 2019 and is due to meet again at least once more before the year end.  At its first meeting, it discussed the first progress report on the climate action plan, which will be published in the next few weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500020#S02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1571152800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is not exactly acting as if his house is on fire given that the committee is due to meet only once before the end of the year.

Yesterday, I drove my daughter to the bus stop to get a bus to school because the rain was so heavy.  Along the way, I saw dozens of schoolchildren and workers waiting at every single bus stop.  In the 15 minutes that my daughter waited no bus arrived, but that is another story.  This drove home to me the futility of introducing a carbon tax when people do not have an alternative means of getting to and from school or work.  There has been no alternative investment in public transport.  Blanchardstown is a large suburb of the capital city where a large number of multinational companies are located.  Every day, 30,000 people drive in and out of the area as they come and go to work, yet the transport system is creaking at the seams.  The Government has not brought forward a proposal for a Luas line running from, say, Broombridge to Blanchardstown.

This is more of the unfair, regressive and dishonest approach to dealing with the climate emergency.  How are people supposed to retrofit their home if they live in a council house?  They cannot do so because they are not allowed to do so.  As such, how are these people supposed to reduce their energy bills?  They have to wait for the local authority to do the retrofit.  In my area, the local authority is retrofitting approximately 2% of the housing stock each year.  How is someone supposed to use more public transport when we have some of the lowest subsidies for public transport anywhere in Europe and, as Deputy Coppinger pointed out, which is true in my area also, people cannot get a bus in the morning because there are not enough buses in the fleet?  Where is the additional money to add an extra few hundred buses to the fleet?  Where is the money to reduce fares?  Did the Taoiseach ever see pensioners who have free travel?  They use public transport more because it is free.  If the Government wants to get people out of their cars and on to public transport, it should make public transport free.

The gist of its finding is that the current design of the new buses is inadequate for those using powered wheelchairs and those with limited dexterity when manoeuvring chairs within confined spaces.

The Taoiseach got a bit touchy about this and demanded a right of reply when <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>published an article claiming that the announcement was little more than tokenistic.  For all significant announcements about the environment, it is reasonable to assume that specific work will have been completed on defining the exact likely impact of each decision.  In this context, can the Taoiseach outline the specific impact on Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets that the announcement about oil exploration is likely to have?  When the much-delayed and over-hyped climate change plan was announced earlier this year, it was pointed out that the Government had not published any initiatives which were capable of delivering on some of the higher-profile targets.  For example, the target of having 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 requires that basically all new cars sold from today onwards be electric.  That clearly is not happening.  Anyone I have spoken to who knows anything about this matter has indicated that the target will be impossible to achieve.

However, there is an outstanding issue in regard to the injunctions.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to call on the processors, including C&amp;D Foods, which is owned by the ABP Food Group, to drop all injunctions.  While it says it is not party to the talks, and I am not trying to say it is, it is linked to a company that was party to the talks because it is part of ABP.  Considering this is a sector in which there are serious issues of trust between farmers and processors, what does it say if one of the processors will not comply with such a basic part of the agreement?  All disputes need to be resolved. <\/p>  <p>  It was also agreed that Bord Bia would develop beef market index models.  Will the Minister update us on the progress in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500022#U00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1571154000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>The talks process involved a large number of farm organisations and representatives of the meat industry, which was represented by Meat Industry Ireland, MII, in the negotiations which were brokered by myself and Department officials.

The full text of that agreement is available on my  Department's website.  The agreement involves a number of interventions which will provide immediate benefit for beef producers, as well as a range of strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.  Beef producers will benefit from an immediate increase in a range of bonuses.  This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus.  The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid.  A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the agreement.  These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef producer organisations which have the potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I have established a beef market task force to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.

There will also be an independent examination of the price composition of the total value of the animal, including the fifth quarter, along the supply chain and a summary of competition law issues as relevant to the Irish beef sector.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Bord Bia will develop a beef market price index model based on three components.  These are live cattle prices, the beef market price index for retail and wholesale and an offal price indicator.  Teagasc will also review the quality payment grid.  Additional commitments in the agreement include detailed price reporting on the Beef PriceWatch app, examination of transparency models in other jurisdictions and a consultation process on the transposition of the unfair trading practices directive.  Work on these commitments is under way and progress will be reported via the beef task force set up to oversee the implementation of the agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The task force is comprised of key beef sector stakeholders, with Mr. Michael Dowling as independent chair.  The beef task force scheduled for yesterday, 14 October, was adjourned, as members of the task force were prevented from attending the meeting.  It is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef industry that the work of the task force should go ahead.  The task force's remit is to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from the agreement reached on 15 September and it offers the most viable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders.  It was a great pity that farm representatives were not in a position to air the legitimate concerns of farmers at the task force meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500024#W00800","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1571155200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The base price for a premium product is far below the cost of production and there should be a statutory investigation into what is going on in the beef industry.

This agreement covers the types of issues raised in the D&aacute;il motion of 26 September.<\/p>  <p>  The full text of the agreement between beef sector stakeholders is on my Department website.  The agreement involves a number of interventions which will provide immediate benefit for beef farmers as well as a range of strategic measures which seek to address structural imbalances in the sector.  Beef producers will benefit from an immediate increase in a range of bonuses.  This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals as well as significantly increasing the number of animals which are eligible for a bonus.  The cumulative effect is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered will now be eligible for a bonus on top of the basic price paid.  A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the agreement.  These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.  My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef producer organisations, which have the potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I have established a beef market task force to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.

Furthermore, the task force will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.  The task force is also the appropriate forum for considering issues such as the potential of blockchain in the sector.  I have appointed Michael Dowling as chairperson of the task force.  Members include representatives from my Department, State agencies, farm organisations and the meat industry.  As Deputy Naughten is aware, the task force was supposed to meet yesterday but that meeting did not proceed.  I expect he shares my view that this was entirely regrettable.

This will increase the level of bonus being paid on certain animals as well as significantly increasing the number of animals that are eligible for a bonus.  The cumulative effect is that over 70% of steers and heifers slaughtered will be eligible for a bonus on top of the base price paid.  A number of actions in the areas of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain are included in the agreement.  These measures set a course towards greater clarity for all stakeholders involved in the beef supply chain, primarily farmers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is proactively engaging with several potential beef producer organisations, which have the potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  A constant refrain, of which I am sure Members are aware, is that farmers are price takers.  Beef producer organisations enable farmers to work collaboratively together, control supply of a significant volume of beef and, from that position of strength, negotiate with processors on the basis of an agreed price and sharing some of the risk involved in rearing cattle over a prolonged period.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  A beef market task force has been established to provide the leadership to develop a sustainable pathway for the future of the beef sector in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability.  The task force will provide a robust implementation structure for commitments entered into in the agreement, with timelines and stakeholder engagement.  Furthermore, it will offer a suitable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including retailers and regulatory authorities.  It is chaired by Michael Dowling.  It was scheduled to meet yesterday but the meeting was adjourned because members of the task force were prevented from attending it.  It is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef industry that the work of the task force goes ahead.  Its remit is to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from the agreement reached on 15 September and it offers the most viable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders.  It was a great pity that farm representatives were not in a position to air the legitimate concerns of farmers at the task force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500027#Z00700","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1571157000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>The plight of beef farmers has come centre stage as a result of protests and people power.

Although I have not taken formal legal advice on it, I suspect it may not be legally possible to state that one may not own a particular enterprise here.  The task force is in a position to consider the issue of feedlot ownership.  However, feedlots controlled by beef processors do not control the overwhelming majority of cattle that are slaughtered.  To some extent, it depends on what one defines as significant.  The definition of \"feedlot\" also deserves consideration.  Some feedlots are owned by farmers who trade independently.  It is an area in which we must maintain constant vigilance.<\/p>  <p>  As the task force will comprise representatives of all stakeholders, it is a very welcome development that can look at all of these issues and build trust and understanding on issues about which there has been too much mystique, such as what is happening in the marketplace or who is getting what in the market.

The Government should clearly state that the injunctions and threats of legal action against farmers fighting for their livelihood should be lifted.  I urge the Minister to look seriously at the issue because what we are talking about is a financial connection between the processors who dominate the market and the feedlots that essentially allow them to put goods onto the market and, as such, depress the price.

It appears that almost on a daily basis, nearly every one of this country's 5 million citizens tells farmers what they should do and how they should do it.  Farmers seem to be admonished if they do not do things to the highest standard.  It is the same right across Europe, where every day of the week 450 million citizens seem to tell farmers what to do.

It is important to keep emphasising the partnership that has existed between CAP and European society as we seek to ensure that the CAP budget is prioritised at all times.  It is not just about transferring funds to the farming sector - it is also about ensuring we have a vibrant rural community.

As he knows, unanimity is required for an EU budget.  We have to convince some other member states that have differing views on how Europe, and new challenges in Europe, should be funded.  Our view is that Europe should not be funded by raiding CAP, which has been a successful common policy in the area of agriculture.  The obvious challenges that need to be addressed collectively in other areas, including migration and security, which are readily recognised as important challenges we need to face together, should not be used as a reason to rob the budget for CAP, which is working really well to deliver safe food and many other public goods that are demanded by society in respect of matters such as biodiversity and water quality.  The policy needs to reflect the fact that farmers are the solution rather than the problem here.

It is important to reflect that the ICES advice is informed by bodies like the Marine Institute, which conducts research in our areas on our behalf and is involved in the general advice that is available to the Commission for the December Council or indeed for the allocation of mackerel quotas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500029#BB01000","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571158800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I emphasise the importance of ensuring that it is off the ICES advice regarding the figure of 955,000 this year.

Work on the development of this index is under way and progress on this will be reported via the beef task force, which was set up to oversee the implementation of the commitments agreed to at the recent beef talks.<\/p>  <p>  The task force comprises key beef sector stakeholders, with Michael Dowling as independent chair.  The beef task force meeting scheduled for yesterday, 14 October, was adjourned, as members of the task force were prevented from attending the meeting.  It is in the interests of everyone involved in the beef industry that the work of the task force goes ahead.  The task force&rsquo;s remit is to monitor the implementation of the actions arising from the agreement reached on 15 September.  It offers the most viable platform for strategic engagement with key stakeholders.  It was a great pity that farm representatives were not in a position to air the legitimate concerns of farmers at the task force.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement of 15 September sets out strategic measures that will seek to address structural imbalances and enhance transparency in the sector.  A number of actions in the area of market transparency, beef promotion and strengthening the position of the farmer in the supply chain were agreed.  <\/p>  <p>  I do not intend to read out the agreement in full as the text is available on the Department's website.  I am satisfied that it contains the best balance of immediate financial benefits for farmers and a series of more medium-term strategic actions.  The best approach to supporting the sector, especially in the current context of Brexit uncertainty, is by providing a strong basis of financial support to primary producers, providing supply chain strengthening mechanisms such as producer organisations and ensuring as broad a range of markets to sell product to as possible. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also proactively engaging with several potential beef producer organisations, which have to potential to strengthen the bargaining power of beef farmers in the supply chain.  Two beef producer organisations have been formally recognised by my Department in recent weeks.  I firmly believe that producer organisations constitute an important part of the toolkit in building resilience in the sector by re-balancing power along the supply chain.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500030#CC00600","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1571158800,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The Minister left out the piece that stated that it was to have been introduced in the week commencing 16 September.

I will first give Members some background information on the programme.  The SCP is a targeted school and community support service.  It aims to support keeping young people in education through to the leaving certificate, equivalent qualification or suitable level of educational attainment, which enables them to transition into further education, training or employment.  It delivers a range of local interventions in disadvantaged communities and enables those communities to develop strategies which are adapted to maximise the participation levels of those at risk of early school leaving.  This involves working with individual young people of schoolgoing age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  I know from my own experience working in the area of educational disadvantage that factors from outside the educational environment often cause young people to drop out of education.<\/p>  <p>  Some 124 SCP projects are currently running, covering 467 primary schools and 224 post-primary schools.  The SCP is a key support under the DEIS programme and is operated by Tusla's educational welfare service, EWS.  My Department works with that service to ensure the necessary resources are available to support the programme and ensure that staffing levels are sufficient to deliver a high quality service to those young people most at risk of early school leaving.  Currently, the funding available to SCP projects for the 2019-2020 school year stands at &euro;24.7 million.  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that I prioritised this service and secured an additional &euro;500,000 in resources in budget 2019, which will be maintained in budget 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Two school completion programmes are currently operating in the north Clondalkin area, namely, the Quarryvale Balgaddy SCP and the Collinstown SCP.  A total of &euro;559,765 is allocated to these north Clondalkin SCP projects annually.  The educational welfare service of Tusla has informed my Department that there have been no funding cuts to the Quarryvale Balgaddy and Collinstown SCPs, which work with children and young people at risk of early school leaving in north Clondalkin.  I assure the Deputies that no cuts to funding are planned.  The local management committees of these SCPs and the Get Ahead Club, along with the educational welfare service, participated in and supported a process to resolve governance concerns relating to the SCPs' funding and a third-party arrangement with the Get Ahead Club.  All three local groups agreed on a plan dealing with these concerns in order to allow SCP funding to continue to meet the needs of local children and young people who want to attend, participate in and complete their education.  This process has ensured that the total available budget of &euro;559,765 is effectively used to meet the needs of those most vulnerable to leaving school early and not meeting their potential in the communities of north Clondalkin.  Tusla EWS has no funding responsibility for other services being provided through the Get Ahead Club, such as community employment schemes.  I am confident that the hard work being carried out by SCPs in the area will continue to have a positive impact on the lives of the young people they support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500031#DD00200","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1571159400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>That is an incredibly frustrating response because it sidesteps the core issue about which we are asking.

These are some of the most disadvantaged children in our community.  As far as we understand, those services have not been provided since September of this year.  I am not stating that the club should continue just as it was before but I want to know whether funding is still available from Tusla to ensure that those services are provided regardless of the governance arrangements.

Home supports enable older people to remain in their own homes and communities, as well as facilitating timely discharge from hospital.  As outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2019, the HSE maximises the utilisation of current resources prioritising those requiring discharge from acute hospitals.  Significant resources and services in 2019 have been targeted to facilitate timely egress.  Last winter the focus was on reducing delayed patient discharges through mobilising the additional resources made available, as well as ensuring social care measures were effectively deployed to enable older people to move to a more appropriate care setting, including to step-down or transitional care or their own home with the supports they need.<\/p>  <p>  The national service plan for 2019 sets a target to deliver 18.26 million hours to over 53,000 people, including 360,000 hours as part of an intensive home care package.  By the end of July, more than 10 million hours of home support had been delivered nationally with almost 52,000 people in receipt of the service.  The most recent preliminary data available indicates this has increased to over 11.8 million hours by the end of August.  Despite this significant level of provision, demand for home support continues to grow and nationally over 7,000 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional services.  Arrangements for home supports have developed over the years with a significant local focus.  It is acknowledged by the HSE that there may be a considerable variation in access to services in different parts of the country.  The recent report from the ESRI, published in July of this year, Geographic Profile of Healthcare Needs and Non-Acute Healthcare Supply in Ireland, highlighted this variation across counties and regions.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE has assured the Department that people on the waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within available resources.  They are also determined by the local front-line staff who know and understand the clients' needs and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure the services being provided remain appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the programme for Government, we have made improved access to home support services a priority in budget 2020.  An additional investment of &euro;52 million is being made in 2020 which will provide over 19.2 million hours of home support.  This is 1 million hours more than the 2019 target, representing a substantial increase in service provision.  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home.  As appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for older people.<\/p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.  The Department of Health is developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services for older people and adults with a disability.  Included in this investment is dedicated funding for the testing of the new statutory home support scheme in 2020.  The design of the new scheme will involve the establishment of a model of service with a streamlined central system of administration to improve and simplify how people access home-support services.  While the administration of the scheme will be centralised, the delivery of services will be co-ordinated at local level in line with a person's assessed need.  This scale of investment clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing the issue through the introduction of standardised assessments, as well as additional resourcing which will go a long way towards the elimination of waiting lists and piloting of the new statutory scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500032#EE00500","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1571160000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>The Minister of State used the words &ldquo;priority&rdquo; and &ldquo;targeted&rdquo;, yet Wexford, with the third worst waiting list for home care package provision, has the fastest growing list.

It is not about money alone.  Money alone will not solve this problem.  I have stated that on the record of this House.  While I got an additional &euro;52 million in this year's budget, if I got an additional &euro;152 million, I could not wipe out the current waiting list.<\/p>  <p>  While I do not intimately understand the Wexford situation and Deputy Browne will appreciate that I do not manage the services at a local level, the issues in Wexford that are making it particularly acute are the supply of labour in many areas and getting people to deliver the service.  That is why we have the postcode lottery, which is less than satisfactory, and that is why we have committed funding.  From a financial point of view, three or four years ago it was &euro;300 million a year.  Now it is &euro;450 million a year.  That is a 50% increase in funding.  We could keep doing that, for instance, adding another &euro;52 million onto it this year.  We can keep putting &euro;50 million on every year.  That, in itself, will not do.  What we need is a centralised system that makes sure that it is fair and equitable throughout the country.  That is what the Deputies are saying loud and clear.  It is irritating if one represents Wexford, as Deputy Browne does, where there is a waiting list of 700 and a neighbouring county has a waiting list that is not half or a quarter as severe.<\/p>  <p>  There are 7,000 people waiting nationally.  That is not acceptable.  I am on the record as stating that I am embarrassed at that waiting list.  That is why I have committed to developing a statutory scheme that will be underpinned in law, like the fair deal scheme, so that everybody who needs it will get it.  We will have a single assessment tool so that everybody's level of need will be assessed in a fair way no matter whether one lives in Donegal, west Cork or anywhere in between.  We will also have it fully funded and make sure that there is adequate funding there.  I will test a pilot of that next year.  This is not something we are talking about in the never-never.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Troy asked when the additional 1 million hours that are the result of this year's budget will come on stream.  I acknowledge the contribution of the confidence and supply agreement to that budget and the input of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to ensuring that this area got funding.  I thank the party's Deputies for that.  That is appreciated.  Certainly, it is helpful at my end.  Those 1 million hours will come on stream on 1 January and will be allocated.  As I stated, a part of that will be running a pilot of the new statutory scheme, which will be unveiled in January of next year - I will be telling people exactly how it will look - and it is to be hoped it will be brought in the following January.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have figures for Deputy O'Loughlin on respite.  That is a separate issue to home help.  Respite is delivered through the community nursing units.  It is managed locally by each individual community healthcare organisation, CHO.  If Deputy O'Loughlin wants me to get particular figures on that for Kildare, she should by all means contact my office or send me an email.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500033#FF00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1571160600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I accept that, but that was the question I submitted on respite.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500033#FF00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","time":1571160600,"counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500033#FF00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1571160600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue this evening.<\/p>  <p>  This may seem a complicated, convoluted and extensive issue, but in fact it is not.  It is simple.  The problems of traffic congestion in Maynooth that exist at present are severe and affect not only the people of Maynooth and Kilcock but also those further afield who arrive in a traffic snarl-up on the motorway every day.  There are also ongoing realignment works on the roads within the town itself.  I accept that there will be disruption during reconstruction of any description - one cannot have an omelette without breaking eggs - but the extent of such disruption could be alleviated to some extent with a little attention.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, one realignment of a road has taken the most serious turn that I have ever seen.  I do not know who designed it, but the footpath goes in a particular direction and, all of sudden, veers out into the middle of the carriageway for I know not what purpose.  Unless the draftsman at the time had some particular obsession with that, somebody should go back and have a look at it again.  It is the most ridiculous design I have seen.<\/p>  <p>  There is a simple resolution in the sense that &euro;14.5 million was awarded by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government three years ago to provide for the strategic infrastructure needed for the housing shortage in the area and that is available and ready.  The housing development has taken off, so to speak, and is going well.  It is now about ready for the two stages of that particular proposal to be activated.  I ask that that would be done at the earliest possible date.<\/p>  <p>  Some works have been activated.  There is a noise abatement surface proposed for the motorway.  I hope that is done in conjunction with whatever upgrading works will be done and that the road will not be uprooted once again.<\/p>  <p>  I would especially emphasise that the capacity of the motorway is long past its maximum and there needs to be something done as a matter of urgency.  We hear every morning there is either a crash or a hold-up and the traffic is backed up for four or five miles.  There starts the next part of the problem, which is that the traffic coming from Enfield and Mullingar leaves the motorway at Kilcock and returns to the old road, heading towards Maynooth, jamming up the traffic in Maynooth that is already in a bad situation.  There is traffic sprayed out in all directions from there, so to speak, creating serious problems and the use of the minor roads.<\/p>  <p>  The responsibility is divided between two Ministers, the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government, who are not here, but to whom the Minister of State will bring the message with a view to ensuring that the works required are taken in hand immediately and any possibility of doing something in the short term is seized on straight away.<\/p>  <p>  The motorway has worked well up to now but it is now incapable of dealing with the volume of traffic.  It will remain a problem, just the same as the problem on the N7-N9 for the past ten years.  My philosophy in these matters is that if we deal with them in the beginning, we will not have to moan about them in the future.  I would say that is an issue that needs to be dealt with quickly.  There are two interchanges that are also needed, one of which is a second interchange off the motorway which will greatly resolve the traffic problems and is proposed and provided for already by the local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500033#FF00600","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1571160600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>I am very much surrounded by Kildare Deputies in the House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500033#FF00700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1571160600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is surrounded by better people.

Summary details of these projects and the projected housing to be delivered were made available in March 2018 and are published on the Rebuilding Ireland website at .<\/p><p>LIHAF is designed to activate housing supply by putting in place enabling public infrastructure by unlocking lands to facilitate large-scale development on key sites.  Infrastructure being funded under LIHAF includes access roads, distributor roads, link roads, road improvements, roundabouts, bridges and parks.  The 30 infrastructure projects are expected to provide infrastructure for the delivery thereafter of 20,000 housing units.  Approximately 5,600 or 28% of these will be social or affordable, another 5,600 will have a cost reduction on open market prices, and the remainder will be sold at market rates.  A total of 1,489 housing units have been delivered to date under LIHAF, and this is expected to rise to more than 6,000 by the end of 2020.<\/p><p> LIHAF funding of &euro;14.5 million has been made to support a roads project in Maynooth - 75% grant funding of &euro;10.88 million matched by 25% local authority funding.  The project comprises the construction of a 1.5 km section of roadway linking the Dublin Road and the Straffan Road in Maynooth, improvement works at the junction of the Straffan, Leixlip and Celbridge roads, a new railway bridge and a new canal bridge.  The road will also include a cycleway, footpaths on both sides of the road and a number of roundabouts along the route of the road, which will help to control traffic speed.  This project allows for significant development to take place in Maynooth.<\/p> <p> The project is currently at route selection stage and was approved by the council in July 2019.  The consultants are working with Kildare County Council and have produced a route selection report.  Compulsory purchase order, CPO, documentation is being progressed in parallel by Kildare County Council and is expected to be published by early December 2019.  Kildare County Council has confirmed to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government that the infrastructure works will be ready to go to tender in the first quarter of 2020, subject to approval by the Department, with an award of tender in the second quarter of 2020.  Construction duration is estimated at 18 months, which will see the infrastructure completed by the fourth quarter of 2021.<\/p> <p> Regarding the housing to be delivered, a strategic housing development application for LIHAF housing is due to be lodged by the developer at the end of November 2019.  Subject to planning approval, the developer expects to be on site by mid-2020 to coincide with the commencement of the infrastructure works.<\/p> <p> Under LIHAF, 800 additional homes will be delivered in Maynooth, including 720 cost reduced units over the span of the project with a cost reduction of &euro;18,000 per cost reduced unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500033#FF01000","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571161200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, which deals in detail with the issues and will, I hope, result in an early date for the project.

During the downturn in the economy, we did not have traffic problems anywhere but we have them now.  We may be the victims of our own success but whatever the reasons, they are positive.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of population, Maynooth is not the biggest town in the country by any stretch of the imagination.  However, there are now almost 17,000 students in Maynooth University.  We also have two schools off the Moyglare Road, each with a student population of 1,000.  We have a number of other schools on the Celbridge Road.  We have schools all over and a Gaelchol&aacute;iste is promised in the near future.  All of that serves to concentrate the traffic in a particular area.  The issue can be resolved and the Minister of State referred to the solutions.  I thank previous Ministers for their investment in the town, which will stand it in good stead for the population in the future.  I hope, however, that we do not have a long, drawn out process, similar to what we had with the N7 and the N9 projects, which went on for years.

I understand he will bring the points I am raising back to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who cannot be here this evening.<\/p>  <p>  The aspect of the housing assistance payment, HAP, I want to focus on is a serious problem that seems to have dramatically worsened in the past two or three months, namely, the delay in having a HAP application processed.  This in addition to the lack of flexibility shown in cases where rents are very high and the HAP is not sufficient to cover them, meaning people have to try to source accommodation in a very limited sector.  In the past few months, the delay in processing an application has become dramatically worse and now averages nine weeks.  One can find a situation where a family will find a landlord who will accept the HAP.  However, when they get the contracts and present the application they are told the process will take nine weeks.  Several people have told me they have been told to pay the rent in the interim.  Who, in his or her right mind, would say that?  If people had several thousand euro in their bank account, they would not be looking for a housing assistance payment.  It is absolutely mad.  These people do not have money to pay rent in the interim.  The delay has got dramatically worse.<\/p>  <p>  Another major concern I hear expressed all the time is that when people borrow the money they do not feel secure about getting the money back because they will have demonstrated an ability to pay it.  This issue is adding to the stress.  Landlords are also left in limbo because they do not know, if they have accommodated somebody with HAP, that the payment will be processed.  It would be enormously helpful if a letter was sent out confirming that people are approved.<\/p>  <p>  I speak to a number of estate agents, and I had cause to speak to one particular letting agent, who I know is very good at sourcing accommodation and encouraging landlords to take HAP tenants.  He spoke about having very good experiences and not having an issue.  However, he feels he has been left with egg on face because he recommended HAP but it is taking so long to process it that landlords are coming back to him saying they are uncertain they will get paid.  It is perfectly legitimate and legal for a landlord to evict somebody in that scenario.  The letting agent told me that once a property is advertised in the north Kildare-west Dublin area, he expects to receive 150 or 160 emails within 24 hours, of which 70% would be from HAP tenants.  The remaining 30% of applicants have the best chance of securing that accommodation if the landlord knows he or she will have to wait nine or ten weeks to have the HAP payment processed.<\/p>  <p>  I have come across several cases where people who have been told to leave accommodation subsequently find other accommodation and then have to reapply for HAP.  When we ring the office in Limerick we are told the reason for the delay is that a large number of additional applications have been received.  Is there a large number of additional applications?  Is the problem a shortage of money or a staffing issue?  What is causing the problem because the situation is chaotic at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500034#GG00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1571161200,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500034#GG00700","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1571161800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue to which I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.<\/p>  <p>  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is deemed to be a social housing support under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014.  As a long-term housing support, an assessment of housing need must first be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP.  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter than the statutory maximum in many areas.  Once this process is complete and the housing need is confirmed, the household is eligible for HAP.<\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector and the tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord.  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.  If a household moves into a property before their housing needs assessment has been carried out by the local authority they may not be eligible for support under the HAP scheme for the duration before a complete and valid application is submitted.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP application form comes in two parts, section A to be completed by the applicant tenant and section B to be completed by the landlord or agent.  An application for HAP will only be accepted by the local authority when both section A and section B are completed, signed and returned, along with the required supporting documentation.  Any delay in tenants and landlords supplying this information, inaccuracies or missing information will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.  The earliest date a HAP payment to the landlord will apply from is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  HAP application validation times within local authorities may vary.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP shared service centre.  Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities and manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  On average, HAP applications are processed by the HAP Shared Services Centre within two working days of receipt.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500035#HH00100","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1571161800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister of State to ring the Limerick office.

It can take another eight or nine weeks to process a HAP application.  What is happening is potentially adding to the homeless crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The way HAP is being applied is problematic.  In some local authorities the uplift of the 20% for a person who is in a homeless situation is not being applied.  From my experience of its application in Kildare, it has been very patchy.  <\/p>  <p>  The delays in HAP payments are sending the message to landlords that they should stay away from this scheme.

That is how politics works and the reason we have this House is to bring information on what is happening on the ground back into the system and to the attention of the officials and civil servants to make sure they are aware of it.<\/p>  <p>  If there are delays at the validation stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was provided by the eligible household.  The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay.  The HAP scheme has been structured in a way that most protects Exchequer funding by ensuring payment issues only on valid and complete applications.  For this reason rent is paid in arrears and ensures that money is only paid in respect of time that the property has been occupied by the tenant.  This practice also avoids the situation where the local authority has to attempt to recover money from the landlord and simplifies the administration of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  With approximately 72,000 households on our waiting lists, the combination of more than 50,000 social housing homes and 88,000 HAP and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, supports, which will be funded by the Government out to 2021, means that both long-term and flexible options will be available to those on our social housing waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of quarter 2 2019, there were more than 48,000 households in receipt of HAP support and more than 28,000 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality waived prelegislative scrutiny because of the urgency of the Bill in view of our commitment to introduce the leave and benefit with effect from 1 November 2019.  I am very grateful to the committee for this and we, for our part, have endeavoured to present to the House what I believe is a well-considered proposal which expands significantly the family leave available to new parents.  We have had regard also to the need to minimise the burden that this will bring for employers.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides for parent's leave of two weeks' duration, which can be increased to a maximum of nine weeks by order of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It also provides for the payment of parent's benefit where the parent fulfils the relevant eligibility conditions.  No sharing of leave is permitted, as we want fathers to avail of the leave to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 defines \"relevant parent\", that is, the person who will be entitled to parent's leave.  A relevant parent, in the case of an adopted child, is, one, the adopting mother or sole male adopter of the child; two, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the adopting mother or sole male adopter; or, three, where the child is adopted jointly by a married couple of the same sex, a couple that are civil partners of each other, or a cohabiting couple of the same sex, each of the couple, and, in cases other than adoption, the term means, one, a parent of the child; two, the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a parent; or, three, a parent under section 5 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 where the child is a donor-conceived child.  In some situations, more than two people can be relevant parents, for example, where the parents are not married to each other and either or both parents are married to other people.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 creates the entitlement to paid leave for a relevant parent of a child who is adopted or born on or after 1 November 2019.  The purpose of the leave is to enable the parent to provide, or assist in the provision of, care to the child.  Therefore, a person may be a relevant parent but will not be entitled to the leave if he or she is not fulfilling this purpose.  Leave can be taken as a continuous period or in minimum periods of one week.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 provides that the relevant parent shall give the employer six weeks' notice of the intention to take parent's leave.  This is so that an employer can plan for the potential disruption that may arise when the employee takes the leave.<\/p>  <p>  Section 7 provides that the leave shall be taken in the first year of the child's life or, in the case of adoption, in the year after placement.  Notwithstanding this, the period is extended where the parent cannot take the leave where the leave is postponed for specified reasons such as where it is postponed by the employer.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 8 to 10 provide for the sequencing of types of leave where a parent is entitled to more than one type of leave.  The general approach is that maternity, adoptive and paternity leave are to be taken first as they are inherently related to the event of birth or adoption.   <\/p><p>As parent's leave is for the care of the child over the first year of life, it should naturally follow the other forms of leave.<\/p> <p> Section 13 provides for postponement of leave at the initiative of the employer where the taking of leave would have a substantial adverse effect on the business or organisation.  An example of this would be where there are seasonal peaks.  The postponement may last up to a maximum of 12 weeks.  Postponement under this section can only take place once in respect of each period of leave.<\/p> <p> Section 14 provides that the parent may request the employer to postpone leave if the child is hospitalised.  This reflects similar provisions in the legislation on maternity, adoptive and paternity leave.<\/p> <p> Section 15 provides for continuation of entitlement to leave where the child dies.  Maternity, adoptive and paternity leave operate in this way too.<\/p> <p> Section 16 provides for the entitlement of an employed surviving parent to the untaken leave if a parent dies.  The transfer of leave on death is also a feature of maternity, adoptive and paternity leave.<\/p> <p> Section 19 provides for the protection of employees from penalisation if they propose to exercise or have exercised their entitlement to parent's leave.  This is a standard provision in family leave legislation.<\/p> <p> Section 20 contains a general right to return to work on the same terms and conditions that applied prior to the parent taking leave.<\/p> <p> Part 4 deals with resolution of disputes and these can be referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p> <p> Part 5 provides for the introduction and payment of parent's benefit in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Section 29 introduces a new Chapter 11B to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which sets out the general qualifying conditions for receipt of parent's benefit payable for two weeks to employees and the self-employed, the required social insurance contributions, which are aligned with the requirement in place for maternity and paternity benefit, and the weekly rate of benefit payable, which is also in line with that for maternity and paternity leave, that is, &euro;245 per week at present.  The benefit will be payable in a continuous period or in individual blocks of one week.<\/p> <p> Part 6 contains miscellaneous provisions, many of them technical, including consequential amendments of other Acts.<\/p> <p> I have described the provisions in the Bill.  I now want to mention two provisions that are not in the Bill because of the pressure of time in bringing it to enactment before 1 November.  These provisions relate, first, to adoptive leave for male same-sex married couples and, second, to the extension of breastfeeding breaks.<\/p> <p> We are all agreed on the principle of enabling same-sex couples who are adopting jointly to be able to take adoptive leave.  The general scheme of this Bill, published in April, proposed to address the lacuna whereby a married male same-sex couple cannot avail of adoptive leave.  As currently constituted, the Adoptive Leave Act 2005 essentially only allows an adopting mother to take adoptive leave.  The adopting father, other than a sole male adopter, is entitled to adoptive leave only where the adopting mother dies.  Over the course of drafting, it became apparent that, in seeking to address an inequality, another inequality could be created.  It would be unfair not to reform the adoptive leave regime to allow opposite-sex couples the same choice as to which of them should take adoptive leave.<\/p> <p> My Department is working on provisions which will give all adopting couples, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, the right to select which of them will be the qualified adopter, that is, which will get adoptive leave and benefit.  In my view, giving the option to select the qualified adopter to same-sex couples only would be discriminatory as, unlike the situation with maternity, there is no biological reason it is always the adopting mother who gets adoptive leave.<\/p> <p> Introducing this reform is complex.  This is why it was decided to insert these provisions into a later Bill so as not to jeopardise the enactment of the Parent's Leave and Benefit Bill by 1 November.  I am acutely conscious of the many parents waiting to take parent's leave.  It is important that they should not have to wait longer for this important entitlement.<\/p> <p> A number of amendments were tabled on this matter and have been ruled out of order.  I would think that Deputies Martin Kenny, John Brady, Jim O'Callaghan and I are on the same page as far as eliminating the anomaly regarding, in particular, male same-sex married couples is concerned.  However, I do not want to end one form of discrimination by creating another.  Therefore, we are looking at more extensive amendments to the legislation than I think the Deputies envisaged.<\/p> <p> As regards timescale, the Government has been informed of the aim to insert these provisions into a forthcoming Bill, ideally the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill which will be before the House in November and the purpose of which is to give effect to measures in the budget.  I plan to present legislative proposals in this regard to Government next week.<\/p> <p> The other measure that has arisen is a provision to extend the period during which breastfeeding breaks can be taken from 26 weeks to two years.  This is a commitment in First 5, the strategy for the first five years of a child's life.  The extension of breastfeeding breaks is also an action in the national strategy for women and girls.  Work is under way in my Department on legislative proposals in this regard.<\/p> <p> I hope this information is of assistance to the House.  In conclusion, I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500035#HH00500","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571162400,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Callaghan, who is sharing with Deputies O'Loughlin and Murphy O'Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500036#JJ00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1571162400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  However, I do not think it is helpful that we have to take all Stages of the legislation within three hours.  It is very important legislation and while we welcome it, as legislators, we should be given an opportunity to consider it, table amendments and have them discussed in due course, and then reflect on the Second Stage debate with other affected members of the community who may have contributions to make to us in light of the debate that took place in the House.  As they say, however, we are where we are.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact this legislation is coming in to provide for parental leave and benefit, which are both to be welcomed and both long overdue.  However, it has to be pointed out that there is a significant problem with this legislation in that it contains something much more than what the Minister of State describes as an anomaly.  It contains a discrimination against same-sex male couples who are married, and I believe we need to point that out.  It is a matter of concern to me that this legislation will go through the House with that piece of discrimination contained within it. <\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State is anxious to get this legislation enacted and I note what he says about bringing forward further legislation in November.  However, I want to remind the Minister of State, who I know is well-intentioned in these matters, of what the Government said when the scheme of this Bill was publicised for the first time last April.  It was stated that time by the Government that the Bill proposed to take \"the final steps needed to enable male same-sex couples to receive adoptive leave and benefit.  This is further progress towards ensuring equality for all families\".  We were given that commitment by the Government and also a specific commitment by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister, Deputy Doherty, but, alas, it is not within this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  We need to point that the legislation, as it stands, constitutes a form of discrimination against same-sex males who are in a relationship.  In that respect, they are treated differently from same-sex females who are in a marital relationship, so it is a form of gender discrimination against same-sex male couples.  Similarly, it is discriminatory because a straight man who is adopting would not find himself in the same position as gay men will find themselves in respect of seeking parent's benefit and leave, and so, in that regard, it is a form of sexual orientation-based discrimination. <\/p>  <p>  I do not think we can just brush this over by saying we will deal with it in due course.  It is highly regrettable, considering the steps this country has made in terms of equality for people who are gay in the past five to ten years, that we are introducing legislation that blocks out a section of them.  We should not try to gloss over this.  It is a concern to me and I know it is a concern to my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, we will support this legislation.  We had tabled amendments to deal with removing the discrimination against same-sex males.  Unfortunately, and there is no criticism of the Chair, they have been ruled out of order because it is contended they are charge on the Exchequer.  We are now left in a situation where we had tabled amendments but they have been ruled out of order and we cannot progress them.  At the same time, we have this useful legislation that we want to see enacted but it contains this discriminatory provision.  Nonetheless, we are going to support it while holding the Minister of State and the Government to account in order that they will bring forward the important legislation to remove this discrimination by November.  That has to be expedited.<\/p>  <p>  I have a lot of regard for the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, but my concern is that he is only at times in the driving seat of this Government.  When he is, things can get done but when he is not, other people let things drift to the back burner, and I am concerned this would be put on the back burner.<\/p>  <p>  In general, it has to be recognised that parents, irrespective of their gender or sexual orientation, need to spend more time with their children.  It is invaluable for a child to have the benefit of spending time with their parents when they are at a very young age.  The purpose of this legislation is to provide parental leave for parents when their children are under the age of one.  At present, the legislation provides for a period of two weeks parental leave and the payment of a parent's benefit.<\/p><p>It also provides that this can be increased to up to nine weeks.  We need to get away from the perception that life is all about work.  We need to recognise that parental responsibility does not rest, as it did traditionally, solely with the mother who brings up the children.  Irish families have become more complex and different over the years.  What is absolutely fundamental is that the parents of a child need to spend more time with that child because all the surveys and all the research indicate that the more time parents can spend with a child, the greater the benefit to the child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500036#JJ00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571163000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Like my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the Bill and to speak on it.  It is important that it provides each parent of a child under the age of one with two weeks' paid parental leave.  It is concerning, however, that the Bill, when it passes, will come into effect on 1 November, which is only two weeks away.  This does not really give employers a lot of time to put arrangements in place, which is extremely regrettable.<\/p>  <p>  When the general scheme of the Bill was published in April, it was promised that it would remedy a lacuna in law which meant that married gay fathers were not entitled to adoptive leave or benefit.  It is really bad that while the Government has been promising to rectify this, it is not happening.  We were very surprised when the Bill was published a week ago to see that that provision had disappeared.  While I have respect for the Minister of State, the excuse that the Government did not have time to draft the relevant provisions is simply not good enough.  This has very real consequences for the LGBT community, and it is completely discriminatory against gay fathers, and indeed their children, who would benefit, as we all know, from extra time with their parents, no matter their sex.  This legal loophole is not being rectified, and again, it is disappointing that the amendments Fianna F&aacute;il tabled to address it have been ruled out of order.  We absolutely want to work to ensure that this is addressed because it is important.<\/p>  <p>  The final point I will make concerns the shared maternity leave Bill that my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, and I introduced last year.  That Bill would provide for the sharing of maternity leave.  Again, this would be of great benefit to parents and we would like to see it progressed by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500037#KK00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1571163000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>As my colleagues have indicated, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the provisions of the Bill.  However, it needs to be more inclusive in order to ensure that all parents, no matter their sexual orientation, have equal access to this benefit.  Parents, no matter their sexual orientation, love their children, whether birth children or adopted children.  Those first few weeks of a baby's life are to be cherished, and the Bill needs to be inclusive to provide for all circumstances of both parents as well as to allow time for employers to adapt to these new measures.<\/p>  <p>  It appears that the Government has not engaged properly with employers in the drafting of the Bill.  The Minister of State advised the Seanad that the Government ran out of time when compiling the Bill.  This is clearly not good enough and simply a further example of how this Government is reactive rather than proactive.  The shared maternity benefit Bill, introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in July of last year, allows for maternity leave to be shared among parents - with the approval of the mothers, of course.  This is more in line with many EU countries where maternity leave is shared.  Such an approach is more in line with the hectic lifestyles of modern families living from day to day, and I ask the Minister of State to consider it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500037#KK00300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1571163000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  To see it moving through the various Stages represents progress.  I concur with Deputy O'Callaghan that it is unfortunate we find that it has been rushed in such a manner that it must go through all Stages together and that there is no opportunity to debate it properly and to go through it.  It is quite a piece of legislation, running to over 40 pages and making changes to much existing legislation.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that it must be considered in this manner.  Frankly, I do not understand why it could not have been progressed sooner in order that we could have had a proper and adequate opportunity to debate it on Committee Stage and all other Stages.  We are where we are, however, and we will support the Bill and want to see it come into force as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Like those from other parties, Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies tabled a number of amendments to various aspects of the Bill.  From the very beginning, it was considered that the Bill would cover every child born or adopted in 2019.  For this reason, we sought to have it come into force such that it would cover every child born or adopted from 1 January of this year.  The amendment in this regard was ruled out of order.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the clear problem with a male partner in a same-sex couple not being included in the Bill's provisions.  I spoke to the Minister of State earlier about all this and I thank him for his engagement.  He assures me, as he did in his speech, that this will be covered in the social welfare (No. 2) Bill and resolved in the next month to six weeks.  From my point of view, and I am sure from the point of view of others here, we will hold him to that in order to ensure it happens because it is important.  As previous speakers stated, it is a poor reflection on the current situation that any sector or individual would find himself or herself as an afterthought or left out.  In that respect, many would view this as a case of equality delayed being equality denied.  We do not want to see that happen.  The Minister and those who drafted the legislation may not have set out with that intention, but it has come to pass and that is how matters stand.<\/p>  <p>  We must always consider that all parents deserve the maximum amount of time with their children, particularly in their formative years.  As someone who has four children, I remember that the very early weeks and years of their lives were vital.  Those years are vital to parents, siblings and everyone else around the children.  Bonding happens at that very early stage.  Anything that can be done from a legislative point of view to ensure that we provide for parents to be there for their children and to get that bond in place as early as possible can pay huge dividends later in life as they go into their teenage years and early adulthood because that bond stays with them.  From a young age, children will always talk about their earliest memories.  It is usually something that happened with a parent, some intimate moment, a moment of joy or an expression of something that happened very early in the child's life.  Usually, in that moment, the parent was the one who was there.  I hope that in our modern society, when children look back to their earliest memories, they do not involve childminders or cr&egrave;ches.  That would be very unfortunate.  I understand that modern society brings with it huge pressures, that couples must both work to pay mortgages, to manage or to survive and that this means that sometimes in those formative years children are dropped off at 7 a.m. and not picked up until 8 p.m, and it is bedtime after that.  They find they do not have that sense of oneness with the family unit.  That is very unfortunate and, in light of it, I often wonder how much progress our society is actually making.  We are where we are, however.<\/p>  <p>  We will support the Bill.  A number of amendments will come up and we will look at them.  The issue of proper consultation with employers has been raised.  I have had some communications about that matter.<\/p><p>That said, the Bill must be focused on that so as to ensure the employee gets the maximum benefit from this legislation.<br\/><br\/>Naturally enough, employers will always say they need to be considered, as they do, but at the same time this Bill will deal with a very small fraction of the time a person will be in employment.  The vast majority of employers will be able to deal with it adequately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500037#KK00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571163600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their consideration and I acknowledge again the lacuna in the adoptive leave legislation.

The amendment would interrupt the build-up of contributions to the employee's pension scheme and would, as I understand it, serve to lessen to some extent the pension payable when a person retires.

I bring forward this amendment having been contacted by a number of bodies representing employers.  I do not for a minute want anybody to think we are not supportive of the Bill, as we are very much supportive of it, and it is very welcome that the motivation behind the legislation is to improve the work-life balance for parents.  It is a concept that we support.  However, in doing that we must be cognisant of having a fair balance.  We must achieve an improved work-life balance for parents while considering the need for sustainable employment and enhanced economic competitiveness.<\/p><p>I suppose it is unfortunate in a sense.  My understanding is that no regulatory impact assessment has been done on the effects of this legislation relating to creation and retention of jobs, in particular in respect of the amendment I am putting forward.<\/p> <p> This proposed amendment seeks to allow employers to offer employees returning from parent's leave alternative employment under a new contract of employment if it is not reasonably practical for the employer to permit the employee to return to his or her previous role.  The new employment offered must be suitable for the employee concerned.  Furthermore, the contract must not be on terms that are less favourable to the employee and must incorporate any improvement to the terms or conditions of employment to which the employee would have been entitled if he or she had not been on leave.  Continuity of service is maintained.  My understanding is that a similar provision exists in section 27 of the Maternity Protection Act 1994, section 19 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 and section 16 of the Parental Leave Act 1998, as amended.<\/p> <p> The point has been made that leave provided for under this Bill is only for a short period.  As such, the job of an employee should not be required to change in that period.  That would be correct in a sense if this was stand-alone legislation.  However, the leave will rise from two weeks to seven weeks over the coming three years up to 2021.  The period of leave is likely to be added on to the end of a longer period of leave.  For example, a person who takes maternity leave and then additional unpaid maternity leave of up to 42 weeks in total can then add the two weeks' paid parental leave to the end of that period.  During such a period there may have been significant changes in the workplace.  A client could have gone or a department may have changed.  If the woman returns following maternity leave, the employer would have this right.  However, because the two weeks of parental leave is attached to the end of that period, the employer no longer has that right.<\/p> <p> My views are stronger in respect of this amendment.  Standing alone, I can see where the Department and the Minister of State are coming from.  However, if joined up with other protected leave legislation and taken concurrently, then to my mind there is an anomaly.  I believe this amendment will rectify that anomaly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500038#LL01900","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571164200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>The proposed section 21 put forward by this amendment is taken from the Parental Leave Act 1998.  An equivalent provision is not included in the Adoptive Leave Act or the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act.  Instead, these Acts rely on provisions similar to section 20 of this Bill.  Section 20 gives the employee the right to return to the same job he or she held before going on leave.  Where that job was not the employee's usual job, he or she can return to the usual job or the job held immediately before leave was taken.  There would be a concern that if that was not the case and if people could not go back to the same jobs, they may not take the leave at all.  We are talking about parent's leave.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed section 21 would allow return to a different job subject to some safeguards.  I am of the opinion that parent's leave is more closely related to paternity, adoptive and maternity leave than to parental leave as provided for in the 1998 Act, which is where this proposal comes from.  The latter is unpaid and is taken over a longer period - up to when the child is 12 years of age - than the other forms of leave.  The kind of flexibility provided to the employer in this situation may be justified by this consideration.  I see it as inappropriate to apply the provision to parent's leave uniquely among the forms of leave taken at an earlier stage of the child's life.  Moreover, parent's leave is of a relatively short duration.  It cannot be more than nine weeks.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an error in the amendment.  One paragraph refers to \"while on parental leave\".  That is a different form of leave.  We are bringing in what we call \"parent's leave\".  This is the Parent's Leave and Benefits Bill and does not relate to parental leave, which is unpaid.  There is an error in the amendment which would make it unworkable and confusing in any event.<\/p>  <p>  I believe what is working well with maternity leave, adoptive leave and paternity leave as it stands is what we want to do here rather than make a change.  They are all of the same family or grouping.  In contrast, parental leave is unpaid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500039#MM00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1571164200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>There is some agreement in terms of what we are trying to achieve.  I apologise for the typographical error in the amendment.  Under the rules there is a facility to change that.  It should refer to \"parent's leave\" as opposed to \"parental leave\" because they derive from two different tranches of legislation.  I thank the Minister of State for pointing that out.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State alludes to the fact that the position he is taking is primarily because this leave is for a short period.  It is for two weeks now from 1 November up to a maximum of nine weeks in 2021.  I want to ensure that it is reflective of maternity leave.  This is because what will possibly happen is that people who are on maternity leave will take paid maternity leave and then, potentially, take unpaid parental leave and then this measure will run concurrently.  Really and truly, the person who is on leave could potentially be on some sort of leave, whether paid maternity leave, unpaid maternity leave or paid parent's leave, and out of work up to a period in excess of 42 weeks now, rising to 49 weeks in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  We should have the same principle enshrined in our legislation to protect the employee, but we should also acknowledge that there could be a change in circumstances during that 49-week period.

The advertisement basically advises employees to seek legal advice on the matter because their rights are being breached.  It would be highly ironic for this House to be advocating workers' rights on the one hand and on the other hand to be diminishing them.  We should reject this amendment outright.  It is not in the interests of workers.  it is in the interests of IBEC, which has stated as much.  We cannot be contradictory by claiming to advocate for workers' rights in terms of when they return to their jobs.  The jobs they were doing have to be kept for them.

I am very grateful to Members of both Houses for their speedy consideration of this legislation, which is very much part of the ongoing Brexit preparedness work of this Government.  I acknowledge the constructive engagement of Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties in Northern Ireland on the need for this legislation.  Members will be aware that we passed the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, also known as the Brexit omnibus Bill, in this House in April.  The purpose of that Bill, from a health perspective, was to deal with north, south, east and west reciprocal healthcare arrangements, but the Bill before us this evening goes above and beyond that.  This legislation represents the Government fulfilling its obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and adhering not just to the letter but to the spirit of that agreement in making sure that people from the North, when they holiday in the EU, outside of the Republic of Ireland, can access healthcare in emergency situations.  We are talking about situations where, for example, somebody goes to Spain on holiday and gets ill suddenly.  The Bill also contains provisions relating to British citizens accessing our childcare scheme.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is being introduced on my behalf, as Minister for Health, and on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, as it contains two sets of legislative provisions.  The health related aspect concerns the provision of similar benefits to those available under European health insurance card, EHIC, to eligible residents of Northern Ireland in the case of a no-deal Brexit.  The Bill also includes amendments to the Childcare Support Act 2018 to provide for British citizens to have access to the forthcoming national childcare scheme on the same basis as Irish citizens.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation has been identified as a clear priority in the context of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit.  As I said, I acknowledge and appreciate the co-operation of colleagues in this House who have facilitated the Bill for debate as a matter of priority.  The tight timeframe involved has, unfortunately, been necessary due to the pressing urgency for the legislation to be enacted before the end of the month, given that the Government continues to plan for a no-deal Brexit while obviously hoping for a better outcome.  In the context of planning for a possible no-deal Brexit, ensuring that the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are respected and upheld in all relevant policy areas is a very important issue upon which the Government is very engaged.  The Government continues to work with the UK to reinforce the message that the rights and entitlements of all those living in Northern Ireland are of fundamental importance and must be protected.  We are actively engaged in ensuring that people in Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy access to important EU rights, opportunities and benefits into the future, including the benefits of EHIC.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the EHIC scheme requires that the state that issues the card, in this case Ireland, meets the cost of any services accessed by the holder in another EU or EEA jurisdiction.  EU citizens can then visit another member state and, if required, avail of necessary public healthcare during a temporary visit there.  Therefore, the objective of this legislation is to ensure that if the UK leaves the EU without a withdrawal agreement, eligible residents in Northern Ireland will not be out of pocket if necessary health expenses are incurred while on a temporary stay in another EU or EEA member state or in Switzerland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Good Friday Agreement, all the people of Northern Ireland are recognised as having the birthright to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly the right to hold both Irish and British citizenship.  In view of the various adverse effects of a no-deal Brexit outcome on EU citizens resident in Northern Ireland, among which is the loss of access to the benefits of the EHIC scheme when travelling to other member states, and recalling the important role the EU plays in supporting the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is putting in place this measure in an effort to mitigate this loss to EU citizens, which includes Irish as well as British citizens.  The scheme will be based as far as possible on the current EHIC rules.  The applicant must not travel for the purpose of receiving planned healthcare, for example, and any co-payments that apply to residents of the country being visited will not be reimbursable.<\/p>  <p>  Under existing arrangements, EU citizens travelling to another member state who present an EHIC can generally access healthcare at a significantly reduced or no cost basis, which is of significant benefit for these patients.  Therefore, the immediate priority now for this House, given the limited timeframe to the end of October and the absolute imperative to have a scheme in place for 1 November 2019, is to devise and implement an approach that ensures, in the event of a no-deal scenario occurring, that eligible residents of Northern Ireland can have access to arrangements that allow them to be reimbursed for the cost of healthcare that may become necessary while on a temporary stay in an EU or EEA member state.<\/p><p>Under the scheme, patients will pay upfront at the point of delivery for their treatment and claim reimbursement directly from the HSE on their return home.  My Department has requested the HSE to design and build the ICT and administrative system and this is well under way.  In summary, the operational aspects underpinning the direct reimbursement scheme will include an online application portal, with the aim of providing a user-friendly, single-step reimbursement application process for eligible residents in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> As I stated in the Seanad, this is not a perfect model but it is, after significant engagement with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the European Commission, the best model we can put in place to give access to residents of Northern Ireland after 31 October in the case of a no-deal Brexit which will be as equivalent as possible to that available under the EHIC scheme.<\/p> <p> Part 3 proposes to amend the Childcare Support Act 2018 to make provision for British citizens to access the national childcare scheme, a scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of quality childcare, on the same basis as Irish citizens.  Once introduced, it will replace existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme providing both universal and targeted childcare subsidies.  An issue could arise for British citizens living in Northern Ireland who wish to access the scheme and register their children with childcare service providers in the State, and also for British citizens moving to the State to live.  In the event of an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, British citizens will be treated as nationals of EU member states for the period of transition.  However, in the event of no deal or in the longer term, the policy approach reflected in the Bill, consistent with the principles and intent of the common travel area, is to make provision for British citizens to access the national childcare scheme in the State on the same basis as Irish citizens.  The amendments in Part 3 put beyond doubt that British citizens will be eligible to apply for the national childcare scheme in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  As such, it offers assurance to British citizens living in Northern Ireland who wish to access the scheme and avail of childcare services in the State, as well as to British citizens moving to Ireland to live.<\/p> <p> I will now outline the various provisions of the Bill.  In Part 1, section 1 provides the Short Title of the Bill and provides for the commencement of the various Parts of the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 2 is a standard provision concerning the paying of expenses relating to the administration of the Bill.<\/p> <p> In Part 2, section 3 sets out the definitions required for Part 2 of the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 4 makes provision for the implementation of a scheme for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by eligible persons resident in Northern Ireland in respect of necessary medical treatment.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations to provide for administrative arrangements to give full effect to the provisions of Part 2.  It also outlines the principles and policies to which the Minister shall have regard when drafting the regulations.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides that the HSE, for the purposes of Part 2 of the Bill, may enter into arrangements with competent institutions in other member states. <\/p> <p> Section 7 provides that the HSE may have regard to the decisions of the administrative commission for the co-ordination of social security systems regarding the operation and administration of the European health insurance card scheme as operated under EU Regulation 883\/2004.<\/p> <p> Section 8 requires the HSE to carry out a review of the operation of the Act no later than two years after its commencement and the Minister must lay that review before the Oireachtas no later than one month after the report is received.<\/p> <p> In Part 3, section 9 provides for the definition of \"Principal Act\" for the purposes of Part 3 of the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 10 provides for an amendment to section 7 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 to make explicit reference to the eligibility of a British citizen to apply for financial support under the Act.<\/p> <p> Section 11 is a consequential amendment to section 15 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 to provide that payment will not be made where the person does not satisfy the eligibility criteria in section 7 of the 2018 Act.<\/p> <p> Statutory regulations will be required in respect of Part 2 in order to define as necessary the administrative arrangements for the direct reimbursement scheme.  Officials from my Department are progressing the drafting of these regulations in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. <\/p> <p> We have identified on a cross-party basis in both Houses of the Oireachtas this area as a clear priority and part of our contingency planning.  By looking to the rights of residents of Northern Ireland in accessing healthcare in EU member states other than Ireland, it goes above and beyond the aim of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act to simply ensure reciprocal rights continued North, South, east and west.  I know from speaking to communities in the North that the Bill will be warmly welcomed there.  I acknowledge that it is not a perfect fit.

We also want these rights to be reciprocated.  It is imperative that people born in the Republic retain full access to public services in the UK, including healthcare, on the same basis as currently pertains.  That is of great importance for the approximately 430,000 people living in the UK who were born in the Republic, but it must also apply to those visiting Northern Ireland or elsewhere in Britain.  Of course, the latter group is the target of the Bill and the European health insurance card.<\/p>  <p>  Although Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill, it would be remiss of me not to speak to the healthcare service in the Republic to which the Bill would provide access for residents of Northern Ireland.

The main service that would be accessed by people from Northern Ireland visiting the Republic would be emergency departments.  What do such prospective patients see as they look south of the Border?  They see 70 year olds, 80 year olds and 90 year olds waiting on chairs or trolleys for days.  They see levels of overcrowding not experienced in Northern Ireland or Britain and that have never been seen before in the South.

Tallaght Hospital has four such posts, one quarter of the number that would be enjoyed in Northern Ireland.  Of those four posts, two are currently being filled by locums.  Tallaght Hospital, which serves a significant swathe of Wicklow, Kildare and Dublin, has two full-time consultants in emergency medicine in post.

I want to be as constructive as I can in the few words I have to say on this matter.  As the Minister will be aware, I am proud to speak as a member of an all-island, 32-county party.  We have supported the Government's position on Brexit and related matters.  At every opportunity, we have given credit where it has been due.  For some time, Sinn F&eacute;in has called for a solution to be achieved between the Irish Government and the EU on the availability of the EHIC for people in the North.  We have been pushing for this continuously.  In fairness, this Bill is proof that the Government has been listening.  While it does not go as far as we would like, we recognise it as a step.<\/p><p>We welcomed the Government's announcement that it would be issuing EHICs to people in the North.  This decision was very much welcomed by people in the North, who are at the business end of this matter.  When the announcement about the EHICs was made, people across the North contacted Sinn F&eacute;in representatives across the Six Counties to get more details.  This is one of the benefits of Sinn F&eacute;in's status as a genuinely 32-county party.  In July of this year, the Government published a contingency action plan update, which gave the people of the North an express commitment that they would have access to the EHIC.  This was written confirmation of what had already been committed to by many Ministers in the previous year.  As the details became clear last Monday morning, like many others I was disappointed to learn that the Government had decided to proceed with a reimbursement scheme rather than an actual extension of the EHIC.  The Committee Stage amendments I have proposed would seek to rectify this.  Our disappointment was compounded by our knowledge that the Government had committed over recent weeks and months to extend the EHIC to people post Brexit.<\/p><p>We cannot fail to notice the ticking clock on RT&Eacute; as Brexit approaches.  We are all very focused on when this legislation may be needed.  Of course we hope it will not be required.  We need to be prepared.  Last week, the Minister told the Seanad:<\/p><blockquote>The initial point we would all have liked to arrive at was a point where one could effectively replicate the EHIC card.  For a variety of reasons, including extensive engagement with many different stakeholders, legal advice, the European Commission and, most crucially, the very short timeframe between now and a potential no-deal Brexit on 31 October, we took the decision to go with this version [rather than the extension of an actual EHIC] because we felt it was most important to have a workable scheme in place within that timeframe.<\/blockquote><p>It is hard to disagree with that logic.  I ask the Minister to outline the nature of the legal advice he has received.  What has the Commission said to entail the replacement of a like-for-like swap of EHICs by a new system that is underwritten by the State?  It is convenient to use Brexit as an excuse for everything.  Brexit has been going on for a while.  I appreciate that time is tight now, but time has not been tight for the past few years, when we had an opportunity to debate this matter.  Given that this has gone on for a while, it is a bit of a stretch to say that there is a tight timeframe.  We know there is pressure on us with regard to Brexit.  We have worked with the Government every step of the way to pass legislation to protect the citizens on this island.  It appears to me that the tight timeframe is of the Government's own making.<\/p><p>When the review of this legislation has been completed, I ask the Government to have a longer look at it, rather than being surprised when it runs out of time.  The benefits of the EHIC, as opposed to a reimbursement scheme, should be examined.  The card is a good scheme.  People know how beneficial it is.  It allows someone who is on a holiday or a short-term stay to access healthcare in another EU or EEA country without charge.  Most people who are travelling will say that having an EHIC gives them great peace of mind.  They know that if they need a doctor or if they have an emergency, their EHIC will be there to cover them.  The loss of this very important card has been a very serious worry for people in the North since the Brexit vote.  We can imagine how reassuring it was for them to get the commitment I have mentioned.  The change of direction that involves establishing a reimbursement scheme instead of giving EHICs to people in the North is disappointing.  I hope the Minister will explain this evening why they did not get what they were initially promised.  This situation is creating practical problems for people who might not be able to pay medical bills in the first instance.  It is simply a fact that there are people who might not have the means to pay such bills.  They could be left waiting.  They are very worried.<\/p><p>It is regrettable that the Government has not fully kept its word on this matter.  With that in mind, I have tabled amendments to rectify the problem.  My proposals would save the State the expense of a cumbersome reimbursement scheme, the operation of which will be more expensive than a like-for-like swap.<\/p><p>I have submitted two other amendments that pertain to the Childcare Support Act 2018.  This Bill provides for British citizens to be able to access the national childcare scheme on the same basis as Irish citizens.  This subject is in the news at the moment.  It is a very current subject.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell me whether the insertion of the phrase &quot;British citizen&quot; immediately presupposes that Irish citizens in the North are British citizens to be assessed in that manner after Brexit.  Perhaps the Minister will use his time at the end of Second Stage to explain that.  I believe the Bill could differentiate between British citizens, Irish citizens ordinarily resident in the North and British citizens ordinarily resident in the North.  The Constitution tells us, &quot;It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland .... to be part of the Irish Nation&quot;, and to identify as Irish.  In light of the recent DeSouza judgment, it would be very helpful if this could be clarified on behalf of the Government.  The authorities across the water are trying to deny that Irish people in the North are Irish.  For the avoidance of any doubt, they are as Irish as me or the Minister.  It is nonsense to suggest otherwise.  We certainly will not stand for it.  Neither the Minister and the Government should stand for it.<\/p><p>I will conclude by calling again for some clarity.  I repeat that we should schedule some time for a debate on what Fianna F&aacute;il failed to get in the budget negotiations.  I would very much enjoy such a debate.  I would play my part in it.  However, we are here to discuss the Health and Childcare Support (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500042#PP00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1571166000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I support Deputy O'Reilly's important proposals.  The Minister has told the House that, \"Under the Good Friday Agreement, all the people of Northern Ireland are recognised as having the birthright to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\".  Accordingly, the right to hold both Irish and British citizenship extends to them.  Given the currency of this matter, it is quite disgraceful that the Taoiseach spoke about it in such a dismissive tone this afternoon.  The DeSouza judgment flies in the face of every piece of legislation of this nature that we try to put through the House.  Regardless of whether Brexit is accompanied by a deal, we are in big trouble if we do not have an understanding that the Good Friday Agreement remains intact and all of its provisions apply to the people of Northern Ireland almost as if they were sacred.  I do not think the people of this country appreciated the sarcastic and dismissive tone that was used by the Taoiseach this afternoon when this issue was raised on Leaders' Questions.  The good news is that Ms DeSouza has announced in the last few hours that she intends to continue her legal battle.  Rather than criticising people for making demands or insisting that this issue be dealt with, the Government and the Minister for Health should welcome Ms DeSouza's decision.  If it does nothing else, it will back up the Government's attempt to legislate for the equal rights of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500042#PP00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1571166600,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be able to speak on the Health and Childcare Support (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.

I welcome that.  I never mention the agreement without mentioning a former Deputy, Minister of State and Senator, Professor Martin Mansergh, as well as Father Alec Reid, two Tipperary men who worked hard with former Taoisigh Bertie Ahern and Albert Reynolds.  Father Reid, Martin McGuinness and many others have gone to their eternal reward.  It was a milestone agreement and we will do anything we can do to support it.

He understands the situation.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we maintain continuity where  possible.  The Bill seeks to achieve that.  I am worried about some of the legislation because so much of it is going through the House very quickly.  These Bills are being rushed; time is not on our side.  Legal scrutiny and everything else is sparse.  We need to be cautious.  <\/p>  <p>  Irrespective of that, I welcome the provision on the eligibility of certain British citizens to apply for financial support under the affordable childcare scheme proposed as part of the Government's commitment to maintain the common travel area, CTA, and its associated rights and privileges.

We cannot look after our own.  I understand 570 people are on trolleys today.  The issue has become sanitised.  As Professor Paul O'Regan said, trolleys are fine but because of where they are placed there is a lack of services around them.  There are no electrical points for blood transfusions and so on.  South Tipperary General Hospital often does not have blankets, pillows or sheets for people on trolleys.  There is no proper access to any services.  <\/p>  <p>  I have said before and will say again now that the Minister, the head of the HSE and other top people should be brought to The Hague and charged with the crime of sleep deprivation.

The hospital in Tipperary is old.  CUH and hospitals in Dublin were built a reasonably short time ago, in the past 40 or 50 years.  They have wide corridors, unlike the old type of corridors in the hospital in Tipperary where if a person is attending to someone on a trolley, nobody can pass with another trolley or anything else.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, the CTA enables Irish and British citizens to access a range of similar rights on a reciprocal basis, including access to healthcare and education in the other country.  It is vital that we do everything we can to sustain that arrangement.  I will not oppose the Bill for that reason.  As I said, I have major issues.  Irish and British citizens can access a range of similar rights.  There are issues in the National Health Service, NHS, in Great Britain, but nothing would surpass what we have in terms of the sheer mismanagement and bungling.  Front-line staff in all hospitals, including those in regional hospitals, work tirelessly and painstakingly but they cannot cope.  They are leaving because of stress.  When people in Tipperary have a psychotic episode they have to go into the mad accident and emergency department - I use the term \"mad\" because of the lack of organisation and the chronic waiting times - and wait up to 20 hours to be seen.

It is vital that the Government navigates its way through uncertain times with our heads well screwed on so that important agreements are held in place and continue well into the future.  It is important that we work together and listen to the concerns of the people.<\/p>  <p>  We need to address the extremely long waiting periods for assessment on our own doorstep faced by children with autism and Asperger's syndrome.  The Disability Act 2005 provides that children be assessed within short timeframes so that tailored treatment can be identified, but the HSE has consistently failed to comply with this, forcing many to take the private route.  People who are unable to take this option must join a waiting list of 18 months and upwards.  Once a child is finally assessed, the struggle to find a school place begins.  I heard that around 100 parents in Cork attended an open evening last week in the hope of securing a place for a special needs child only to be told that there was one place available for next September.  This is not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at the simple grommets procedure, children are waiting for years for an appointment during which time they might develop speech delay, which in turn means that they will need speech therapy.  This is a classic example of how the Government keeps kicking the can down the road.  Why can it not see that if we treat the condition when it arises, it will save time and money in the long run?  Parents see this and are taking their children to private hospitals in Northern Ireland.  People are travelling to Northern Ireland for a simple tonsillectomy because children are suffering in pain.  Why can this not be done in a reasonable time in Bantry General Hospital or in Cork?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500044#RR00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1571167200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to conclude, particularly since the Minister for Health introduced the Bill on his and my own behalf.  I will discuss the aspect of this Bill relating to the national childcare scheme along with another issue raised during Second Stage.  I will launch the national childcare scheme in a few weeks.  It is our pathway to accessible, affordable and quality childcare in Ireland.  It is a scheme of financial support for parents towards the cost of quality childcare.  Once introduced, it will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme providing both universal and income related subsidies.  By tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare, the scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support employment and lifelong learning, reduce child poverty and support gender equality.  The launch of the national childcare scheme will be a landmark.  It creates the first ever statutory entitlement to childcare support in the State.<\/p>  <p>  Through this Bill, we will copper-fasten the statutory entitlements for British citizens.  We will ensure they can access the scheme on the same basis as Irish citizens and that the principles and intent of the common travel area are reflected in the legislative framework for the national childcare scheme.  Part 3 of this Bill proposes to amend the Childcare Support Act 2018 to make provision for British citizens to access the national childcare scheme on the same basis as Irish citizens.<\/p>  <p>  To address directly something raised by Deputy O'Reilly, the term \"British citizen\" does not presuppose that all those in Northern Ireland are British citizens.  Irish citizens are already covered by reference to EU citizens in the Act.  This covers both Irish citizens in the State and Northern Ireland.  In drafting the Bill, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was satisfied on this point.  In the event of an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, British citizens will be treated as nationals of EU member states for the period of transition.  However, in the event of no deal or in the longer term, the policy approach reflected in this Bill, consistent with the principles and intent of the common travel area, is to make provision for British citizens to access the national childcare scheme in the State on the same basis as Irish citizens.  The amendments in Part 3 put beyond doubt that British citizens will be eligible to apply for the national childcare scheme in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  As such, it offers assurance to British citizens living in Northern Ireland who wish to access the scheme and avail of childcare services in the State as well as British citizens moving to Ireland to live.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Deputy O'Reilly has tabled amendments to Part 3 of the Bill that propose to add references in sections 7 and 15 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 to include Irish citizens who are ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland and British citizens who are ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland.  However, section 7 of the Childcare Support Act sets out the persons who are eligible to apply for financial support under the national childcare scheme.  Section 7(1)(b)(iv) provides that persons who are nationals of a member state of the European Union are eligible to apply for financial support under the scheme.  Irish citizens ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland are, therefore, already covered in section 7.  There is no need to refer specifically to Irish citizens ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland as they will continue to be nationals of an EU member state after Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  British citizens who are ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland are captured by the amendment proposed at section 10 of the Bill.  This is because British citizens regardless of their ordinary residence will be eligible to apply for the scheme.  There is, therefore, no need to refer specifically in section 7 to British citizens ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the consequential amendments proposed to section 15 of the Childcare Support Act 2018 are unnecessary as Irish citizens ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland are already captured under section 7(1)(b)(iv), while British citizens ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland will be captured by the amendment proposed at section 10 of the Bill.  As such, the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Reilly are unnecessary, but I thank her for the opportunity to clarify these important matters and I hope this explanation provides reassurance with regard to the eligibility of persons living in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill demonstrates the Government's continued commitment to contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit and to ensuring that the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the principles and intent of the common travel area are respected and upheld in all relevant policy areas.  I acknowledge and appreciate the co-operation of colleagues in the House, who facilitated the Bill for debate as a matter of priority.  The tight timeframe has been necessary, unfortunately, due to the pressing need for the legislation to be enacted by the end of the month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500044#RR00400","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571167200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health and Childcare Support (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019 [Seanad]: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1571167200,"counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500044#RR00550"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571167200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571167200,"counter":507,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571167200,"counter":508,"content":"<p>Amendments No. 1 to 4, inclusive, may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500044#RR00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1571167200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Issuance of European Health Insurance Card to eligible persons<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>4.<\/b>(1) An eligible person shall be entitled to a European Health Insurance Card to be issued by the Executive.<br \/><br \/>(2) An application for a European Health Insurance Card by an eligible person under <i>subsection (1)<\/i>shall be made in the prescribed form and manner at HSE Local Health Offices or through the HSE managed website.<br \/><br \/>(3) On receipt of an application under <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, the Executive shall issue a European Health Insurance Card to the eligible person, or the person acting on their behalf, in the prescribed form and manner, where it is satisfied that&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the person in respect of whom the application is made is an eligible person, and<br \/><br \/>(b) he or she, or a person acting on his or her behalf, has complied with this section and any regulations made under <i>section 5<\/i>.&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I have already outlined the reasons I have proposed these amendments.

This is a unilateral decision Ireland is taking, not a bilateral arrangement with the UK Government.  We as a State are making this decision to fulfil what we believe are our responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement.  Irish taxpayers will meet the reimbursement costs and there is no role for the Northern Ireland Office, the UK or anyone else in that regard.  We all agree this is the right and proper thing to do under the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the operation of the scheme.  We have instructed the HSE to provide for a robust online portal system that will require some verifications from the applicant.  It will validate the applicant's eligibility status, through provision of proof of residence, for example.  It will also require validation of reimbursement claims, such as a copies of receipts, and the completion of a self-declaration form, which confirms that the health benefits being reimbursed meet the terms of the scheme.  As I stated on Second Stage, one cannot go to France for an operation in a planned manner.  This provision is only for people who get sick while on a temporary visit abroad.  That is how EHICs have always worked.  The primary legislation will not deal with the operational scheme.  Instead, statutory regulations will set out the form and manner in which the HSE will reimburse applicants, as well as the detailed design of the scheme.  I expect to sign these regulations in the coming weeks, before 31 October.  We will operate the scheme through an online portal in as easy a manner as possible while putting safeguards in place.  I am happy to keep the House updated as the regulations progress.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the good faith in which Deputy O'Reilly's amendments were tabled.  In an ideal world, not only would I be accepting these amendments, but they would be in the substance of the Bill we brought forward.  The effect of the Deputy's amendments is to delete references to the direct reimbursement scheme, which is the core purpose of the legislation before the House, and replace them with an explicit obligation on the Minister for Health to issue EHICs to eligible persons resident in Northern Ireland.  That is what we set out to do, and while it seems a simple proposal on the face of it, I assure the Deputy that it is far from straightforward.  The Deputy has rightly asked me, on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland, to explain why that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  The legal basis for issuing EHICs is provided by EU Regulation No. 883\/2004.  It was not debated much during Second Stage but that is the European Parliament regulation on which EHICs hang.  We all know how they work, so I do not need to go through that again.  Our preferred approach to this objective was to extend cover to the target cohort, that is, people resident in Northern Ireland, under that regulation.  This approach, if deemed feasible, would have allowed the HSE to issue EHICs to eligible residents in Northern Ireland almost identically to how it does currently.  However, that regulation is very detailed.  It supports the free movement of people by protecting the social security entitlements of EEA nationals who exercise their right to free movement within the EEA, ensuring that entitlements are not diminished as people move within that area.  Its core purpose is to provide for the co-ordination of pensions and unemployment benefits.  As such, it has a much broader scope than the sole benefit of EHICs, and there could be unintended consequences to extending it.<\/p>  <p>  Once the Government decided to proceed with this objective, officials in my Department carried out detailed work over the summer months in consultation with other key Departments, principally the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of the Attorney General.  They assessed whether it was possible to extend the EHIC entitlement to the target cohort only by utilising the discrete healthcare provision of EU Regulation No. 883\/2004.  We also held informal and formal engagements with the European Commission, as it is responsible for oversight of and technical guidance on the implementation of governing legislation.  A subsequent meeting took place in July with representatives of the European Commission and all relevant key stakeholder Departments, at which they explored the possibility of using that regulation to extend EHIC benefits in more detail.  Following the formal engagement, Ireland was advised by the Commission that using the existing legal basis set out in EU Regulation No. 883\/2004 to extend EHIC cover is not feasible.  We therefore had to look for an alternative,  which is this Bill.  This is absolutely not the perfect way to achieve this goal.  However, it is the best way to do it by 31 October.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the fact that a review clause is built into the legislation.  That is to be welcomed.  However, what we would all welcome even more is never needing to commence this legislation.  We continue to hope for a planned Brexit rather than a no-deal Brexit.  This legislation only comes into effect in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  If a Brexit deal is reached, there will then be a transition period, during which people in Northern Ireland will continue to be treated as EU citizens.  That will allow us two years or so to tease through all these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500045#SS00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1571167800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>I seek clarification on two issues.

Will the Minister walk us through an example of the scheme's operation?  Let us take someone from Belfast who is on holiday in France, for instance.

That person must then log on to the HSE online portal and fill out the self-declaration form stating that he or she became unexpectedly sick while on holiday in France, went to the emergency department, and what the cost was.  He or she must also submit the receipt and proof that he or she is a resident of Northern Ireland.  The HSE will then reimburse the cost within weeks.

I want to express my gratitude and that of the Government for this work.<\/p>  <p>  The opportunity cost of all this is significant.  We have teams of civil servants in all Departments who would much rather be working on issues we would rather they were working on.  Obviously, it is right and proper that Brexit preparedness are priorities Nos.1, 2 and 3.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge both Paul Flanagan and Tom Monks and their team from my Department, as well as Laura McGarrigle from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and her team.  On a broader basis, on behalf of every Member, I want to acknowledge the absolute dedication of the Civil Service at a difficult time.

This group of workers are often overlooked when it comes to State support.  They are certainly underpaid for the hard work they do every day.  This group includes the preschool teachers who are so vital to our children's education; the waiters who serve one food in one&rsquo;s favourite restaurant; the baristas who get up early in the morning to prepare coffee for other commuters; and the cashiers who sell one bread and milk at five-to-closing time on a Sunday night for one&rsquo;s lunch the next day.  All these people work hard and deserve to get paid fairly for it.<\/p><p>Incredibly, last week, the Fine Gael Government, and its friends, Fianna F&aacute;il, presented a budget that did absolutely nothing for these workers.  To not even include an increase in the minimum wage was a slap in the face to the 137,000 workers earning the minimum wage who work hard day in, day out.  Our motion calls on the Government to immediately reverse this decision and to introduce a living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour next year.<\/p><p>The minimum wage is simply too low and workers are struggling to get by on it.  Workers have waited long enough for proper pay and conditions.  We want to see a living wage - a rate of pay which would allow workers to pay for the basic necessities of life, to live with dignity and to participate fully as active citizens in our society.  That is not too much to ask.<\/p><p>I suspect I will hear the Minister attempt to blame Brexit or the Low Pay Commission for the Government's decision not to increase the minimum wage.  We will not be buying that nonsense.  Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, herself a member of the Low Pay Commission, said, &quot;The no-deal Brexit caveat contained in the Low Pay Commission report makes absolutely no reference whatsoever to a possible deferral of the recommended increase in the event of a no-deal Brexit.&quot;  In short, there has not been a no-deal Brexit and the attempt to blame Brexit or the Low Pay Commission for the Government's heartless decision simply will not wash with people.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are out of touch when even the Tories in London who are supporting a living wage.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has made its position crystal clear on the living wage.  We want it.  When we are in government, we will introduce it.  I have no doubt some Members tonight will say a living wage cannot be introduced because it will result in business closures and job losses.  Again, this is simply not true.<\/p><p>In our plan for introducing a living wage, Sinn F&eacute;in has set out how it would include legal protections for businesses which genuinely could not afford to pay the living wage.  If a business can open its books for inspection at the Labour Court and prove it cannot afford to introduce a living wage without it resulting in job losses or cuts in hours, then it could be granted an exemption.  It would then revert back to its normal pay with the minimum wage remaining the absolute floor.  This would ensure those businesses which may have small profit margins are able to stay in business and continue to employ the workers they have.<\/p><p>It would also ensure that those profitable businesses which can pay their workers a living wage do so.  Instead of assuming all businesses cannot pay the living wage, we will assume all businesses can pay it and grant exemptions to those which can prove otherwise.<\/p> <p> The Minister and her party have got this wrong.  They should not have shelved an increase in the minimum wage and tried to blame it on Brexit.  The Government has insulted thousands of workers in the process and its decision will make their lives more difficult.  There has been huge stress since the non-announcement by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, on budget day and the following day, respectively.  I hope the Government recognises this mistake and reverses its bad decision.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is proud to stand for ordinary hard-working people.  Sinn F&eacute;in is the party of the living wage and in government, we will deliver a living wage for workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500046#TT02700","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571169000,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to this motion at a time when workers in Ireland have never needed a living wage more and yet the Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il - whose Members are noticeable in their absence - response to this reality is to say \"No\" to an increase in the minimum wage and \"No\" to a living wage for these workers.<\/p>  <p>  Only two weeks ago, our absent Fianna F&aacute;il friends brought childcare workers - early years educators - into the audiovisual room to outline the many reasons these professionals in the childcare sector need a living wage.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not secure an increase in the minimum wage for these workers, let alone a living wage.  Not for the first time, Fianna F&aacute;il has failed to deliver for workers.  It is, of course, the party that cut the minimum wage when workers in this State were on their knees.  Now, even in a time of supposed economic growth, Fianna F&aacute;il is failing workers again.<\/p>  <p>  In response to this motion, the Government will tell us, as it has done previously, that Ireland has the second highest minimum wage in Europe.  That is a fact but what about the fact that Ireland has the highest childcare costs in Europe?  Dublin is now the fifth most expensive city in which to rent in Europe.  Drivers and householders pay some of the highest insurance premiums anywhere in Europe.  Ireland is the most expensive country out of the 28 nations in the EU in which to run a household.  In fact, a EUROSTAT report released in June shows that the cost of living in Ireland and paying for household costs such as rent, water, gas, electricity and maintenance is almost 57% higher than the EU average.  When one puts all of that together, the minimum wage being the second highest in Europe means nothing.<\/p>  <p>  Last year in its poverty focus report, Social Justice Ireland found that more than 100,000 people with jobs live in poverty.  There is something wrong when being in employment condemns a person to live in poverty.  Of course, these are the people who get up early.  The Taoiseach likes to tell citizens on a regular basis to get up, get out to work and it will lead to a better lifestyle but these people are living in poverty.  In a way, the Government facilitates this because as of last month, there were 52,074 people in receipt of the working family payment.  The Government spent an estimated &euro;430 million in 2018 in topping up poor wages to try to prevent in-work poverty.  If these workers were receiving the living wage, this wage top-up from the State would no longer be required.  Instead of supplementing poor wages for workers, the Government should be dealing with the issue, that is, the inadequacy of the minimum wage, which does not protect those who get up early in the morning and go out to work.<\/p>  <p>  This feeds into the already worrying attitude of the Government when it comes to workers in this State.  It does not want to give them a measly 30 cent increase in the minimum wage.  That was outlined quite clearly by the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, last week although it has been contradicted this afternoon by the Taoiseach, who completely undermined the Minister's position and contradicted the Government amendment to this motion.  While the Taoiseach has stated it will be rolled out in January, the Minister's amendment states no clear timeline whatsoever.  The Government is all over the place on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister does not want to pay these people a living wage.  The Minister does not want to give them a legal entitlement to the tips that they earn.  When it comes to recouping money owed to the State, the Minister chooses to go after those who rely on social welfare supports - older people, people with a disability and jobseekers - rather than big business, which uses bogus self-employment tactics to avoid paying PRSI.  That is what Fine Gael offers workers.<\/p>  <p>  I am proud to be part of a political party that not only represents workers, but in government will pay them a living wage, something that they thoroughly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500047#UU00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1571169000,"counter":550,"content":"<p>The Government's decision not to increase the national minimum wage in budget 2020 was a slap in the face to the 137,000 workers who currently earn the minimum wage.

While we have a responsibility in this Chamber, we are also people - not all of us because some of us did not take it - who received three pay increases in the past two years.  Let us imagine that for a second.  Deputies had three pay increases in the past two years.

That is extraordinary.<\/p>  <p>  People outside this House look at politics at times and the fairness of decisions a Government will make.  How is it fair to tell the lowest income workers in the State that they must wait?  Many people in this State earn a great deal of money.

The Government said, \"No\", to that but it has no problem whatsoever saying to those on a minimum wage that they must wait.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly talked about what the living wage is, and she is right.  The living wage is designed and calculated to work out what an individual needs to pay for their basic needs after a week's work.  It is not two holidays a year, or even one holiday.  It is not that they would have a comfortable lifestyle at the end of it.  It is that they would have enough money to pay for the lighting in their homes, food, medicines and the basic essentials.  That is what the living wage does yet the Government is not minded to support it, nor is Fianna F&aacute;il, which, on many other issues, speaks from both sides of its mouth.  The business lobby will come in.  Fianna F&aacute;il will fall into line.

It is based on research identifying the income required for the minimum essential standard of living for a single-adult household in Ireland, conducted by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice.<\/p><p>It is important that Ireland's statutory national minimum wage and the living wage concept are not conflated or mixed up.  The living wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  As a voluntary initiative, the living wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlements to anybody.<\/p><p>The national minimum wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers.  The national minimum wage is a legally-binding lowest average hourly rate that can be paid by an employer to an employee.  The rate is set and governed by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, which applies to all employees, including full-time, part-time, temporary and casual workers, with some minor exceptions.<\/p><p>When we add to the minimum wage the other social transfers available in the State that are paid to lower-paid workers, whether it is family income support, FIS, back to school allowances, fuel allowances, dependant child allowances and others, the amount provided to those many in need would meet, if not exceed, the living wage as suggested by the commission.  <\/p><p>It is important to highlight that since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the Government has accepted all of the recommendations it has made on the national minimum wage.  Since 2015, therefore, the national minimum wage has increased by 13.3%.  The most recent figures published by EUROSTAT for January 2019 show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU, currently at &euro;1,656 per month, second only to Luxembourg, at &euro;2,071 per month.<\/p><p> The national minimum wage approach seeks to find a balance between a fair and sustainable rate for low paid workers that will not have significant negative consequences for employers and competitiveness.  It can be seen as an evidence-based approach providing a clearly defined minimum hourly rate for employers, giving them the freedom to pay higher rates while concurrently providing a measure of security for low-paid workers.  As it is legally enforceable, it provides protection for those workers.<\/p> <p> It can be seen as a pragmatic approach providing a clearly defined minimum hourly rate for employers, and giving them the freedom to pay higher rates, while also providing security for low-paid workers.  More broadly, the setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and the Government does not interfere unduly in the process, provided that the national minimum wage is respected and adhered to.<\/p> <p>Widespread evidence demonstrates that the minimum wage is a blunt tool for reducing poverty, as many minimum wage earners are located in households higher in the income distribution range.  This was found in the recent ESRI report on the impact of the minimum wage on household income distribution.  The ESRI found that the national minimum wage has reduced wage inequality but it has done little to impact on the distribution of household incomes.  It explained this is because minimum wage workers are often located in households at the higher end of the income distribution range and are typically not primary earners within households.  <\/p> <p> It is essential, therefore, that other in-work supports are in place for low income families.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a number of in-work supports for low income families.  The working family payment provides support for employees with families who have low earnings relating to their family size.  It is currently paid to more than 54,000 families in respect of some 122,000 children. The average weekly payment made to families is estimated at &euro;135 per week.<\/p> <p> In budget 2020, the thresholds for the working family payment were increased by &euro;10 for one to three-child families.  The back to work family dividend is another in-work support. That scheme aims to help families move from social welfare into full-time sustainable employment.  This helps to increase the incomes of families on low incomes.  For example, for a two-child family, the working family payment increases after tax income by more than &euro;137 per week, and this will increase to more than &euro;147 under budget 2020 in January once we pass the social welfare Bill.<\/p> <p> Another important in-work support for low income families delivered by my Department is the income disregard on the lone parent-related payments.  The effect of this will be to increase the amount a lone parent will receive from employment without it reducing their social welfare payment.  This enhances the incentive for a lone parent to take up employment.  In budget 2020, for the third year in a row, the income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment increased by &euro;15 to &euro;165 per week.  Building on the foundations of developments in these schemes that we have made in recent years, I will continue to provide for a better deal for families, particularly those on low and fixed incomes.<\/p> <p> However, it is worth emphasising firmly that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission in their entirety and that the minimum wage will be increased by 30 cent to &euro;10.10, as announced in budget 2020.  It is important that people wishing to speak on the matter pay full attention to the Low Pay Commission's report and what it had to say.  The commission made its recommendations on the basis of an orderly Brexit and acknowledged that the Government may wish to review this recommendation in the event of a disorderly Brexit.  Given that the terms of Brexit are not yet finalised, all the Government decided to do last week was to defer the date of the implementation of the commission's recommendation, which it has accepted, and that decision will be made on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and once that becomes clear.  The increase is accepted but the timing at which it will commence has yet to be determined.  There is a long way to go between now and 1 January, which is the normal date that it would commence. <\/p> <p> The Government supports entirely an approach to the minimum wage that seeks to find a balance between fair and sustainable rate for low paid workers and one that will not have significant negative consequences for employers and competitiveness.  It is the job of Government to find the balance between those two competing elements.  The Government wishes to continue its approach of setting the national minimum wage through the Low Pay Commission structure.  This ensures that the relevant social partners are involved in an evidence-based approach of incrementally increasing the rate.  <\/p> <p> The aim of the Low Pay Commission is to recommend a national minimum wage that provides an incentive to work.  It is set at a rate that is both fair and sustainable and helps as many people as possible, without significantly adversely affecting competitiveness or having a significant negative effect on employment.  <\/p> <p> I remind Members that the Government committed in the programme for Government to incrementally increase the rate of the minimum wage to &euro;10.50.  We have raised it during the past number of years by 13.5% and when this recommendation is implemented, it will nearly be at our stated goal.  We are the party that is committed to steadily increasing the minimum wage.  I make no excuse for showing some prudence and caution.

The Low Pay Commission was established to depoliticise the issue.

If the Minister and the Government were to accept Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill, we could force a reduction in variable interest rates, something the Government has restricted and failed to adopt.<\/p>  <p>  Some 10,000 people have become homeless during the time this Government has been in office.  I was dealing with the case of a man who phoned me from Kinnegad.  He is working and has a family but because he is working and in receipt of the working family payment, he is above the income threshold for social housing.  He is not getting any assistance through the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  He is not entitled to avail of a Rebuilding Ireland mortgage because he was in a previous relationship and had a previous home.  We have yet to see the roll-out of the affordable housing scheme, despite it having been committed to not in the budget announced 12 months ago, as opposed to last week's.  Not one affordable housing scheme has been rolled out anywhere on this island.  We were promised a review of the social housing income limits for people who could avail of social housing and go on the social housing lists.  I have repeatedly tabled parliamentary questions on this to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and have been repeatedly told the review is imminent but we have yet to see it.<\/p><p> On childcare, one reason that is preventing so many people from taking up work is that, on average, 27.4% of an Irish person's income is spent on childcare compared to the OECD average of 12.6%.  If we are serious about helping families, what the Government should be doing is clearly outlining when it will introduce the increase to the minimum wage and what it is doing to tackle the exorbitant cost of living in this country.<\/p> <p> I want to turn to the area of business competitiveness.  We must be cognisant of the fact that when a minimum wage is increased or, as Sinn F&eacute;in is advocating in this instance, a living wage of &euro;12.30 is introduced, it is not the State but the many small and medium-sized businesses which will have to pick up those costs.  It is very hard to force small and medium businesses to pick up the cost of a living wage at a time when the State itself does not ensure that all its employees are in receipt of a living wage.  I am thinking of members of the Defence Forces, many of whom are not in receipt of a living wage.<\/p> <p> The most recent AIB Brexit sentiment survey from the third quarter of 2019 stated that more than four of every ten Irish firms believe that Brexit is already negatively impacting on business.  There has been a total erosion of confidence, which is having a serious effect on business.  If we are to have a hard Brexit, and we do not know what type of Brexit we are going to have, there is the potential for an unemployment rise to 5.8% in 2020, to 6.9% in 2021 and by a further 2.2% in 2022.<\/p> <p> What we should do is refer the living wage to the Low Pay Commission.  To be fair, the Low Pay Commission has depoliticised the area of the minimum wage and, in my opinion, it is best equipped to decide what is the best living wage.  We have to look at how a living wage would impact on small and medium enterprises.  Sinn F&eacute;in talks about ensuring that people have this living wage but if we put some of our SMEs out of business, instead of increasing people's income, we will decimate their income.  There are businesses that have huge challenges.  For example, the retail sector is on its knees in terms of the erosion of confidence and the competition from online trade, and, quite simply, it is only paying what it can afford to pay. <\/p> <p> If we want to understand the cost of doing business in this country, we need only look at commercial rates or the cost of borrowing, which for SMEs in this country is 65% higher than for European counterparts.  In January 2019, the cost of borrowing for SMEs in this country was on average 5.7% whereas EA1 and EA2 countries had a cost of borrowing for SMEs of just 2.5%.  Rental prices continue to rise, energy prices are higher than anywhere else in the EU and there is a tsunami of public liability insurance costs for SMEs and many are facing potential ruin because they are not able to pay their public liability insurance.  I raised this issue last week with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I cited the example of a constituent who is employing 31 people and, in the last 12 months, his public liability insurance has risen from just below &euro;40,000 to &euro;109,000 per year.  He is genuinely considering whether it is worthwhile keeping his door open.  That is 31 jobs.<\/p> <p> While there are many elements of the motion which we support, we have put forward amendments.  We believe the living wage should be referred to Low Pay Commission and that the Minister needs to accelerate her efforts to tackle the high cost of living and the high cost of doing business in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500049#WW00900","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571170800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I would like to build on the case made by Deputy Troy.  There are many ways of helping people and the reality is there is no point in getting the money in if people are paying out an inordinate amount of money unnecessarily.  The reality is that the cost of living in this country has gone through the ceiling, particularly for those at the bottom of the scale, that is, those on lower incomes.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at housing, rents are totally out of control.  Given the system operated under HAP, once people go over a certain level, they can run into trouble.  They cannot get on the HAP scheme because at &euro;25,000 or &euro;26,000, in certain cases, they are just not eligible, whereas, on the other hand, they cannot afford to buy a house because nobody will lend them the money.  The Government has made a total mess of housing, in particular for those who depend on public housing or would be clients for affordable housing, if any such thing existed in the State. <\/p>  <p>  The second big problem families face is the inordinate cost of childcare, which must be tackled.  If people are earning &euro;150,000 a year, they will complain if they have to pay large sums of money for childcare but they have the means to do it.  However, for people on the minimum wage or even just above that, it becomes doubtful whether it is worth their while working because most of their income is going to keep the children in childcare.<\/p>  <p>  We then look at the cost of car insurance, which has gone through the ceiling.  Many people have no option but to use a car, particularly when they have children.  Whether they are in urban or rural Ireland, that is a reality.  Many households, if they have two jobs, require two cars and this is particularly so in those parts of the country where the Government refuses to provide public transport.  Again, this is eating up a disproportionate amount of people's income.<\/p>  <p>  We then have the tax code.  There was a policy to progressively reduce USC, which was brought in as an emergency measure in emergency times.  Moreover, the basic tax credits have been left the same since 2010 or before that.  Of course, this means that, at a lower and lower income compared to the norm in society, people face paying tax, and the USC starts once a person's income is over &euro;12,000 a year.<\/p>  <p>  These are all measures the Government could tackle without putting up the cost to the employer.  Deputy Troy made a good case about the challenges facing small employers if we start putting up their costs, given all the other costs they face, such as insurance costs.  The other way of doing it, of course, is to make a more equal society.  There are people who say it is not worth their while working because the cost of childcare is eating up everything and because they have to travel 20 or 30 miles to work.  There are those coming into this city who cannot use public transport for one reason or another, and they find the day is inordinately long because they leave their children into a cr&egrave;che very early in the morning and collect them in the evening, and there are proportionate costs associated with that.<\/p><p>When the Minister looks at the statistics in her own Department, and if she does not know where to find them I will tell her someday, she will find that many people on low incomes tend to leave work because it just does not pay once they have to pay for childcare.  They then find that a one-income family on the same income pays a lot more tax than a two-income family if USC is counted as tax as well as PAYE.  That is the reality, and the difference between the two salaries added together and one person earning that is quite enormous.  One-earner families are therefore totally discriminated against.<br\/><br\/>There are many things the Minister can do.  The <i>status quo<\/i>is not acceptable.  I know where Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to go.  I do not agree with it because it does not solve the problem.  The main problem families in this country face is the cost base of living.  Providing more income while still allowing the cost base to spiral for very basic things we all need does not solve the problem; it just moves the goalposts back to where they were initially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500050#XX00200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571171400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>The first thing I will do - it may have been done already - is acknowledge the really valuable contribution workers in this country make to the economy.  More than 1 million people are employed in the micro and small business sector, as the Minister will know well.  That sector is probably one of the most successful anywhere in the world because of the commitment of workers.  Many people who have small businesses with eight, ten, 12, 15 or 20 people working for them will say the co-operation and people often going beyond the call of employment duty are what leads to the success of those businesses.  They are a huge factor in the success of the regions.<\/p>  <p>  I think my colleagues have already outlined that whatever pluses come in wages or whatever else to people in this country, they are gone so quickly in other costs.  This does not apply only to the employees; it applies to the employers as well.  The one area causing massive difficulty in my constituency, and I am sure in my colleagues' constituencies, is insurance for employers, which is rocketing completely out of control.  The cost of rental premises is also still a factor.  There is no doubt but that all these issues will hit the employer.  As my colleagues pointed out, childcare costs have been a factor for quite a number of years.  We still have not come up with a satisfactory means of ensuring that people going out to work have the proper backup in childcare terms.  The cost of that childcare is an extreme financial weight on so many families.  The OECD average cost of childcare represents approximately 12.6% of a family's net income, whereas in Ireland that figure stands at 27.4%, so there is a huge difference there.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is the biggest employer in the country and in many respects could act as a role model in implementing the living wage in the public sector.  This would set a broader standard without placing an undue legislative burden on employers struggling to keep costs down.  My colleagues have referred to the Low Pay Commission.  It would be a good idea to refer the proposal for a living wage to the commission.  I repeat that we must tackle the issues causing people a lot of financial strain, namely, housing, childcare, insurance and public transport.  We must get those issues right because they affect this whole area.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will table an amendment to the motion.  We have said before that we are supportive of a living wage, but we must be very careful not to drive small employers, who carry a huge burden, out of the employment market because they are very important, particularly to rural Ireland.  I know it is not the Minister's responsibility, but there definitely has not been balanced regional development in my part of the country.  If she asks Deputies Troy, &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v or Penrose about this or goes onto the platforms at Longford, Dromod, Athlone or Roscommon train station, she will see the hundreds upon hundreds of people getting on the trains early in the morning to go to Dublin to work.

The Labour Party's position is clear and unambiguous: no one working full-time should be living in poverty.  The Labour Party supports the living wage and we want to see a genuine living wage become the minimum standard that applies to low-paid workers in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  While I am speaking on the topic of the minimum wage, I wish to refer to the remarks the Government made on budget day and since then on raising the minimum wage.  Just today the Taoiseach said the recommendation of an increase of 30 cent to the minimum wage to &euro;10.10 will proceed in January unless there is a disorderly Brexit.  He said withholding the increase is in line with the recommendations of the commission.  This is not strictly true and, let us be clear, not compatible with the law governing this area.  The commission's recommendations state that the commission acknowledges that in the event of a hard Brexit the Government may need to review the recommended rate.  This is not a recommendation to postpone the increase.  There is an economic argument to be made that a higher rate might be more appropriate, given the need to boost demand in the economy in the event of an economic downturn.  This might well apply to this cohort of 140,000 people, whose standard of living is likely to fall significantly in the event of a hard Brexit, with inflation projected at up to 4%.  The suggestion that the Government might hold off deciding on the rate in the event of a hard Brexit is not provided for by law, and I intend to demonstrate this.<\/p>  <p>  The law is clear: the Minister has three months from receipt of the recommendations to make a decision.  The recommendations of the Low Pay Commission which have just been published are dated July 2019.  It would be interesting to know the precise date on which the Minister received them.  She does not have the luxury of taking a wait-and-see attitude towards Brexit.  I am outraged, as are my Labour Party colleagues, at the way she has handled the issue of the national minimum wage.  It is disgraceful.  The Minister can decide to set a contingent minimum wage rise, with the option of changing her decision in the event of a disorderly Brexit, but this is not what the commission recommended.  She is therefore obliged to lay a statement before both Houses of the Oireachtas outlining the rationale for her decision.<\/p>  <p>  Economic analysis shows that raising the wages of the lowest-paid does not cost jobs in the economy.  There is no evidence to support the Government's threat - and it is a threat - to suspend the increase to the minimum wage.  With inflation running at 1.5%, the 30 cent increase will barely match the rising cost of living, which is why it is so important we take the politics out of setting the minimum wage and focus on the evidence.  In this regard the work of the living wage technical group, based on research by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice on the cost of meeting a minimum essential standard of living, makes a very valuable contribution to our understanding of the cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  I have looked at the legislation in this area.  Under minimum wage legislation, the Low Pay Commission must make an annual report to the Minister, who within three months of the date of receipt of the report must either by order declare a new minimum wage in the terms recommended by the commission or in other terms, or decline to make an order.  If the Minister declines to make an order, she must publish a statement of her reasons for so doing.  It seems that on 9 October the Minister made a short statement on the reasons for declining to make an order declaring the national minimum hourly rate of pay.  According to the statement of reasons, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has declined to make an order declaring the national minimum hourly rate of pay until the situation in respect of Brexit becomes clearer.  The Government amendment to this evening's motion says something different.  It states that \"the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Commission in their entirety; however, given that the terms of Brexit are not yet finalised, the Government has decided that a decision on the date of implementation will be made when the outcome of the Brexit negotiations becomes clearer\".  The reality is that the Minister has not just postponed the decision on the date of implementation; she has invoked her statutory power to decline to make any order.  To be absolutely clear on this, the legislation gives her three months within which to respond.  It does not permit her to postpone a decision beyond that three-month period, so a failure to decide within three months means no decision can be made for another year.  The statutory function of the Minister in respect of this report is now spent.<\/p><p>The Minister had a once-off statutory response to make and she made it.  She has responded to the report of the Low Pay Commission and declined to make an order, as the Act permits her to do.  The result is that not only will the low-paid not get a much-needed pay increase recommended by the Low Pay Commission nor even a smaller increase of 15 cent per hour recommended by employers, as by failing to make any decision, the Minister has lost the power to make any order under the Act for the next year.  The Minister must admit what she has done and justify it rather than pretending about what she has done.  She has not just postponed an increase in the minimum wage, instead she has cancelled it.  There is no room for another order until the commission makes its next annual report.  That is the law, which I have read carefully.<\/p> <p> Today the living wage is &euro;12.30 per hour, whereas the national minimum wage is &euro;9.80, a whole &euro;2.50 lower.  This gap was not as great 20 years ago.  When a national minimum wage was introduced in 2000, it gave workers a guarantee they would be able to meet the basic cost of living.  In 2000, the minimum wage was set at two thirds of the median average income, a level commonly used as a threshold for poverty.  For example, it is used in this way by the European statistics agency, EUROSTAT.  The goal of the minimum wage when it was first introduced was clearly to bring full-time workers above the poverty threshold.  Unfortunately, this did not last long.  In the 2000s the cost of living rose very quickly and although the minimum wage was also increased, it did not keep pace with median incomes.  In 2010, the minimum wage was only 44% of the median income, meaning the minimum wage had fallen in value by a third.<\/p> <p> The national minimum wage should not be a political football.  The State is directed by the Constitution to ensure that citizens, men and women equally, can meet their needs as a result of their occupations.  A good job is the best route out of poverty and if we are to build an equal and fair society, we must ensure work remains an attractive option for anyone who wishes to improve his or her circumstances.  That is why the Labour Party sought to ensure that the national minimum wage is based on evidence and we were instrumental in passing the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, which created the Low Pay Commission.<\/p> <p> The role of the commission is to consider evidence and to make a recommendation about at what level the minimum wage should be set.  This reduces the discretion of the Minister of the day to ignore evidence when setting the minimum wage.  The Low Pay Commission is an important mechanism to hold Ministers to account with respect to the national minimum wage and that is why the Labour Party has proposed an amendment to Sinn F&eacute;in's motion to include reference to the commission.  Specifically, where the original motion ends with a call on the Government to, \"introduce a living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour in 2020\", the Labour Party amendment calls on the Government to, \"instruct the Low Pay Commission to ensure that the national minimum wage becomes a genuine living wage from 2020 onwards\".  The intent of this amendment is to get the Government to modify the remit of the Low Pay Commission so that it sets a national minimum wage at the level of a living wage now and into the future.<\/p> <p> It is important that this motion acknowledges the valuable role of the Low Pay Commission and thereby ensures that all future iterations of the minimum wage are at least set at the level of a living wage, which is currently &euro;12.30 per hour.  As the Sinn F&eacute;in motion rightly indicates, proportionately more women than men tend to work in jobs paying the minimum wage.  Young people are also disproportionately likely to be in low-paid work.  However, approximately half of those on a minimum wage are over 24 so it is by no means limited to young people.  There are full-time workers who are trying to pay rent and put food on the table based on a minimum wage or &euro;1 or &euro;2 more per hour.<\/p> <p> The OECD points out that low pay in Ireland is more frequent than in nearly every other country in Europe.  Nearly a quarter of workers in Ireland, or 23%, are low-paid.  There are whole sectors of the economy, such as retail, farm work, security and child care, where the great majority of workers are on a rate of low pay that is less than a living wage.  There is a growing gap in our country between those with good jobs that pay several times a living wage and those on low pay who cannot meet a basic standard of living despite full-time work.  Some small employers may worry that a higher minimum wage will not be affordable but Fianna F&aacute;il has not read the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500051#YY00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571172000,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1571172000,"counter":572,"content":"<p>However, the law allows for any employer to make a declaration if it cannot afford to pay the minimum wage.  This rarely, if ever, occurs.  We should be clear that if some small employers, like shops located in rural areas, are genuinely unable to meet the specified increase in the minimum wage, the facility exists for them to declare, faithfully and honestly, that they are unable to accede to the direction.  They can then be exempted in specified circumstances.  If we move towards a genuine living wage, this mechanism might be used more often, and that is what it is there for.  Some people might worry that a higher minimum wage might lead to fewer jobs.  However, successive economic studies, including by the International Monetary Fund, have concluded that setting higher wages for the very lowest paid in the economy has little or no effect on employment levels across the whole economy.  Higher wages for the lowest paid end up spent in the local economy, which is beneficial in terms of creating and sustaining jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Higher minimum wages are not a silver bullet for in-work poverty.  We have sought to outlaw zero-hour contracts but there are still many workers who do not have certainty about their hours on a weekly basis or who are working part time because they cannot secure full-time work.  As far as the Labour Party is concerned, it should be the goal of the Government and society to attain genuine full employment, which means a full-time job for everyone who is able to work full-time hours, and a level of pay that is sufficient to avoid poverty or deprivation.  Everyone working full time should be able to attain a minimum essential standard of living, which should be based on evidence of the cost of essential goods and services and set relative to the median income in society.  For these reasons, the Labour Party will support tonight's motion on a living wage and I hope Sinn F&eacute;in will reciprocate and support the Labour Party's amendment that includes the role of the Low Pay Commission.

If the provisions of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion were implemented, it would bring great times for low-paid workers because with an average 40-hour week, they would get an extra &euro;100 into their pockets.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting that IBEC, the employers' organisation, disagreed with the 30 cent per hour increase suggested by the Low Pay Commission and wanted it reduced to 15 cent per hour.  The idea of giving 137,000 of the lowest-paid workers, who are overwhelmingly female and likely to be poorer and from minority backgrounds, any sort of increase seemed to be too much for the Government.  It seems it would wreck the economy if cleaners, retail and hospitality workers might have a few extra bob in their pockets.  We can compare this with the largesse that the Government displays to the chief executives of multinational corporations.  It had no problem granting them a special assignee relief programme, SARP, giving chief executives special continued tax status on their earnings.  That is a move costing this State &euro;28 million in forgone tax.<\/p>  <p>  Low-paid workers are overwhelmingly concentrated in the sectors of the economy where profit levels are back to or exceeding the pre-crash boom levels but workers are not being treated in the same way.  There is no justification like a fragility in an economy but the bogeyman this time is Brexit.  That is the justification for telling workers they cannot even have 15 cent per hour and they are getting absolutely nothing.  At the same time, we have the lowest levels of PRSI paid by employers and one of the lowest levels of benefits paid to workers.  We do not pay workers for their first three days out sick and our levels of maternity and other benefits are the lowest in Europe.  Our safeguards for workers to have the right to join a union are also the weakest in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  At this point I pay tribute to the workers in Delfin English School who are currently striking for a basic right to belong to a union, organise and get paid for the hours they work.  That is not even happening.  Real and substantive change will occur when workers fight back for their rights rather than waiting for this House to deliver them from on high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500052#ZZ00600","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1571172000,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Minister made play tonight of the fact that the Government is not going to cancel the minimum wage increase in the event of a no-deal Brexit but instead it will defer it.

This is at a time when a no-deal Brexit threatens the living standards of ordinary working-class people.  The Government's answer is to prepare to shovel money towards corporations, often with no strings attached, at the same time as putting off a minimum wage increase.  The Government is also determined to ensure that corporations pay little or no tax on those super profits.  Why?  It is because the Government represents the interests of those corporations and of the 1%, not the interests of working people.<\/p>  <p>  The only answer to the organised Government-sanctioned greed of the corporations is the organisation of workers into fighting democratic trade unions to fight for increased wages and decent conditions.

A little under half of one-parent families suffer deprivation.<\/p>  <p>  My understanding of the Low Pay Commission report is that it makes no reference whatsoever to a possible deferral of the recommended increase in the national minimum wage in the event of no-Brexit deal.  I understand why that argument is being used but it is not acceptable.  Legal protections are currently in place for companies that can show they cannot afford to pay the national minimum wage.  There is no legal obligation on businesses which can afford to pay their workers a living wage to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has referred to unintended consequences for business, including that they could lose their profits.  However, the unintended consequences for workers include inability to pay their rent with rents going up.  Others cannot afford to buy their homes.  The cost of insurance and the cost of living are going up.  Workers are being told that they can wait and that labour can wait.  That is what they are being told.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection said she makes no excuses for some prudence and caution, as she believes the public will understand the Government decision to await the outcome of current Brexit developments before setting an implementation date.  I put it to the Minister of State that the public are not saying that.  Rather, they are saying the Government has given breaks to chief executives of multinationals of &euro;28 million in tax foregone.  They are saying that the very people who are making this decision have just pocketed a wage increase one month ago.  During the past two years, there have been three increases amounting to almost &euro;4.50 per hour in wages for them.  The people are not saying that they can accept it or that the Government has to be cautious.  The Government is not cautious when it comes to looking after its friends and the wealthy.  I can say with my hand on my heart that I have foregone that wage increase over the past three years.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with some speakers in the House that the only way workers can achieve a living wage is by taking action.

The union is holding a meeting tomorrow night calling for Dublin city to be a living wage city.  Those involved are calling for people to get organised, to join unions to fight for decent pay and better conditions and to organise against sexual harassment in the workplace.  The hospitality sector is a &euro;5 billion sector.  It has the highest percentage of minimum wage workers, who are some of the lowest paid and vulnerable workers in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Private Members' motion and I support it.  I believe that as activists, we have to get out onto the streets and support workers who are willing to put their heads above the parapet and demand a living wage and proper pay and conditions.

A major contribution has been made by low-paid workers to the economy.  Often, they are in precarious and difficult employment.  It has to be recognised that the adoption of a national living wage will benefit them.  I note the Minister in her speech seemed to denigrate the whole concept of a living wage as a theoretical estimate.  Actually, the difference between the living wage and the national minimum wage is that the living wage is based on real research in the real economy and the real suffering that families endure, as well as the expenses to which they are subject.  I believe the Minister completely misunderstood the whole basis of this debate.  She referred to the tiny 30 cent increase per hour in the national minimum wage and said this had been accepted by the Government.  However, I searched for the reference in the budget speech.  There is no reference whatsoever by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to the national minimum wage in his 34-page speech.  It is completely missing.  Even a derisory 30 cent per hour increase features nowhere and certainly there is no reference whatsoever to a living wage.<\/p>  <p>  Our colleague, Deputy Shortall, has asked on several occasions in recent days where exactly is the poverty-proofing of budget 2020.  Even ten years ago, we would get perhaps two or two and a half pages of a basic attempt to try to look at the impact of the budget on poverty.  It is not in this budget at all.  It was nowhere in the Minister's speech.<\/p>  <p>  In my submission, along with Independent colleagues, to the Minister for Finance, I called for a &euro;7 minimum increase in all social protection benefits and allowances.  That could have been costed at approximately &euro;500 million.  Social Justice Ireland asked for a basic &euro;9 per week increase and argued that was especially merited, given the daunting challenges of Brexit and climate change and the fact that we know there will be major impacts on the most vulnerable families and citizens in this country.  No matter what happens, we know consumer prices are going to rise.  Yet, not alone did the Government not increase the social welfare budget but because of the increase in inflation, the Government actually cut the social protection provision in budget 2020.<\/p><p>As is pointed out in the excellent submission made by Social Justice Ireland on the budget, one in every six people lives on an income that is below the poverty line.  Shockingly, they include one in every five children and this in a country that has a <i>per capita<\/i>GDP figure that is second only to that of Luxembourg.  Such statistics are shameful, particularly when one is talking about people who are prepared to get up early to go out to work on a full or part-time basis.  Fine Gael and its Government partners in Fianna F&aacute;il have always refused to raise the necessary revenue to address the reality of poverty for so many households.  Despite knowing the likely negative impact of Brexit and climate change mitigation measures on the poorest households, they still took no action to move urgently to a national living wage of at least &euro;12.30 per hour, as called for in the motion.  It was interesting to read in the lead-up to budget 2020 that even an economist like David McWilliams who had made a glaring misjudgment in his advice to the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, in 2008 on the bank guarantee was saying a wealth tax was essential, given that 1% of the population owned 27% of the nation's assets and 5% owned almost half of its assets.  It is time to start thinking in terms of a wealth tax, but in the interim we must make an immediate move to introduce a national living wage.  I commend Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500053#AAA00400","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571173200,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak to the motion and compliment its authors.  I had better declare that I am an employer and can speak from that perspective also.  As I said, I am happy to speak to the motion and salute Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing it forward.  <\/p>  <p>  Some of the statistics mentioned in the motion are truly disturbing.  There is no other way to describe them and I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in on its research.  According to Social Justice Ireland, for example, 110,000 workers across the State are at risk of poverty.  That is a shocking number.  When the Taoiseach made his speech on the budget last week in the House, he quoted scripture from the Bible about how he looked after everybody.  The budget was a non-event.  As Deputy Broughan and others said, there was very little in it for anyone.  I normally say it is like snow on a ditch - with the first rays of sunshine, it melts away - but in the case of the budget, the snow did not even land for anybody.  It was so meagre.  Old age pensioners received nothing, while many other groups got so little.<\/p>  <p>  While we need to make every effort to improve the working and pay conditions of workers, we must not take measures that will indirectly make things worse.  That is very important.  I do not have a copy of the Minister's speech, but I heard some of what he said while in my office and agree that we must be very careful not to undermine workers and make things more precarious for them.  We know from an ESRI study last year that the increase in the national minimum wage had a negative and statistically significant effect on the hours worked by workers on the national minimum wage.  Some very big employers are able to manipulate the hours of staff and operate zero hour contracts.  It is very hard to draft legislation to deal with people who want to be devious and abuse workers.  According to the ESRI, it was primarily driven by the large hours effect for workers on the national minimum wage on temporary contracts who experienced a weekly reduction of approximately 3.5 hours.  Where does one go with this?  Wworkers were worse off after reciving the increase which was well intentioned.  <\/p>  <p>  I am sure the motion is also well intentioned, but we must be very clever in the phrasing used within legislation.  We have conflicting data from Eurfound which has shown that implementing a living wage could play a significant role in offsetting the rise of the level of in-work poverty across the European Union.  The data have to be examined.  I am tired of saying it must pay a person to go to work.  It was great for the Taoiseach to say he was interested in people who got up early in the morning, but there is no point in being up early in the morning and out late at night if one is on a pittance and one's work is not respected.  Employers must have respect for their employees.  It is a two-way street.  Employees will respect their employers if they are respected, but the way some multinationals and conglomerates treat their workers is appalling.  We heard so much noise recently about farmers who had been forced onto picket lines to try to get a reasonable and respectful price for their produce.  There were threats issued about the loss of jobs and workers were let go in their hundreds.  The factories are lamenting the fact that they cannot get some of those workers back.  I am talking about AIBP in Cahir.  They cannot get the workers back because they were paying them disgraceful money for doing very difficult work.  Some of the workers found jobs elsewhere and I hope their new employers will hold on to them.  I made the point at the time and say again that many small employers will hold onto their employees in good times and bad because they value and respect them.  There is mutual respect and, if possible, they will hold onto their employees through short-term difficulties, but that did not happen with the moguls in the meat industry.  They were using and abusing, despite the grants they were receiving.  When the so-called deal was reached which involved a pitiful increase of eight cent per kilo, Bord Bia was going to pay it.  It was coming from the taxpayer, with nothing at all coming from the people in question.  It is time we tackled the elephant in the room - the big conglomerates that are taking over the country.  They have no respect for workers, legislators or anyone else.  All they are interested in is greed, profit, what company they can take over next and how many billions they have in their bank accounts.  <\/p>  <p>  As I said, the Eurofound report made it clear that the living wage rate, for a single adult with no dependants, was &euro;11.90 per hour in 2018.  That is 25% higher than the statutory minimum wage of &euro;9.55 per hour.  The report also suggests that, due to regional differentials in the cost of living, the living wage rate for a single adult with no dependants in Dublin is &euro;14.45 per hour, while for a single adult with one child, it climbs to &euro;17.15.  These figures are 37% and 80% higher than the equivalent rates for those living in rural Ireland.  There is a double whammy because the cost of living in Dublin is much higher.  While public services, including public transport, are available, the cost of living, particularly the cost of housing, is totally abnormal.  The Government keeps pumping up Dublin.  I include the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, in that.  I do not know why the Government cannot encourage IDA Ireland to get companies to invest outside Dublin.  It will state it is difficult to get companies to invest in rural Ireland, that they do not want to locate in Limerick, Cork or Galway.  They all want to locate in Dublin.  It is a time bomb waiting to explode.  There are no houses available.  The Minister of State can shake his head all he likes-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500054#BBB00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1571173200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500054#BBB00300","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1571173200,"counter":588,"content":"<p>When I met the head of IDA Ireland in New York, he told me that himself.

Considerable complexity remains in dealing with the issue.  It is not simple and the last thing we want to do is to make the situation worse, rather than better, for workers and employers.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Employees who are treated well and respected respond in kind.  They will go the extra mile, as will their employer.  However, there is a race to bottom with the big moguls in the meat and supermarket industries and even the equine industry.  I salute the prowess of Coolmore Stud, but not the way it treats its workers.  It gives them the lowest rates of pay, despite the billions it makes in profit.  It wants to own the county, if not the country.  It has 28,000 acres, a figure which is growing.  Fine Gael is supporting it, as are my former colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is grabbing up holdings.  The landlord is back in place and it is to hell or to Connacht once more.  No small family farm can compete with Coolmore Stud in buying land.  It throws money here and there to GAA, soccer and rugby clubs, which we appreciate, but it is trying to buy silence.  We will soon not have school, GAA, soccer or rugby teams.

The country is awash with money.  The financial assets of the wealthiest 10% are &euro;50 billion in excess of those in 2006-07.  The country has the fifth-largest number of super-wealthy individuals <i>per capita<\/i>in the world, ahead of countries such as the USA , the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, and only behind significant tax havens such as Hong Kong and Switzerland.  There are 2,055 of these super-rich individuals in the country, or 421 for every 1 million people.  We know from well-worked reports that the wealthiest 10% of individuals own 58.4% of all wealth in the country, the wealthiest 5% own 46.4% and the wealthiest 1% own 27.3%.  The Government, which could not increase the minimum wage in the budget, was able to give special tax concessions to multinational executives at a cost of &euro;28 million.  There is no wealth tax in this country.  The very wealthy do not pay their fair share and never have.<\/p><p>Approximately 760,000 people, or one in six, live below the poverty line in Ireland, the eighth wealthiest country in the world, as do 230,000, or one in five, children.  That is a shameful figure.  It is shameful that so many young children live below the poverty line.  Some 110,000 working families live below the poverty line, while 137,000 workers earn the national minimum wage.  Another shocking statistic is that the bottom 10% of income earners pay the same percentage of their income in tax as do the top 10% of income earners.  Again, that is shameful.<\/p><p>I wish to draw particular attention to the difficulties families experience in respect of the so-called housing assistance payment scheme.  It is an outrageous scheme.  Some 37,000 families on it are in a situation whereby they do not have two halfpennies to rub together at the end of the week.  They must pay rent to the local authority and a top-up to the landlord.  Depending on where one lives, one must pay the landlord between &euro;50 and &euro;150 extra weekly.<\/p><p>In such circumstances, the decision last week by the Government not to increase the minimum wage or provide for a living wage is simply shocking and unacceptable.  We have the money.  As the economist, David McWilliams wrote in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>two weeks ago, now is the time for a wealth tax.  A reasonable wealth tax of between 0.5% and 5% could bring in income of between &euro;2 billion and &euro;20 billion per annum.  The money is there and it should be used to introduce the living wage.  The Minister stated that we should not confuse the minimum wage and the living wage but as far as I am concerned, the living wage should be the minimum wage and it should be introduced immediately.<\/p><p>It is a shame that the Government presides over a situation whereby thousands of public sector employees, including members of the Defence Forces, are paid less than the living wage.  I also highlight the thousands of early childhood care professionals, each of whom earns less than the living wage and most of whom earn little more than the minimum wage.  Some 94% of childcare workers experience difficulty making ends meet and only 9% can cope with unexpected bills.  An illness, bereavement, communion or confirmation may send a family on such low rates of pay into meltdown and, often, into the hands of moneylenders.  I support the motion and believe the &euro;12.30 per hour living wage should be immediately introduced as the minimum wage and increased quickly to approximately &euro;15 per hour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500055#CCC00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1571173800,"counter":591,"content":"<p>Deputy Ellis is sharing time with Deputy Funchion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500055#CCC00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1571173800,"counter":592,"content":"<p>The living wage is an effective and powerful weapon in the fight against poverty.  Many working people are trapped in an endless struggle of fighting to pay bills, put food on the table and avoid poverty.  Low wages can trap people in a poverty cycle that is often too difficult to escape.  As rents, bus and train fares and the cost of living increase, it is often the poorest who are hit the hardest.  For those on low wages, it is often the case that one has a choice between being able to feed one's family properly, buy one's children clothes for school, provide a lunch for them or avoid a debt crisis.  Those are the stark choices for many families I meet every day in my constituency.<\/p>  <p>  Low wages can also lead to the exploitation of workers by unscrupulous employers.  It is immoral to take advantage of often desperate individuals and pay them as little as possible.  It is equally unjust that workers at the bottom of the pay scale suffer so badly, struggling to put food on the table for their families, while many executives and chief executive officers reward themselves with a disproportionate share of profits or give themselves large bonuses.  Such unequal pay distribution leads to social inequality and injustice.<\/p>  <p>  Aside from the issue of morality, there are strong economic benefits to paying workers a living wage.  Obviously, it would raise the standard of living of those are struggling to make ends meet, but in addition, it would help to stimulate the economy by increasing the spending power of workers.  Workers would be able to put more money into the economy through increased consumer spending.<\/p><p>Increased income also means increased Government revenue.  It has been observed that when workers are paid a living wage, worker absenteeism decreases and company turnover can increase.  When employers treat employees with dignity and respect, they give them a sense of having a stake in the company.  This helps companies to realise the potential of their staff, which can increase productivity.  Clearly, this is good for the company and for the economy as a whole.<\/p> <p> It is shameful that last week's budget made no provision for the introduction of a living wage.

The reality is that the living wage gives people a quality of life.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to explain the impact on a person's life of the serious struggle associated with being on the minimum wage or not earning a living wage.  If someone is unable to heat his or her home, or is not eating the correct food or skipping meals, it will have an impact on his or her health.  The stress and worry involved in struggling to pay for anything to do with children, such as schooling, will have an impact on the mental health of the person involved.  We have many debates on mental health issues in this House, but when there is an opportunity to take practical measures to address such matters, the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il seem reluctant to take action.  I note that no Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy has been present in the Chamber for the past hour of this debate.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that time is against me.  I will conclude by mentioning that most of those who fall into this category are women.  Most single parents, most people in low-paid jobs and most people of pension age who are on low pensions, or no pension at all, are women.  They are often forced to make certain choices because of the cost of childcare, etc.  I was delighted Deputy Healy mentioned workers in the childcare and early years sector, who are some of the lowest-paid in the economy.  They often have to sign on over Christmas and during the summer because they do not get paid.  They have some of the worst terms and conditions, even though they are doing one of the most valuable jobs in our society, if not the most valuable.  We need to start rewarding them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500056#DDD00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1571174400,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I support the motion.  I commend my colleagues on its introduction.  If we are serious about dealing with poverty and inequality, we must deal with workers' rights.  This means ensuring workers have a proper wage that provides them with a good basic standard of living.  That is not too much to ask for.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is calling for the introduction of a living wage of &euro;12.30 an hour.  One in five workers living in rented accommodation spends more than half of his or her wages on rent.  This is creating another layer of poverty.  Workers in rural areas, who have no option other than to drive ten, 20 or 30 miles to work in the nearest large town have to contend with sky-high motor insurance costs.  They have no other means of transport and no other way of getting around.  That is the situation they are in.  There is great pressure on workers.<\/p>  <p>  At a time the top 10% of earners in Ireland are in receipt of one third of all income and the top 1% own 27% of all the wealth in the State, approximately 760,000 people, 230,000 of whom are children, are living in poverty.  That is a staggering level of inequality.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, many workers in the hospitality sector and beef plants take home less than &euro;400 a week.  In some cases, they take home less than &euro;300 a week.  How can somebody be expected to survive on that, let alone have a decent standard of living?  Workers in the beef factories are at the pin of their collar.  The owners - Larry maith an fear and others - made profits of &euro;170 million last year.  ABP can certainly afford to pay the living wage, and a lot more with it.  The same can be said of many other employers.  A few years ago, a meat factory in Rathdowney cleared out all of its workers and brought in new workers on the minimum wage.  This is an example of the race to the bottom.<\/p>  <p>  While we recognise that circumstances have to change, we appreciate that some smaller businesses will be genuinely unable to afford to increase wages immediately.  There must be a clause in legislation to exempt such employers and small businesses from this requirement.  We have provided for that in our motion.  Many large businesses, including large hotels, food processors and companies in the beef industry, are taking advantage and exploiting Irish and foreign workers.  We cannot stand for this any longer.  We have a responsibility to legislate for the living wage.  We need to close the gap by giving workers a proper week's wages.  It is time for ordinary workers to get a proper wage for their work.  Lest we forget, one of the final acts of the most recent Fianna F&aacute;il Government was to cut &euro;39 a week from the minimum wage.  That did not benefit the Government of the day.  It was obvious that a strong IBEC lobby was an influencing factor in this regard.  This attitude needs to change.  It is unsurprising that Fianna F&aacute;il is not giving its full support to the motion we are proposing tonight.  We are pushing ahead with it because we believe it is a basic requirement if ordinary workers are to be protected.  I refer to men and women who are working hard in this State.  I am sure the Taoiseach was referring to them when he spoke about people who get up early every morning.  We are talking about them in this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500056#DDD00300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1571174400,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I am pleased to respond to the motion. As the Minister stated, the living wage is an estimate made by a number of representatives of NGOs and academics who comprise the self-appointed living wage technical group.  It is based on research that identifies the income required for the minimum essential standard of living for a single-adult household in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland's statutory national minimum wage and the living wage concept are not conflated or mixed up.  The living wage is a voluntary societal initiative that centres on the social, business and economic case for ensuring that whenever it can be afforded, employers pay a rate of pay that provides an income sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  It is important to emphasise the affordability element of the concept.  As a voluntary initiative, the living wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlements.  The national minimum wage, which has a legislative basis, confers a statutory entitlement on employees and a statutory obligation on employers.  The national minimum wage is the legally binding lowest average hourly rate that can be paid by an employer to an employee.  The rate is set out and governed by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, which applies to all employees, including full-time, part-time, temporary and casual employees, with some exceptions.<\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the Government has accepted all of the recommendations it has made in respect of the national minimum wage.  Since 2015, the national minimum wage has increased by 13.3%.  The most recent figures published by EUROSTAT, which relate to January 2019, show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,656.20 per month.  As the Minister stated, the only country with a higher minimum wage is Luxembourg, where the minimum wage is &euro;2,071 per month.  For comparison purposes, EUROSTAT converts countries' hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates.  Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place but remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It should never be forgotten that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a number of in-work supports for low-income families.  The working family payment provides support to employees with families with low earnings in accordance with the size of each family.  It is currently paid to more than 54,000 families in respect of more than 122,000 children.  In budget 2020, the thresholds for the working family payment were increased by &euro;10 for families of one to three children.  The back-to-work family dividend is another in-work support.  This scheme aims to help families to move from social welfare into employment.<\/p><p>This helps to increase the income of families on low incomes.  For example, for a family with two children the working family payment increases after-tax income by over &euro;137 per week and this will increase to over &euro;147 under budget 2020 in January.<\/p> <p> Another important in-work support for low-income families delivered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is the income disregard on lone parent-related payments.  In budget 2020 the income disregards on one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment increased by &euro;15 to &euro;165 per week.<\/p> <p> Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality, and reducing the at risk of poverty rate for children from just 40.5% to 18.9% has a poverty reduction effect of 53.3%.  Ireland is consistently among the best in the EU reducing poverty through social transfers.  We are well above the EU average of 39%.  <\/p> <p> Again, as part of budget 2020 the Government accepted the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage be increased by 30 cent to &euro;10.10.  As the House knows, the commission made its recommendations on the basis of an ordinary Brexit.  The Government has accepted the recommendations of the commission.  However, given that the terms of Brexit have not yet been finalised the Government has decided that a decision on the date of implementation will be made on the outcome of the budget negotiations as they become clearer.  I hope they will become clearer in the very near future and that the 30 cent recommendation from the low pay commission is implemented.<\/p> <p> I respect the commission.  In a previous job as a Minister of State, I had responsibility for the Low Pay Commission.  It is an independent body which carries out in-depth analysis of the minimum wage and the areas affected by it.  I remember during my time it went to the Border region.  It is made up of academics and trade union and business representatives.  It is an important group which is independent of Government.  I commend the Government's amendment to the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500056#DDD00400","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571175000,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I have been in the D&aacute;il for three years and have listened to some waffle in my time.

The Official Report will confirm what I have said.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of our motion was simple, that is, to stand up for ordinary low-paid workers.  They are hard-working people who struggle to get by month-to-month.  Sinn F&eacute;in is proud to stand up for these people and will continue to fight for better pay and conditions for workers.  I cannot accept the Government's arguments that this is not about Brexit.  This was a political choice, and the wrong choice at that.  Earlier today the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the change would come in January, but the Government's amendment states that the Government decided that a decision on the date of implementation would be made when the outcome of Brexit negotiations become clear.  Which is it?  It is very vague; both statements cannot be true.<\/p>  <p>  As I said at the start of the debate, legal protections already exist to support businesses which find themselves in difficult financial situations, and this will be the case in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  Job losses and business closures are a total red herring.  Section 41 of the Minimum Wage Act 2000 provides legal protection for businesses.  The Minister of State should familiarise himself with the legislation and the protection it provides.  Of course, Fine Gael found the cash needed to line the pockets of very wealthy executives with the extension of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, because when it comes to the wealthy it is always there for them.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies have unfortunately left the building.  Their opposition to our motion is very unfortunate and their amendment is confusing.  Their contributions were pathetic.  They clearly did not read the motion.  I am confused as to why they think workers in the public service deserve a living wage but those in the private sector do not.  Why would they differentiate between workers?  Rent is not cheaper for those working in the private sector compared to the public sector.  It is a bizarre approach.<\/p>  <p>  Two weeks ago, in classic Fianna F&aacute;il fashion, Deputy Eugene Murphy hosted a SIPTU briefing in the AV room calling for a living wage for early years educators.  In its amendment to the motion, Fianna F&aacute;il called for a living wage to be referred to the Low Pay Commission.  Did it mention this policy shift to Big Start and SIPTU or is it hoping they will not hear about it at all?  That sort of Fianna F&aacute;il politics needs to be called out.  I am glad it had the opportunity to put its money where its mouth is and let low paid workers know it does not represent their interests.  We will not support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment.<\/p>  <p>  On the points made by the Labour Party and Solidarity, I am glad to hear their support for the living wage.  It is important this motion gets as much support as possible.  Unfortunately, we cannot accept the Labour Party's amendment.  We do not intend to undermine the Low Pay Commission.  In our vision for introducing a living wage the Low Pay Commission will continue in its current form and will continue to set the minimum wage which would remain the absolute floor for those businesses granted an exemption.  However, I am not confident that the living wage can be achieved under the current Low Pay Commission.  We believe direct Government action is needed to increase wages for those on low pay and remove them from the threat of living at the risk of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  Such is the urgency of the matter that we believe direct Government action is the best approach.  In terms of Solidarity's point, we support the work of the living wage technical group and the rate it has calculated of &euro;12.30 per hour for the time being.<\/p>  <p>  In her contribution the Minister, Deputy Doherty, made a long speech, quite a bit of which was copied by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, but left out one line at the end of her script.  It stated that, \"Unlike Fianna F&aacute;il we are not reckless in our approach and won't be creating a situation where we have to actually cut the minimum wage as they previously did\".  I wonder why she left that line out.<\/p>  <p>  Low paid workers have waited long enough to be given a break.  It is not acceptable that workers in 2019 are living hand-to-mouth from month-to-month and this needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The current minimum wage is not fit for purpose and we need a living wage across the island.  In government Sinn F&eacute;in would deliver a living wage for all workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500057#EEE00400","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571175000,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1571175000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Vot&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500057#EEE00600","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1571175000,"counter":603,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 17 October 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019101500057#EEE00700","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571175000,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 October 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
