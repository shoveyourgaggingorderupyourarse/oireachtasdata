The average rent now stands at &euro;1,400 per month.  It has been going up continuously for nine years.  Alarmingly, economist, Ronan Lyons is warning that the market could face another ten years of high rents and rent misery if the Government continues to settle for a system that depends on the likes of cuckoo funds to prop up the rental market.  Meanwhile, Threshold is warning that the continuing high rents are forcing more and more people into homelessness and many more are under the threat of homelessness.  Alarmingly across the country there are only approximately 3,500 homes available for rent.  In Dublin 8, rents have gone up 125% over nine years.<\/p> <p>We all have to agree that rents have been at an unaffordable level for many years.  In Cork the average rent is &euro;1,372; in Galway, &euro;1,300; and in Limerick, &euro;1,219.  All of this should act as a catalyst for fundamental change in housing policy.  In particular, younger people have been failed badly by current policies.  A young person today is finding it impossible to pay these rents.  Young couples, in particular, are finding it impossible to save deposits while paying exorbitant rents in tandem with credit constraints.  Clearly, the rent controls in place are not working, contrary to what the Minister said in the D&aacute;il last month.  The various solutions with which the Government has come up have not been effective or had an impact.<\/p> <p> Local authority income eligibility thresholds to qualify for a local authority house are very low.  Accordingly, thousands of people on relatively modest incomes are trapped in this high rent misery.  It is time for the Government to consider imposing a rent freeze, given the exorbitant levels of rent people are facing.  Will the Taoiseach accept that it will be another ten years of misery, according to the comments of the economist Ronan Lyons this morning?  Will he accept that current policies are simply not working and that, in particular, a whole generation of young people have been failed and can never look forward to the prospect of owning their own home, which is their wish?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573567500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that rents relative to incomes are high, which is a real problem.  They have become unaffordable for many, particularly those living in cities.  In the Government&rsquo;s view, the solution is twofold, namely, rent controls and an increase in housing supply.  Rent controls which are in place mean that for an existing tenancy, the rent cannot be increased in any given year by more than 4%.  As the Deputy knows, the statistics produced today by <i>daft.ie<\/i>do not capture this but only new tenancies.  Rent controls, with a maximum rent increase of 4% a year, are working for hundreds of thousands of people who are staying in the same place they have been renting in the medium to long term.  If it had not been for these rent controls, these hundreds of thousands of people would have faced high rent increases by now.  That is not captured in the statistics, as Assistant Professor Lyons said, because these are new tenancies and the statistics do not apply to existing tenancies.<\/p><p>The second aspect of the solution has to be more supply.  If there was more supply of social housing, it would ensure people could move out of private rented accommodation, the housing assistance payment and rent supplement into social housing.  We will provide an extra 10,000 social houses this year, more than in any other year this century.  We will ramp up that figure to 11,000 units the following year and 12,000 the year after that.  It is the biggest social housing programme in many decades.<\/p><p>There will also be an increase in the supply of private housing, with more places for people to buy to ensure they will not have to rent anymore.  This will free up properties for others to rent and ensure more places to rent.<\/p><p>I am pleased that another set of statistics was out yesterday which showed a significant increase in the supply of housing.  In the year to September, there was a 28% increase in the number of commencement notices.  There had been concerns that the number was slowing down.

In terms of a deposit in 1987, a young couple would have had to pay 30% of their net annual earnings.  This increased to 50% by 2014.  God knows what it is now.  If the Taoiseach were to go out and talk to people, he would know this is the big issue.  Young people are very angry and their parents are very angry.  When one knocks on doors one is told by parents there are five or seven people living in the house because their adult children cannot afford to rent.

For the 14th quarter in a row, average rents have risen.  The average rent in Cork is now &euro;1,372 per month.  In Dublin, it is over &euro;2,000 per month.  This rental crisis - and it is beyond question a crisis - is crushing workers and families.  It is costing people &euro;2,000 per month, which equates to &euro;24,000 per annum, to put a roof over their heads, not to mind the cost of food, insurance or sending children to school.<\/p> <p>It is the same story in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and anywhere else in the State.  There are sky-high rents and no action.  The figures do not lie.  They are crippling people entirely.  While they are shocking, they are more than just figures.  They are the mother with two kids facing homelessness because her landlord has just hiked her rent.  They are the young people desperately rifling through <i>daft.ie<\/i>just to find anything remotely affordable within commuting distance of their work.  They are the couples who have no chance of saving up for a deposit on their own home.  A whole generation is being locked out of every having any option of having a permanent home.  People have lost hope of that.  Thousands of people pay rent that in reality they cannot afford.  Inevitably, other things suffer.  Hard decisions are made on what bills to pay and what a family can afford to let kids participate in.  People dread trying to shop for decent food on a pathetic budget.  <br\/><br\/>Renters in Cork and throughout the State have been badly let down by the Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il partnership Government.  They have done nothing to reduce the cost of rents or to protect tenants from further rent increases.  It just goes on and on.  As has been noted, the reality is this is pushing more and more families closer to homelessness.  There are 5,000 households on the public housing waiting list in Cork city.  Homelessness figures in Cork reached 435 at the end of September.  Rents in Cork city reached an all-time high, with renters having to spend 47% more than mortgage holders to live in a three-bed house.  The Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il housing policy is not working.  It is failing Cork and it is failing everyone else.  It is time for real solutions.  For a long time we heard Fianna F&aacute;il criticising us for a lack of solutions.  I am interested that for the first time, Fianna F&aacute;il is talking about a rent freeze, something that Sinn F&eacute;in has been talking about for a long time.  That is something real and actionable that the Government can do and that this side of the House has been calling for a long time.  Now Fine Gael's coalition partner is calling for it.  Will the Taoiseach now take the step that is clearly required to stop these runaway rents that are forcing people into poverty and homelessness?

While a rent freeze might work for people who are renting already because their rent would not rise, it might cause less new supply.

To do that, we must increase the supply of social housing for people who are on the housing list, getting them out of private rented accommodation, off HAP and rent supplement and into social housing.  Some 10,000 new social homes were provided this year, more than any year of this decade.  We are ramping it up as quickly as we can with 11,000 next year, 12,000 the year after and 60,000 over the next five years.

As a result, we have a big deficit of housing in this country, which is at the root of the problems we face.  Finally, we are getting to the position where we are seeing real and sustained increases in supply.

Because of the positive role of immigration, we retain a relatively young population compared with most of Europe.  We have to plan for the growing number of older citizens and for the gradual increase in the average age of the population.  We do not have to have what at present is the highest retirement age in Europe.  Right now, people are not entitled to the State pension until the age of 66.  This is due to rise to 67 in 2021.  That would put Ireland into a small group of countries with the highest retirement age in Europe.  We are living longer.  In future, people who go to third level education will likely only begin their careers in their mid-20 or later and probably will work beyond the age of 65 but we are not there yet.  Many people who are now approaching retirement came into the labour market in their teens and have already done up to 50 years of work and paid up to 50 years of tax and social insurance contributions.<\/p> <p>They have made their contribution to society and it is unjust to force them to wait another two years to receive their pensions.  Many are tied into contracts that require them to retire at the age of 65 years.  Some may choose to work longer if they can, but many of them do not have that option.  For someone who may have been working in the same job for decades to suddenly seek a new job at the age of 65 years is not easy.  Some employers may be reluctant to take on people in their 60s.  Those in this cohort end up seeking jobseeker's benefit.  The Government has created an exception to the rules for jobseeker's benefit to allow the payment to continue until a person retires, but there is no need to require thousands of older people to enter a pre-retirement period to wait for their pensions.  The Social Insurance Fund is projected to have a surplus of &euro;3.8 billion by the end of the year.  We now have funds to pause or slow down the increase in the retirement age and give society time to adjust in order that those entering the labour force later can project themselves working later.  We have the opportunity not to proceed in the timeframe forced on us when we were in the troika programme.  In my judgment we can afford to allow 66 year olds to continue to access the full State pension, for which they have more than paid.  Will the Taoiseach reflect, as I have done, and agree that it is time to pause the current plan to increase the waiting time again in 2021?  Should we not give society and the economy more time to adjust before raising the retirement age beyond the current age of 66 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200007#E01500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573569600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Deputy has acknowledged that there is now a budget surplus and that the Social Insurance Fund is back in surplus.  In fact, it has been in surplus for several years.  It recorded a small technical surplus last year and it looks like that it is going to record a bigger surplus this year than was even projected on budget day, notwithstanding the views of some, including the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, that it would not do so.<\/p>  <p>  The State pension age is due to rise to 67 years in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  It is true that we are doing this ahead of most other European countries, but other European countries are also raising the retirement age.  The reform was introduced by my forebear in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and we supported it because it was important to make pensions sustainable.  I have a lot of sympathy for the Labour Party sometimes when it does not receive enough credit for the tough decisions it made when in government with us for five years.  I do not believe it gets enough credit for that and have said this before.  However, I have no sympathy for the fact that the Labour Party, largely for electoral reasons, is now trying to move away from reforms it introduced .  That is unfortunate.  It is as simple as this: in the 1970s the State pension age was, believe it or not, 70 years.  The average man lived to 68 years and the average woman to 72.  The whole idea was that, over the course of one's working life, one paid a small amount into a pension fund in order to have enough for the short number of years for which one would be retired.  A wonderful thing has happened since in that life expectancy has improved.  People are living much longer, which is great, but it raises questions about the sustainability of the pension system in the long term.  If we do not start to raise the pension age now, we may find that people now in their 30s, 40s or 50s will not receive a pension at all at a certain point.  Knowing that is why Deputy Burton introduced the reforms.  Essentially, Deputy Howlin is saying that since we do not now have a problem, we should put off taking action.  Is that not what was said about climate change 20 or 30 years ago?  Is it not what was said about so many other things?  It has been said that since we do not have the problem now, we should not fix it, that we should wait until it is a problem before we fix it.  What Deputy Burton decided to do was to get ahead of the problem and make sure pension payments would be sustainable in the longer term by making reforms in order that we would not have to wait until there was a problem to fix.  I am disappointed that the Labour Party has moved away from that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200008#F00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1573569600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I had hoped the Taoiseach might once look objectively at a serious proposal in changed circumstances, rather than always trying to be so partisan.

The top five countries to which money was transferred in the past eight year include &euro;843 million to Lithuania and &euro;1 billion to France.  The top three countries were: &euro;1.54 billion to Poland, &euro;2.7 billion to the United Kingdom and &euro;3.54 billion to Nigeria.  These figures have been published by the World Bank which defines \"personal remittances\" as the sum of personal transfers and the compensation of employees.  It includes all current transfers in cash or in kind between resident and non-resident individuals independent of the source of income of the sender.  The World Bank is an internationally recognised organisation and its data come from the International Monetary Fund.  I can understand the transfers to other EU countries, for example, money being transferred to the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, with over 100,000 British people living in Ireland and over 10,000 Irish students currently studying in the United Kingdom.  The fact that people living in Border counties may do their banking in the North is also a factor.  But Taoiseach, &euro;3.4 billion transferred to one non-EU country is astronomical.

The root cause of why we had to issue a boil water notice in October was that in both instances, the emergency alarm that was activated did not lead to a stop in production.  That has since been remedied.  There is now an automatic kill switch where the alarm is raised.  That was recommended to be put in in March and Irish Water wanted it to be put in in March.  That was resisted by the plant operator but it is now in place.  The latest boil water notice that is in place at the moment, which we hope will be lifted very soon, is for a separate reason related to filtration systems, which are getting investment at present under the funding we put in place.  Those filters are being worked on, and the sooner they can be finished, the more the risk of further boil water notices recedes.<\/p>  <p>  Investment is incredibly important.  Just yesterday we turned the sod on &euro;39 million going into new wastewater treatment services in Kildare.  I was with the Deputy in Cork on Friday, when we were at the site of social houses being constructed at present.  Before that I was at the new treatment plant on the River Lee, which has not been invested in in 50 years.  These types of investment will protect people into the future.  We have identified the Leixlip plant previously as being of particular concern.  That is why those investments are under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200012#K01200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1573572600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has been forced yet again to deny that there has been another delay to the national broadband plan.

That is the second highest number in the State.

From the many statistics available to the Taoiseach, can he tell us when exactly he predicts that these numbers will start to decline?  There is conflicting evidence regarding housing construction figures.  Planning permissions are no guide to the building of houses.  We know that from the strategic development zone, SDZ, figures, that the majority have not commenced, one year after receiving planning permission.  Given all the spin deployed on the housing issue, many people are genuinely confused, or have been deliberately confused, about the true picture.  It is clear that the core targets of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government's policy, have been missed.  In the best possible scenario, the plan's targets have been missed every single year.  Can the Taoiseach explain why Rebuilding Ireland's targets for new homes continue to be missed?<\/p>  <p>  Earlier in answering Leaders' questions, he exuded a certain degree of complacency - everything is all right and it is moving in the right direction.  Homelessness is not moving in the right direction.  The attitude in Fine Gael seems to be that it is all rental, rental, rental, co-living and build to rent.  I saw Senator Noone's statement about 88 units in Coolock, which used the phrase \"100% social housing\", as if that was terrible and should not happen.  We need more social housing.  The councils need to build more houses and the scale of housebuilding by the State should be far more dramatic than it is.  It should intervene in respect of affordable and social housing. <\/p>  <p>  On the broader issue of social policy, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, was interviewed yesterday about the fact that her press adviser is paid &euro;20,000 more than the average paid to those working for other Ministers.

This follows the expert review carried out by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir.  Specifically, the group noted that removing private activity from public hospitals is technically feasible but dependent purely on political will.  Ireland has the highest proportion of private health care insurance of any European country, representing 45% of the population, according to the Health Insurance Authority.  In 2018, premium income from private health insurance rose to &euro;2.85 billion.  If plans to end private medicine in public hospitals were followed through, it is suggested that private facilities and, ultimately, the demand for private insurance would become redundant over approximately ten years.  These sums would then be freed up to be invested in quality, single-tier public healthcare systems.

Those fees will go up to &euro;1,250 a month while 20 of the parents will lose their kids&rsquo; places in the cr&egrave;che.  This is because Tusla told the cr&egrave;che it needed to make changes, which it did.

From time to time, we introduce schemes to regularise undocumented migrants in the country.  This is not an amnesty.  It has been agreed at EU level that there will not be amnesties.  That is part of our commitment to our European partners.  Any time we have a scheme to regularise undocumented migrants, we always need to consult with the United Kingdom because it has an impact on the common travel area.<\/p>  <p>  Within the confines of the common travel area and the EU pact not to have any amnesties, we do from time to time have schemes to regularise migrants.  The one we had recently was a scheme to regularise people from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, as well as their dependants, who came here on a student visa but became undocumented for one reason or another.  That just finished up this year.  We regularised 2,000 people under the scheme and it worked well.<\/p>  <p>  It is a useful scheme for me when I go to the United States because I can then say in Congress and the White House that we are not asking the American authorities to do anything for our undocumented there that we have not done here in Ireland.  If the US were to copy our scheme, essentially it would provide a pathway to regularisation to anybody who came to the US on a J-1 or a student visa and who became undocumented there.<\/p>  <p>  The other group, referred to by Deputy Burton, we want to look at next is those who came to Ireland as children and know no other home than Ireland.  They will not be deported.  They never really lived in the country in which they were born or, in some cases, the country in which their parents were born, as some of them were born in Ireland.  We need to get these arrangements right and ensure they are properly organised.  We must ensure it cannot be abused or undermines our commitments to the European Union or to the common travel area.  I have met some of those young people, as has Deputy Burton.  They have grown up here and speak with Dublin, Cork or Donegal accents.  They will not be deported.  It will be correct to regularise them but we just need to get it right.  We got it right for the students.  We can get it right for those who Americans would call dreamers.<\/p>  <p>  The policy of universal healthcare is to provide free or highly subsidised healthcare for all.  There are many models across the European Union under which that can be done.  There is often an assumption in Ireland that the NHS is the system they have across Europe.  It is not.  Every country has a different public health system.  Sl&aacute;intecare does not prescribe which model we should follow.  It refers to co-payments, free services and many other matters.  It must, however, be done step by step.<\/p>  <p>  We have made much progress already on GP care.  Nearly half the country has access to free GP care.  That will be extended to children aged seven and eight years of age next year, having extended it to those on lower incomes by increasing the income limits this year and to carers the year before.  We are also reducing prescription charges for those with medical cards and those who do not have one.  By reducing the drugs payment scheme, DPS, threshold, that will continue.  We are extending eligibility for medical cards.  One of the first things the Fine Gael-Independent Alliance Government did was to give medical cards as a right to children with serious disabilities, regardless of their parents&rsquo; income.  Under previous Governments, they were often subject to review.  Children with serious disabilities could lose their medical cards because their parents&rsquo; incomes went up.  That does not happen any more.  Any child in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, DCA, is also entitled to a medical card, regardless of his or her parents&rsquo; income.  The next change will be around improving the income limit for the over-70s to ensure more people over 70 can contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200018#Q00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575300,"counter":232,"content":"<p>There are fewer medical cards than there were two years ago, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200018#Q00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575300,"counter":233,"content":"<p>The number of medical cards goes up and down.

We are making some progress.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked me a fair question on when the number of people living in emergency accommodation and the number of homeless people will go down.  The truth is I cannot answer that question.  I can tell him that we have taken more people out of homelessness in the past year than ever in the country&rsquo;s history.  The numbers becoming homeless is roughly the same, however.  That is why the numbers have been roughly the same for the past year or so.<\/p>  <p>  The drivers of homelessness are different ones.

We have never taken more people out of homelessness.  At the same time, as many people become homeless, and there is no way of predicting that for sure.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth putting on the record that in the year before Rebuilding Ireland was introduced as our policy, the numbers of families who were homeless increased by 60%.  In the past year, the numbers of families who were homeless increased by 0.17%.  That shows the difference Rebuilding Ireland has made.  It has not got the numbers down yet but before Rebuilding Ireland, homelessness was rising by 60% a year.  In the past year, it has only risen by just over 0.17%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200018#Q00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575300,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We are running out of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200018#Q00700","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575300,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Who was in government the year before that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200018#Q00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575300,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Lies, damned lies and statistics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200018#Q00900","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We are meeting our targets in social housing.<\/p><p>The special adviser to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, is a secondee from another part of the public service.

This situation is extraordinary.  Earlier this year, Deputy McGuinness asked the Taoiseach why there had not been an inquiry, for which the majority of the D&aacute;il had voted.  The Taoiseach rejected that and set out that the intent of the scoping exercise was to examine the different aspects and claims of the case and to attempt to scope out what an inquiry would look like.  The Taoiseach also noted that the matters for investigation extend beyond the Garda.  Bearing this in mind, is it not of serious consequence that not only has the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, rejected Judge Haughton's terms of reference, he has narrowed the terms of reference published by him in February?  This is difficult to understand in light of the fact that one reason this issue came to the floor of the D&aacute;il was because the family and many independent observers were not confident in the quality of the previous reviews.  It appears that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is limiting the judge to take into account the outcome of the previous reports prepared and not a review of the investigations, which, in the view of many people, are significantly flawed.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach and the Government support the motion tonight tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il to reinstate Judge Haughton's original terms of reference and, if not, will they proceed with an independent public inquiry as already demanded by a majority of Oireachtas Members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200019#R00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575900,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a specific issue around the security brief, namely, the issue of hard drugs, which are at the core of most organised crime in our country, and the personal and community devastation which they cause.  While the statistics provided for Ireland are behind those for many other countries, the overall picture relating to drug use is clear and disturbing.  Following Brexit, Ireland will have the highest rate of high-risk opiate use in Europe.  More people are dying from overdoses than road accidents.  What we did in terms of road accidents many years ago points to the type of response required.  The Taoiseach will be aware that this is not only an issue in the large urban areas in that it has, for the first time, spread to many provincial communities and there is a growing fear for what the consequences are and will be.<\/p>  <p>  There are many dimensions to this problem.  The only way of getting to grips with it is to take a whole-of-government approach involving security, education, community development and health actions.  Nobody believes that the current level of attention or urgency being given to this issue at national level is anywhere near what is required.  The damage caused by the downgrading of community development and drugs policy since 2011 has been significant.  The policy of devolving many actions to local authorities has not worked, by any measure.  The fact that so many Ministers of State came together last week to highlight this point, particularly around the community development dimension, is an indication of this.  There is no obvious commitment to coming down hard and early when drugs first appear in the community.  The failure to deliver treatment and intervention services at the required level is undeniable.  <\/p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach believe that current policies are adequate and are delivering and that the current highly devolved and hands-off approach is working, particularly in comparison to the previous approach, which had succeeded in many communities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200019#R00800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1573575900,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I want to raise with the Taoiseach the issue of crime, particularly gangland crime in Dublin, as well as the gangs that operate along the Border, apparently with impunity, particularly given the terrible actions and torture inflicted on Kevin Lunney as he was carrying out his work in Quinn Industrial Holdings, QIH.  In the constituency of Dublin West, which the Taoiseach and I represent, there are an incredible number of gangs who are operating in respect of the drugs trade.  They are offering children as young as eight to 14 years bikes, trainers and other rewards if they will become runners for them, with horrific consequences for those children down the line.  <\/p>  <p>  We know that in comparison with other countries, Ireland has a relatively low ratio of garda&iacute; and policing per head of population.  Does the Taoiseach have any proposals to increase the number of garda&iacute; and to introduce further measures against the gangs?  In regard to the current epidemic of cocaine use, much of it is among well-off middle class people who think it is okay to take cocaine at the weekend with no subsequent consequences.

I disagree, however, with his ill-informed comment that the people have been let down by local members of the Garda because I believe they have been let down by the State.  Should local members of the Garda be left to deal with such serious cross-Border criminal activity, smuggling and the campaign of violence that has been set out to all people in the last couple of weeks?

On the Shane O'Farrell case, which will be debated later in the House, we all accept that the process has taken much longer than any of us would have liked.  However, Deputies will appreciate that the terms of the reference of the scoping exercise - it is normal to do a scoping exercise before a commission of inquiry - must be compliant and in line with jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court in the case of Shatter <i>v. <\/i>Guerin, which judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court after the original terms of reference had been finalised.  This is what gave rise to this change.  <\/p><p>The terms of reference for the scoping exercise are focused, as required by the law and as clearly set out in the Supreme Court in Shatter <i>v. <\/i>Guerin, to reduce the risk of legal challenge to the recommendations of the scoping exercise.  The judgment requires that the terms of reference of the scoping exercise be as specific as possible to remove any potential ambiguity and also focused enough to provide a timely outcome to ensure fairness to all parties.  However, they still allow for a review of the issues intended.  <\/p><p>Judge Haughton is free to make any recommendations that he sees fit and the O'Farrell family are also free to make any representations to Judge Haughton in regard to any matter that they would wish to see inquired into in any future inquiry.  The focused terms of reference of the scoping exercise also allow consideration of what broader public policy issues highlighted by the case, such as breaches of bail conditions and execution of warrants, merit further consideration.  Throughout the process, the Department of Justice and Equality has consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and we are all anxious to see progress on this matter.  <\/p> <p>I ask Deputies to understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot, and should not, prejudge Mr. Justice Haughton's report or change the terms of reference, just as he is about to issue his initial report, in a way that does not comply with the law.  I understand that Mr. Justice Haughton may be able to produce his report in the next few days.<\/p> <p> In response to some of the questions I was asked on drugs policy, we have a national cross-government drugs strategy monitored by the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy.  The implementation of the national drugs strategy is driven by the national oversight committee, which has 35 members.  We recently added a civil servant from my Department to that committee.  Some 11 of the 35 members represent task forces in the community sector so they are very much involved in the oversight committee.  I am of the view, as is the Government, that our approach to illegal drugs should be health-led rather than criminal justice-led.  However, we need to acknowledge that it has a criminal justice aspect because so much of it is connected to crime and criminal activity.  In terms of the kind of things we are doing, people will be aware of the efforts the Government is making to provide a new injecting centre in Merchant's Quay.  We are working with Merchants Quay Ireland on that.  Unfortunately, the city council refused planning permission but we are going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la because we want to do it.  We have agreed with the Simon Community to build a 100-bed addiction services centre for people who are homeless and who are addicts to get them off the streets and into a centre where they can have their addiction treated.  We are working with the Simon Community on that.  We have also made Naloxone much more available.  That drug can be used almost instantly to save somebody from an opioid overdose.  It was not widely available five or six years ago but it is now.  On foot of the expert group report, we are going to move away from a situation whereby if somebody is found in possession of a small amount of drugs for personal use, the default option is prosecution and towards a more health-led approach, giving somebody the option of attending a health-led rehabilitation programme.  We do not want to end up in a situation whereby we criminalise large numbers of people for possession of a small amount of illegal drugs.  That is not an approach that has worked but we are not going as far as full decriminalisation or legalisation.  I know some people would call for that but we are not going to go that far.<\/p> <p> On Garda resources, the budget for the Garda next year is &euro;1.88 billion, which is the biggest budget for the Garda ever. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200019#R01100","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573576500,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Community development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200020#S00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1573576500,"counter":257,"content":"<p>To answer the question that was asked, the number of garda&iacute; has increased every year for four or five years ago now.

Core funding and capitation grants for schools and funding in third level are simply not up to it and students, particularly those outside Dublin, are in effect being priced out of their entitlement to third level education.<\/p>  <p>  I want specifically to raise the issue of special education and education for children with additional needs.  I attended a meeting last night with a number of principals in my constituency.  The community healthcare organisation area that we are in, CHO 4, has the longest waiting list in the country for assessment of needs.  Beyond assessment of needs, which is the issue that generated the headlines, the system of therapies for children once they have had an assessment is entirely broken.  The organisations that provide these therapies are doing their best.  Some of these assessments are done privately but there is no continuity of care then.  In Cork, a charity, Marian House, provides therapies but children are not getting the therapies that they need.  This has a serious impact on the children and their families and I believe it has an impact on society as a whole.  These children are failed when they only get speech and language therapy or occupational therapy every few years.  School principals are not trained in that regard and they are forced to try to figure out this stuff as best they can.  What is needed is an entire re-evaluation of the special education system in the State because the Department of Education and Skills is blaming the Department of Health, which says it is not its problem.  The co-operation between the two is not good enough, particularly in respect of the Department of Health, but the Department of Education and Skills needs to do much more as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200020#S02500","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1573576500,"counter":280,"content":"<p>It is over three years since a Programme for a Partnership Government was agreed.

Does the Taoiseach believe this commitment will be delivered on?<\/p>  <p>  On mental health services, it is widely acknowledged that the consistent failure of the Minister for Health to implement agreed plans and the use of mental health services funding to balance overspending elsewhere have led directly to a failure to deliver the level and quality of services that are so badly needed.  The Government had the tools and the funding, but the Minister did not deliver services on the ground.  In County Wexford, in particular, there is huge anger surrounding the issue of mental heath services.  As part of the confidence and supply arrangement we secured extra funding every year for mental health services.  Each year much of it has not been spent and the teams in place throughout the country have been understaffed.  That is particularly true in the case of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.

There are also challenges within that sector, but it is one in which the country is doing well.  We know, for example, how well children are performing relative to their counterparts in maths and reading.  The education budget this year is &euro;11 billion and will go up again next year.  It is the biggest ever education budget in the history of the State.  No Government has invested more in education than this one which is made up of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance.  In practical terms, it means more teachers.  We now have the lowest ever pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools.  We have been able to increase capitation grants but not fully restore them.  This has enabled pay restoration to take place for hard-working teachers and other staff in the education sector, while a huge school building programme is evident all over the country, as well as in universities and institutes of technology.  There are now approximately 15,000 special needs assistants and more special classes than ever before, as well as a very substantial special educational needs budget of &euro;1.7 billion.  There are record numbers making it to third level, which is very encouraging and really important for our future.  There are more people than ever before from non-traditional backgrounds attending higher education.  We have reformed the curriculum, of which people will be aware.  We have, for example, the reformed the junior cycle programme with the introduction of new subjects like physical education and computer science which are examination subjects for the first time.  <\/p>  <p>  On the general election date, no date has been discussed or agreed.  My view is well known and was set out in writing in August 2018. <\/p>  <p>  On the St. Joseph's dementia care facility, I am aware that discussions are ongoing.  The objective absolutely is to ensure the centre will be sustainable into the future.  The briefing material I have available tells me that rather than the funding being at a minimal level, the centre is receiving among the highest levels of funding for patients of any provider contracted by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  There may well be very good reasons for this, namely, the very high quality of care provided, or perhaps the acuity and needs of the patients.  Rather than the funding being at the minimal level, as the Deputy suggested, it is in the top five or six organisations funded by the NTPF.  There is active engagement by the HSE and the NTPF with the provider to secure the future of the service.<\/p>  <p>  On mental health services, the budget will be over &euro;1 billion in 2020 for the very first time, up from approximately &euro;750 million a couple of years ago.  We all acknowledge that there is more to providing health services than providing funding.  Health services here are well funded by international standards.  We have a relatively young population, but perhaps do not achieve the outcomes people are entitled to expect.  However, we are seeing some positive changes when it comes to mental health services.  The new forensic mental health hospital in Portrane is almost finished and will open next year.  It will come in on time and on budget and enable us to close the Victorian facilities in Dundrum.  The waiting lists for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, are falling and have fallen by about 25% in the past couple of months, which is positive.  The funding provided for the National Office of Suicide Prevention and implementation of the suicide strategy is showing some results, with a 30% fall in the number of suicides.  It is not all down to the funding provided by any means, but it is at least moving in the right direction.  We will launch very soon the first 24\/7 helpline for people suffering mental health difficulties.  There are a lot of mental health services in Ireland, but sometimes they are not joined up very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200021#T00800","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1573577100,"counter":289,"content":"<p>What about the situation in County Wexford?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200021#T00900","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1573577100,"counter":290,"content":"<p>This will create a pathway by which people will be able to contact a 24\/7 helpline in two weeks, time to access the services they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200021#T01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1573577100,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Taoiseach.

That is an extraordinary number and it represents an increase from 221 million in 2010.  Clearly, migration is a significant and growing phenomenon.  It is important to remember that the vast majority of people move legally and in an orderly fashion.  All of the evidence demonstrates that safe, orderly, regular and freely chosen migration benefits countries of both origin and destination, as well as improving the lives of migrants.  Migration can also take place in an unsafe and irregular way, often because of hardship and persecution, as illustrated by recent tragedies and the continuing loss of life in the Mediterranean.  Conflict and persecution, as well as poverty, lack of opportunity and environmental degradation, continue to propel people to seek out opportunities for sanctuary and livelihoods elsewhere.  There are almost 71 million forcibly displaced persons globally.<\/p> <p> We support the European Council position that a comprehensive approach is essential.  Progress has been made, with the number of irregular border crossings into the European Union at its lowest in five years.  Challenges remain, however, and Ireland is working with its EU partners to resolve them and put in place sustainable solutions.  In 2015 Ireland committed to accepting up to 4,000 people through the EU relocation programme and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme.  Some 2,600 people have so far arrived in Ireland under these programmes.  Ireland has been active in search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean, with the Irish Naval Service having rescued more than 17,500 people there.  This year Ireland has agreed to receive up to 100 people disembarked following search and rescue operations as part of the refugee protection programme.  Ireland played a key role in the agreement at the United Nations last year of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees, both of which are important frameworks for international co-operation on migration and refugees.  <\/p> <p> My Department, through Ireland's international development programme, is also supporting efforts to address migration challenges.

As the T&aacute;naiste knows, Fine Gael's four MEPs voted against the resolution.

While the European Union has put in place mechanisms to deal with the increase in the number seeking asylum in the Union, not all member states have committed to sharing responsibility for addressing the matter.

This week I met representatives of a number of the NGOs that have been working to provide search and rescue support in the Mediterranean, saving people's lives.  The European Union needs to do more than it is doing.  Its inability to achieve a collective agreement on migration and the humanitarian response needed for migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean is not its finest hour.

After a general election in the UK, if the Parliament ratifies the latest withdrawal agreement that has been agreed between the British Government and the EU then, in all likelihood, the UK will leave the European Union at the end of January.

We are going to have to respond to these issues as they develop and, as ever, Brexit will not be easy and the European Union will have to make difficult choices, depending on the approach of the UK side.

Even the ratification process often takes longer than a year.  It is very ambitious for a British Prime Minister to expect that all of this can be done in ten or 11 months.

That organisation had been asked to look at the process by President Morales.  It concluded that it was unlikely that Mr. Morales had won by the required 10% margin and recommended that a new electoral commission be set up before convening fresh elections.<\/p>  <p>  On 10 November, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini issued a further statement, which Ireland supports.  The statement said that a new electoral court should be appointed that could offer guarantees of transparent elections.  It also called on all parties, particularly the authorities, to assume their democratic responsibilities and take the appropriate decisions to allow quick reconciliation and avoid further violence.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the latest reports from Bolivia that President Morales has now resigned his post in an effort to help restore stability.<\/p> <p>I understand he has accepted Mexico's offer of political asylum.  Developments in Bolivia are still unfolding and the situation remains unpredictable.  Following the announcement of the President's resignation on 10 November, there were reports of further demonstrations and looting across Bolivia.  A number of high-ranking officials, including the Vice President, the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the President of the Senate, have resigned.  According to the Bolivian Constitution, the next in line of authority is the Vice President of the Senate.  The Bolivian Constitution further provides that in the case of the President and Vice President both resigning, new elections must be held within 90 days.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to monitor developments closely.

Mr. Morales was the first indigenous leader of a South American country.  The Bolivian courts paved the way for him to run for a fourth term.

The escalation in the efforts of leaders of the opposition to overthrow him made it obvious that they were not interested in a second round of elections, or even in new elections.  Of course they have been aided by the military and the police.  This has led to suggestions that a military coup might have happened in Bolivia.  The Organization of American States, OAS, which found irregularities, has a chequered history.  It is dominated by the US and follows US policies.  It is based in Washington.  Previously, it facilitated and sanctioned the Cuban embargo.  There is no doubt that there is an anti-left wing bias in the organisation.  We know that Mr. Morales's departure has been welcomed by President Trump and President Bolsonaro.  The situation in Bolivia is very serious.  It is a question of where Bolivia goes now.

The team will focus on the verification of the vote count, including tally sheets, ballots and votes.

As the Deputy is aware, the question of a legally binding treaty to regulate the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises has been under consideration in Geneva by an open-ended intergovernmental working group for five years.  For further information on the general state of play on the prospects for such an instrument, I refer the Deputy to the response I gave to Deputy Shortall a few minutes ago.  As the proposed treaty covers matters for which the European Union is competent, it will be for the European Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Union and its member states.  I understand the matter will be on the agenda for the incoming Commission.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some civil society actors in Ireland have been very active in calling for Ireland to support the legally binding treaty and, in this context, have made specific recommendations for the adoption by both Ireland and the European Union of legislation on mandatory due diligence.  The need for due diligence mechanisms was considered in the development of Ireland's national plan on business and human rights which was launched at the end of 2017.  It identified existing provision in this area, for example, EU directives on environmental liability and non-financial reporting, and set out a number of action points to be taken forward by the business and human rights implementation group.<\/p>  <p>  Further research on the matter was undertaken in the context of the baseline assessment of the current legislative and regulatory framework for business and human rights in Ireland which was commissioned by my Department on foot of a key commitment given in the plan.

It has met three times this year and will meet again in January.  The chairperson is an extremely credible individual with considerable business experience.  While we are trying to move the agenda forward, it needs to happen at a global level through the United Nations.  I believe 16 EU countries have national plans, of about only 22 globally.  The European Union is engaged in this area, but it is really important that it be brought forward in the context of UN structures.  Otherwise the European Union will be doing things internally based on how it operates the Single Market and the regulatory environment.  Potentially the companies we are trying to target will leave the European Union and locate elsewhere because of the lack of regulation there.  This needs to happen in a way that will be benchmarked across the globe, as opposed to focusing on the European Union, but that does not mean that we cannot lead by example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200030#CC01000","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1573582500,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The implementation group has been rather quiet and I am not sure if some of the subgroups have even met.

The principal of St. Laurence's, Ms Clare Finnerty, told me that she met the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Bruton, in March 2017 and that she sent in a letter of application for a single school campus because the school is unusual in that it has two separate campuses.  The dual campus is unsatisfactory.  Infants are in Grange Road and 3rd to 6th classes are on Brookstone Road.  Her application was turned down, but she was encouraged to apply for upgrade works to both buildings.  She applied again for a single campus in 2018 and did not even receive an acknowledgement.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2018, the secretary of the senior school retired and the application for a replacement secretary was turned down.  There is no secretary now at one of the campuses.  In February 2018, the school made an emergency works application to replace doors that are necessary to create an internal corridor.  It is one of the old style schools from the 1960s or 1970s.  At present the children must leave the building to move into other classrooms.  The covered shelter area outside the building is also in serious need of repair and could be very dangerous if it collapsed.  This application was refused.  St. Laurence's representatives were then told by the Department that they should apply for emergency works but, again, this was refused in September.  they were then told that they should apply for a summer works grant to get fire alarms and electrics upgraded.  The principal was also told the school could apply for a minor works grant but the amount, &euro;13,600, is too small for the upgrading needed.  Why has the school not received approval for the single campus or for the urgent works that are necessary?<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the second issue, other Members and I were in touch with the principal and deputy principal of Our Lady Immaculate SNS Darndale, Dublin 17.  They were in contact with us first around the time of a shocking murder in broad daylight beside the junior national school in Darndale, which had a devastating effect on the community.  In fact, during the past school year there were two gun-related murders in close proximity to the school and as deputy principal, Shane Loftus, tells me, this had a serious impact on the children and on school life and teachers had to work closely with the children and parents to try to alleviate the impact of this utter mayhem happening outside their building. <\/p>  <p>  School staffing is based on figures from the previous school year and, in effect, staffing runs a year behind the number of children in the school.  I am told that in 2018-19, Our Lady Immaculate SNS had 180 children but had staffing for 193 based on numbers from 2017-18.  This year, however, the school will have 197 children but will only have staffing for 180 students. The case made by Shane Loftus and his colleagues on the school team is that the school will have one teacher fewer but will have more children to provide for.  The circumstances in that environment in the vicinity of the school are not remotely normal.  I was told that the smaller classes in the school meant teachers were able to provide a critical support to the children.  The school, the principal and deputy principal made the case that in these exceptional circumstances Our Lady Immaculate school should be allowed to maintain its current staffing level.  The numbers coming from the infants school in 2020-21 will increase.  We have had many discussions in this Chamber and I know the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, have visited the community.  The north Coolock community is facing an exceptionally difficult time on those grounds we want the Minister to grant the additional teacher that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200031#DD00500","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1573583100,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding these schools.  He covered a broad range of issues.  I acknowledge the recent difficulties faced by Our Lady Immaculate SNS in Darndale and the supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which launched a critical incident response, that included advice to the school in supporting the staff and students affected by the very unfortunate incident.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 marks the fourth year of a major investment in education.  It provided for an allocation of more than &euro;11 billion for my Departments in 2020.  This is the highest ever allocation to the sector and an increase of almost &euro;2 billion since 2016.  The numbers employed in our schools have reached the highest ever level.  More than 580 additional teaching posts will be funded to cater for children with special needs, the growth in our student population and supports to secure the future of small schools.  This builds on the budget 2018 measure, which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools to bring the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level, and budget 2019, which provided for more than 1,300 additional posts in schools.  Teacher numbers at primary level have increased by almost 3,500 when comparing the 2015-16 school year with the current school year and this has led to a steady improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size statistics during this period.  It was also announced in budget 2020 that an additional 1,064 special needs assistant, SNA, posts will be allocated to schools by December 2020, bringing the total number of SNAs available for allocation to more than 17,000.<\/p>  <p>  The key factor in determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  These criteria are available on my Department's website as part of the primary teacher allocation section.  Our Lady Immaculate SNS submitted an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board but the appeal was unsuccessful.  The school will be entitled to an additional mainstream class teacher in the 2020-21 school year based on its latest enrolment returns.  The primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  There is no change to the staffing of St. Laurence's national school in the current year and the school has not submitted an application for additional teaching staff to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  An Taoiseach recently met local stakeholders in the area, including the principal of Darndale senior school.  The meeting was attended by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, Deputy Sean Haughey and Senator Catherine Noone, and provided an opportunity to discuss a range of issues of importance locally.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department will invest &euro;8.4 billion in primary and post-primary school buildings.  This will include the provision of 50 large-scale school building projects and 20,000 additional school places in new buildings and extensions being delivered annually.  <\/p>  <p>  The summer works scheme is designed to allow schools to carry out small and medium scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.  The works are carried out by the schools themselves on a devolved basis mainly over the summer months.  There are no applications from the schools in question under this scheme.  In addition, the Department also provides an emergency works scheme, solely for unforeseen emergencies or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  Grant approval for mechanical repairs to Our Lady Immaculate SNSl was issued in September 2019 under this scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200031#DD00600","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1573583100,"counter":415,"content":"<p>The Minister has not given us any assistance on either issue.

We took the step of putting in place a just transition commissioner in order that we could fully explore the many issues that are being raised.  There are many opportunities coming from the communities.  There are assets available from the two companies.  I am determined that we will use this opportunity.  I recognise, as others have done, that just transition is not just for 2020.  It is a permanent part of our approach to carbon pricing.  We have committed as an Oireachtas to move to a carbon price of &euro;80 per tonne.  We have been very upfront and honest that all of this money will be ploughed back into helping people make this adjustment.  This involves a just transition for people uniquely exposed, as are the Bord na M&oacute;na workers and those working in the peat generation plants and, equally, people who are suffering from fuel poverty and people who need to make changes in their lifestyles.  We want to harness this opportunity and make the midlands a leading exemplar of how we can move to a low carbon economy.  This is, in part, what Bord na M&oacute;na is seeking to do in moving from brown to green.  It has a diversification plan.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to work through the issues.  Several Ministers felt the same sense of commitment that I do to make this work for the people of the midlands.  I appreciate the frustration and the questions that need answers.  We will work through and deliver those answers over the coming weeks and months and into the longer term.  We do recognise that it is a central part of the climate action plan to manage this transition in a fair way to people directly affected.  We will be committing to develop these ideas to the maximum extent possible.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200033#FF00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1573584300,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

There is a sum of &euro;20 million available and we will be mobilising the local authorities to be at the core in 2020.  Clearly it is something we want to build in in the coming period.  We have been admitted to the platform for coal regions in transition.  I know that the new Commission is interested in putting funding through it; therefore, it will be an opportunity for us.  I am open to suggestions on the terms of reference.  If the Deputies want to make suggestions, I will be happy to consider them.  We have tried to draw the terms in a broad fashion.  We are very confident that we will get permission for the repurposing of the PSO, but obviously we will have to have it signed.  We have done a lot of work in that regard and I am confident that we will deliver on it.  The peat regulations do require the companies to apply for substitute planning permission.  That is a requirement and it will have to be done.  Again, I believe the work we are doing in restoring bogs strengthens the case.<\/p>  <p>  On the other opportunities that are available, the ESB is the owner of the plant and has to evaluate its future.  Clearly, there are alternatives, as we move to a renewables base, to have alternative sources of fuel at the times the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine.  That is something the ESB will have to evaluate for the plant, as well as in its overall set.  I recognise that we need to create opportunities in the midlands.  Following the two particular announcements, there will be a concentration on working in the short term with those who have been impacted on most directly, certainly in providing for retraining and opportunities to switch to the new employment opportunities we are developing.  To build that bridge, we will have to concentrate, in particular, on the areas where workers who have been directly affected are located.  Of course, a just transition is something we will continue to pursue.  I recognise the wider impact in the midlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200034#GG00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network Expansion","time":1573584900,"counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200034#GG00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1573584900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for including this item and the Minister, Deputy Ross, for taking the time to come to respond.  <\/p>  <p>  Like so many commuting families, particularly in the greater Dublin area but also in the larger urban centres, I despair.  We all are aware of the lady who tweeted about standing and watching eight trams pass by and the fact that when one did stop, she would have required assistance to push her in to a tram to allow her to get on and make her journey.  We do not need to remind anybody because he or she is suffering twice daily for five days a week the commute misery.<\/p>  <p>  Over the weekend, to my amazement, when I was looking at the eTenders website, I read the following: \"Irish Rail has a requirement for a transport and economic consultancy to prepare a robust and comparable detailed business case for DART expansion for submission to Government for securing capital expenditure approval\".  Hello.  Do we need a business case to prove and underpin the fact that there is a need for additional rail capacity?  We are throwing good money after bad in going to eTenders to have some third party bill us for a couple of hundred grand or more to do this job.  What is more, when this was first mooted on 18 July 2013, the then CEO of Irish Rail announced and sought the committee's support for this wonderful proposal for DART expansion.  Later, on 9 December 2014, in responding to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, the Minister for Finance gave further assurances about this great plan.  On 18 May 2016 he Minister, Deputy Ross, our newly appointed saviour from the public transportation nightmare, gave detailed information to Deputy Lawless on the great expansion.  In that debate he made reference to July 2015 and something being based on the outcome of the updated business case, presumably the second one.  The call on eTenders for the making a third business case was made last Friday and it will be received in one month.  When it comes in at whatever cost, however long it will take, will we have a fourth updated business case?<\/p>  <p>  The stones on the road know.  Is there a total absence of common sense that we have to throw good money after bad?  Is the Minister honestly telling me that, given the competence and capacity of its expert team, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is not capable of putting a business case together?  If it is not, what about the National Transport Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland?  If they are not capable of doing so, what about the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?<\/p>  <p>  While the Minister is between photo calls with sport stars at Dublin Airport and given that the festive season is fast approaching - no doubt the Santa hat will be donned once again for photo calls outside Stepaside Garda station - people are suffering commute misery on a daily basis and we continue to have promises about great ideas in respect of what we are doing.  At his press briefing to announce the construction of the Adare bypass, a project which has yet to proceed to planning, the Minister was also telling people once again about the greater Dublin area and DART expansion.  It is great to know that following the making of a business case, the great idea the NTA described, and the making of an updated business case in July 2015, tenders are being sought for a further business case.

I can assure him that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority, NTA, have my full support as they seek to improve capacity and increase services on the rail network.  That support is evidenced by the increased funding made available in recent years and the increased investment planned in the coming years.  Equally, I assume I have the Deputy's full support and that of everyone in the House in ensuring that proposals to spend massive amounts of money are properly considered.  Nobody should consider it to be a burden, as the Deputy has alleged.  It is instead a duty on all of us, as public representatives, to ensure the taxpayer is protected.  I agree that scrutiny and oversight must be proportionate.  However, it must occur.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, as the Deputy probably knows, I have secured Government approval for the development a new national train control centre and the purchase of 41 additional rail carriages for the greater Dublin area.  Together, that represents an investment of approximately &euro;285 million in the rail network and is no doubt welcomed by everyone in this House who is worried about commuters, as I know the Deputy genuinely is, as coming from where he is he has reason to be so worried.<\/p>  <p>  Individually, each of those projects costs over &euro;100 million and therefore each was, of course, subject to scrutiny in line with the requirements of the public spending code.  Let me assure the Deputy that there was no undue delay or administrative burden associated with either project.  Nor will I apologise for ensuring appropriate oversight of hundreds of millions of euro, or indeed apologise for complying with Government guidelines.  In the coming years Project Ireland 2040 commits billions of euro towards sustainable mobility.  I can assure the taxpayer that my Department takes its responsibilities with regard to the oversight of expenditure very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  Given the sums of money involved, I would expect all of us in the House to take those responsibilities seriously too.  I will shortly seek Government approval for a &euro;1 billion investment in our heavy rail network over the next five years.  This investment programme will deliver better journey times, improved reliability and continued safety across the network.  It represents an approximate 40% increase in funding as compared to the last five year programme over 2014 to 2018 and is hugely significant. <\/p>  <p>  Next year I expect to receive a business case in relation to what the Deputy refers to as the DART expansion programme, which is a multi-billion euro programme, to increase massively the rail network and services across the greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  Each of these investment programmes will be properly assessed.  That is required under the public spending code, but importantly it is also the right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  On the most recent decision to expand the commuter rail fleet in the greater Dublin area, the Deputy may wish to be aware that the business case was originally submitted at the end of August, with a final version submitted on 24 September and Government approval secured on 30 October.  There no undue delay nor was there any unnecessary administrative burden.  I welcome the fact these new carriages are on their way and I look forward to their entry into service.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the commuter misery crisis, which continues to deteriorate.  I have listed some of the things that the Government is doing in the short, medium and long term to relieve a critical situation, which we all agree is not entirely satisfactory.  It is being seriously tackled and I do not want to trivialise it in anyway in this House this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200035#HH00100","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1573585500,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I do not want to trivialise this matter either.  None of this debate is personal.  I learned this from the master in the Seanad.  He would not tolerate this kind of response in those days and I certainly cannot tolerate it today.  The Minister's new-found interest in value-for-money is admirable, but how many business cases does one need?  Who is prepared to take a decision and back the facts and say, look, the issue is clear, a blind man can see and experience the compute misery of all of us.  We are kicking it around the administrative merry-go-round time and again.  What it boils down to is that Ministers have become non-executive directors.  They turn up at the ceremonial occasions to say a few words, to cut the tape and be in the photograph but when it comes to running the country, it is on e-tenders.  The Minister was referring to a business case on such a date.  Which one is he referring to?  Was that the one three years ago, the updated one, or is it the one that has not been replied to yet because the closing date is not until 9 December at 12 o'clock?<\/p>  <p>  We have had this with the ordering of carriages too, with these 41 mythical characters.  The Minister must be expecting the polar express to pull into town over Christmas because the reality is that I do not even know if the 41 have been ordered yet.  There are 60 to 80 used ones to be leased and are supposedly to be arriving next February and I have not heard much about that lately.  It must have run aground too.<\/p>  <p>  We are back to value-for-money and the business case.  We need a third business case.  Is it third time lucky?  Do we need three business cases before we take a decision to do what any five-eight person knows needs to be done?  We need to expand this.  Have we not got the money?  Who is taking the decision?  Why is he putting this out to tender?  How much will that cost?  That is more money wasted that could be much-better spent elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to value-for-money, I apologise and I know this will annoy the Minister, but I have to give him the kick on this.  I do not remember the business case on Stepaside Garda station when I was down at the Committee of Public Accounts, as the assistant commissioner responsible for Dublin said, no, that was not a priority for them.  Other matters are.  We know that we are coming into the season when the Santa hat will be donned and the Minister will be waving to the traffic with the lights turned on in Stepaside.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, those people getting the bus, if they manage to get stuffed on and have enough assistance to get pushed into it, will now leave it to the Minister.  We are going to get value-for-money and in 100 years time we may have a public transportation system that we deserve, when we have people who are prepared to take decisions, based on the facts rather than being put around the administrative merry-go-round with no solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200035#HH00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1573585500,"counter":439,"content":"<p>The train needs to leave the station.

I am very keen that the commuters of the entire country, including the commuters in Deputy MacSharry's constituency, are listened to and catered for.  One of the things that has happened here, and I am sure Deputy will admit this as well, is that the rail network is a victim of its own success.  The numbers pouring onto the rail network are absolutely phenomenal and the increases are likely to continue.  I have to attempt to meet current and to anticipate future demands.  The idea that anybody has sat on his or her hands or has been ignoring this problem is completely and utterly untrue.  The NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have been working on options to increase capacity, both in terms of service improvements introduced and in exploring the best way to increase fleet size.<\/p>  <p>  One option was to refurbish the older fleet and bring them back into service.  That option was actively explored until the costs come back.  Deputy MacSharry is very genuinely and sincerely concerned about costs.  These costs came back at about three times the estimate.  People advocating this option as the panacea need to reflect on whether they think that spending two thirds of the cost of a new fleet on carriages with around one third of their lifespan is good use of taxpayers' money.  It obviously is not.<\/p>  <p>  Another option was to consider whether to buy or lease second-hand fleet.  That option was similarly explored but it was ultimately not the best option, either due to things like uncertainty around availability, costs, age etc.<\/p>  <p>  At the very end of the summer, a business case was presented to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on what is the preferred option, to which Deputy MacSharry also referred, which was buying 41 additional carriages.

On the fleet, I have brought a memorandum to Government on the business case for the purchase of 41 additional intercity railcars.

The Ceann Comhairle is like Speedy Gonzales this evening.<\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the implementation of the social protection measures contained in budget 2020.  The House will be aware that the budget was necessarily an exercise in prudent management of the public finances given the risks that Brexit poses to our economy.  I hope Deputies will appreciate that, as a consequence, the scope for increasing welfare rates was limited.  That does not mean, however, that we can fail to be innovative in ensuring available resources are used to effect the best possible changes for society.  I am pleased we have provided for measures that will offer support to those who are reliant entirely on the support of the State, and that these measures will improve the lot of as many families and vulnerable people as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The social welfare budget package for 2020, of &euro;212 billion, includes &euro;171.2 million in additional social welfare expenditure that specifically targets those most in need.  More than 200,000 older people and people with a disability living alone will receive increased payments, with an increase of &euro;5 per week to their living alone allowance payment.  An important change in this budget is that increases to the weekly payments will take effect during the week beginning 6 January 2020 rather than the end of March, as had been the case in recent years.  The increases to the living alone allowance, for example, will take effect from the week beginning 6 January 2020, benefiting more than 160,000 pensioners and 40,000 people with disabilities who are living alone.  From the week beginning 6 January 2020, those receiving weekly social welfare payments with dependent children will get an increase.  Families with children aged 12 and over will receive a weekly increase of &euro;3 for each child, and those with children under 12 will get a weekly increase of &euro;2 for each child.  This builds on the increases introduced in last year's budget and the change I introduced in last year's budget legislation to provide higher rates of support for older children.<\/p>  <p>  Working lone parents will see the earnings disregard increase by &euro;15 to &euro;165 per week from January, allowing them to earn more without affecting their one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transition payment.  There will be an increase in the income thresholds for the working family payment of &euro;10 per week for families with up to three children, ensuring that more low-income families qualify for the payment.  It ensures that the families availing of this employment support will benefit from an additional &euro;6 per week.<\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers aged 25 will receive an increase of &euro;45.20 in their weekly payment from January, bringing them up to the maximum rate payable, thereby discontinuing the reduced payment currently in place for 25 year old jobseekers.  The jobseeker's allowance payment made to jobseekers who are under 25 will be increased to the maximum rate where they are living independently and in receipt of State housing support, for example, rent supplement or any of our housing assistance payments.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the measures contained in the budget do not require primary legislation and, therefore, are not reflected in the Bill.  These include an increase in the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week to &euro;24.50 from January; extending the household benefits package, that is, the gas and electricity allowance and free TV licence, to people under 70 who have another adult living with them; &euro;2.5 million that is being provided specifically to target job activation and training supports for groups who are most distant from the labour market or have challenges entering the workforce; the extension of the hot school meals programme; an increase in the number of hours for which a carer can work per week from 15 to 18.5; funding for important research into a question that has exercised most Deputies, namely, how best to address difficult issues around maintenance payments; and an increase in the earnings disregard for those in receipt of the jobseeker's transition payment.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to have received Government approval for the payment of the social welfare Christmas bonus at a rate of 100% again this year.  It will be paid in early December.  It will benefit all recipients of long-term payments, including carers, those with disabilities, pensioners and lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the contents of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, its construction and citations, and its commencement provisions.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 provides for definitions of terms used in Part 2, which relates to amendments to the Social Welfare Acts.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 is a technical amendment that brings the definition of \"confinement\" for maternity benefit purposes into line with the definition used in the Civil Registration Acts.<\/p> <p>Up to this point, a mother can qualify for maternity benefit once the child has attained a gestational age of 24 weeks.  By bringing the definitions into line with each other, we will ensure that where a child is unfortunately stillborn and has a birth weight of 500 g, the mother will qualify for maternity benefit irrespective of the child's gestational age.  While this is a very small change, it is a very important one for the mothers who are already dealing with a very difficult situation.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides that the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance for claimants aged 18 to 24 will no longer apply where the claimant lives independently and is in receipt of housing supports.  The full rate of jobseeker's allowance will be paid to these persons with effect from 1 January 2020.  Section 5 provides that, from 1 January 2020, the age-related reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance will no longer apply to younger claimants once they have attained the age of 25.<\/p> <p> Section 6 is a technical amendment and updates the legislative provisions governing entitlement to carer's allowance.  The amendment confirms that the definition of a \"relevant person\", that is, a person who requires full-time care and attention, means, in the case of a person aged under 16, a person in respect of whom a domiciliary care allowance is in payment.<\/p> <p> Sections 7 and 8 mirror the amendments in sections 4 and 5 by providing that the age-related rates of supplementary welfare allowance will no longer apply where the claimant lives independently and is in receipt of housing supports and that age-related rates generally will no longer apply to those who attain the age of 25.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income thresholds which determine the level of working family payment for families with up to three children.  This change will take effect from 9 January 2020.  Section 10 is a technical amendment to make it absolutely clear in the legislation that the payment of guardian's payment to a guardian in respect of an orphan does not affect the right of the guardian to claim welfare payments in his or her own right.<\/p> <p> Section 11 is a technical amendment which updates section 247 of the Act to set out the payments which may not be paid concurrently with the working family payment.  Section 12 is another technical amendment which brings the legislative provisions relating to social welfare payments after the death of a claimant fully into line with long-standing policy and practice.  In particular, it makes it clear that such payments are made to the surviving spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the deceased.<\/p> <p> Section 13 provides for the repeal of section 282 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which currently provides for reduced cost life event, namely, birth, marriage or death certificates.  This is a matter which is more appropriately dealt with under civil registration law and equivalent provisions in the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 will be commenced in parallel with this repeal.  The provisions will allow regulations to be made by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the purpose of setting the fees, if any, for the provision of life event certificates.<\/p> <p> Section 14 provides for amendments to the provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act relating to the recovery of certain benefits where a compensator, typically an insurance company, is also paying compensation in respect of the same injury, accident or disease that gave rise to the claim for a social welfare payment in the first instance.  First, it adds supplementary welfare allowance to the list of specified benefits which may be recovered and second, it adjusts the period within which a request for a statement of recoverable benefits must be issued to a compensator from four weeks to 25 working days.<\/p> <p> Sections 15 and 19 are perhaps the most important sections of the Bill, since they provide for a &euro;2 increase in the rate of the qualified child increase for children aged under 12, from &euro;34 to &euro;36 per week, and an increase of &euro;3, from &euro;37 to &euro;40 per week for children aged 12 and over.  These sections also provide for an increase of &euro;5 per week in the rate of the living alone allowance.  Depending on the scheme involved, these measures come into effect on dates between 1 and 10 January 2020.<\/p> <p> Section 16 provides that the blind welfare allowance, a payment that is currently made by the HSE, will be disregarded in the means test for certain social assistance payments, and in particular for disability allowance payment.  This measure comes into effect from 10 January 2020.  Section 17 provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payment from &euro;150 to &euro;165 per week, with effect from 9 January 2020.<\/p> <p> Section 18 is another technical amendment which updates references set out in the means-testing provisions contained in table 2 of Schedule 3 to reflect both changes in structures, for instance with the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and changes in practices, by recognising that certain payments may be made by agencies contracted by the HSE, as well as being made directly by the HSE itself.<\/p> <p> Part 3 provides for amendments to the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the National Training Fund Act 2000.  First, section 20 amends section 10D of the National Minimum Wage Act to provide that, where the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission has not been implemented, the Minister of the day may nonetheless subsequently issue an order.  This amendment is designed to cater for situations such as the current uncertainty surrounding the timing and effects of Brexit.  Second, the final section of the Bill, section 21, provides for a 0.1% increase from 0.9% to 1% in the National Training Fund levy payable by employers in respect of reckonable earnings of employees in class A and class H employments with effect from 1 January 2020.<\/p> <p> Finally, I wish to advise the House that I intend to bring forward amendments to address issues raised in a Supreme Court judgment which found that provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act relating to the entitlements of prisoners were unconstitutional.  To put it simply, the court has found that the automatic disallowance of entitlement to benefits for prisoners is unconstitutional since it represents a secondary or extrajudicial punishment.  Again, the issues involved are quite complex but need to be addressed.  Work is under way at present on drafting the necessary changes to the Act and, if they are ready, I hope to introduce them as amendments to the Bill.<\/p> <p> I wish to re-emphasise that the Bill before us today demonstrates our commitment to providing a better deal for families, as reflected in particular in the increased rates of payment for qualified children and the enhancement of the working family payment and the one-parent family payment.  We have also paid particular attention to older people living alone.  Even in the context of a budget which had to be constrained due to the potential consequences of Brexit, I hope we have built on the significant increases of recent years and maintained the focus on the groups in society who are at most risk and are most vulnerable.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200036#JJ01200","speaker":"1338","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573586700,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Curran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200037#KK00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1573586700,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We will not vote it down and plunge the country into a pre-Christmas election, which I am sure nobody would want, but neither am I a great fan of the deal negotiated under the confidence and supply agreement.  However, even since the budget was negotiated, the parameters in regard to Brexit have shifted.  I will come back to that in a moment.<\/p>  <p>  According to Social Justice Ireland, the budget and the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, which is an integral part of the budget, \"betrays the vulnerable\".  That is a pretty damning indictment but, as I understand the budget and the Bill, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that Social Justice Ireland is in fact correct because the budget both increases poverty and increases inequality.  I read an analysis recently from a Mr. Michael Taft of SIPTU, who said that taking the headline figure of inflation into account, in order to just stand still pensioners would need to get &euro;168 per annum on a projected 1.3% rate of inflation.<\/p>  <p>  That is bad enough if it told the full story but of course it does not.  I made the point time and again that for people who are just living from week to week and existing on the basic necessities of life, inflation runs at two or three times the headline rate of inflation.  I will give an example.  Across all social strata in this country, the average household spends approximately 14.5% of its budget on food but the lowest 40% of the population, the four lower deciles, in income terms, the figure shoots up to 20%, which means that increases in food prices bear down hardest on those least able to afford them.  The same can be said of other basic necessities such as the cost of heating, public transport and other such expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  I did make a statement in advance of the budget that I did not know how certain people occupying certain positions could accept a &euro;1,700 increase, while at the same time we were providing nothing for social welfare recipients.  That did not make me particularly popular among my colleagues.<\/p> <p>I should probably not have singled out Deputies because they are part of a group subject to the national wage negotiations within the Civil Service, but they are not the highest paid group.  Many said to me that when tax, PRSI etc. are taken into account, the actual net rise only compensates them for inflation, but at least they are being compensated.  If one looks at the trajectory of wage rises in the private sector, it is different, though not in the entirety of the private sector since it is a very diverse sector.  Some of the wage rises in the private sector more than adequately compensate people for inflation.  The reality is that if somebody is on &euro;100,000 a year and one gives that person a pay increase of &euro;2,000 per annum, while somebody else is on &euro;203 per week and receives a pay increase of &euro;5 per week, one is increasing inequality.  If one gives the guy on a &euro;100,000 salary an extra &euro;2,000, with nothing for the guy on &euro;203 per week, one increases inequality even further.  The net result of that is that vulnerable people will see their standard of living drop and they will fall even further behind the rest of society.  Speaking for myself, I see no justification for this.  It is not only unfair, but it fatally undermines social cohesion in the country.<br\/><br\/>One in every six people, some 760,000 people in the country, live below the poverty line.  The majority of those who are welfare recipients will now live in even greater poverty because welfare increases have failed to keep pace with increases elsewhere in the economy.  An analysis of the budgetary figures has shown that the least was given to welfare-dependent households and those on the lowest earnings.  That is hardly something to be proud of.  The Minister has included a section in this Bill to enable her to increase the minimum wage by order when she deems the circumstances justify that.  Will she clarify whether she intends to do that from 1 January 2020, when the Brexit situation will be much clearer?  The parameters of Brexit have shifted and it is almost certain that we have managed to avoid the nightmare scenario of a no-deal Brexit, as the Minister will be aware.  If it is the Minister's intention to do that, will she take the opportunity at the same time to compensate other people who have lost out as a result of the fear of a no-deal Brexit, such as pensioners who do not live alone, people forced to live on disability income, single parents among whom poverty is rampant, and carers?<br\/><br\/>Another example of something that I fundamentally disagree with is the Minister's usage of an increase in the fuel allowance as the exclusive method by which increases in the carbon tax will be offset for the most vulnerable.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there are many vulnerable sections of society which do not get fuel allowance, including jobseekers, carers, people on illness benefit and single parents.  In a response here in this House to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me that the Government had carefully worked out that &euro;28 multiplied by two, which is &euro;56, was the appropriate sum to compensate for the budgetary increase in the carbon tax.  If that is the case, why was the &euro;56 not extended to people who do not qualify for the carer's allowance.  The stated reason for all of this is the danger of a no-deal Brexit.  It is ironic that the country that is going to leave the European Union is now having a general election and the two parties competing for power in it are offering to spend money that would put an alcoholic sailor on shore leave for a day to shame.  Trillions are being mentioned in the country that is exiting the European Union, and we cannot afford &euro;5 for people on social welfare.<br\/><br\/>The latest CSO statistics indicate that approximately one child in five in this country, that is, 230,000 children, lives in a household below the poverty line.  The figure has remained virtually static for some time now.  The budget contains some alleviation measures but they only scratch the surface.  The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020, sets out a target of taking children out of poverty by 2020.  That now looks like an impossible dream.<br\/><br\/>With regard to disability, the Minister will recall that in last year's budget, work was commissioned on a cost of disability allowance.  The question was how much it would cost to enable a person who could not work because of disability to live like a person who did not have a disability.  What has happened to that?  Have conclusions been reached?  Has a report been sent to Cabinet?  Why commission work on something such as this if there is no intention to follow through?  The motorised transport grant, an essential aid to people with disabilities, has now been suspended for six years.  I have asked on numerous occasions here when it is going to return.  I was told that it was all so complicated that the whole Civil Service seemed to be working on it at one stage.  What is so complicated about it?  When it was suspended in 2013, people who already qualified were left <i>in situ<\/i>but tens of thousands of people must have qualified in the meantime under the previous criteria.  Now they are trying to exist side by side with people who are actually getting the mobility grant.  That is most unfair.  It also is unfair that the Citizens Information Act 2007 provided for the establishment of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities which has not yet been brought into force.<br\/><br\/>The Minister recently told us that we would need a conversation about carers and I agree with that.  One in 20 people in the country are now carers.  It will be one in five within the next ten to 15 years, a startling escalation.  The Minister will also be aware that three quarters of people who spend their lives caring for a loved one do not qualify for any carer's allowance.  That is a reality.  The Minister got a request from representatives of the Carers Association to increase the number of hours that they can work from 15 to 18.5.  A natural assumption was attached to that that if one increases the number of hours somebody can work, one thereby proportionately increases the amount a person can earn.  It makes no sense otherwise.  The Minister responded by saying that if she increased the means test for the amount that people could earn by the requested amount, this would cost a phenomenal sum of money.  We are talking about two different things here.  When one increases the number of hours that a person can work, surely it logically follows that the amount that person could earn increases.<br\/><br\/>The Minister will also be aware of a submission from Carers Ireland relating to tackling the postcode lottery for caring around the country.  It made a detailed submission that involved some rebalancing of existing resources and approximately &euro;3 million in extra expenditure.  That would have put an end to the situation where the amount of access one has to the services provided by the State and these caring associations would not depend on where one lived.  That is right and proper.  Yet we are told that the expenditure of an extra &euro;3 million would compromise the country's ability to deal with a no-deal Brexit.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the slight increase in the earnings disregard for single parents, but if one looks at the poverty levels among single parents, how many single parents will this take out of poverty between now and next year?  We recently passed a motion in the House, tabled by Deputy Brady, to the effect that there should be an agency to pursue the putative parent rather than have people traipsing through the District Court, with all that it entails.  We have been talking about this for quite a long time and there is no sign of any action.<br\/><br\/>We congratulated ourselves after the last change of Government, saying that we had moved from regressive budgets to progressive budgets.  I think we are back to regressive budgets again.  I heard a Government spokesman and others telling people on social welfare that, in view of the danger of a no-deal Brexit, the Government would have to be pragmatic.<\/p> <p>\"Pragmatic\", of course, is a Merrion Street code word for \"Go to the back of the queue\".  Only a short time ago we had the then Minister for Social Protection, now Taoiseach, launching his social welfare cheats campaign, which lumped all welfare recipients together and labelled them as potential cheats and scroungers.  The image that some commentators want people to conjure up every time we mention welfare increases is that of a slovenly, workshy man or woman sitting on a couch, watching horse racing or the soaps on a big plasma television and milking the system for all it is worth.  I can assure the Minister the reality is very different.  The people we are talking about are those who just get by from week to week, dreading the next bill or the next family occasion, which more often than not they will have to avoid because they cannot afford to go.  Their benefits are spent on the basic necessities of life, even before they are received.<\/p> <p> If we are to grow and develop as a cohesive and compassionate society, rather than a collection of competing economic interests, surely we must put those in need by virtue of their health, age, disability or other circumstances at the top of the queue when it comes to sharing out the fruits of economic growth.  To do otherwise is not just reckless and irresponsible, it is unjust and unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200037#KK00400","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573587900,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which gives legislative effect to the budget changes.  As the Minister rightly said, some of the changes that were made and announced in budget 2020 do not require legislation.  I would like to acknowledge a change the Minister has made that I have been asking to be made for a long time, namely, bringing the date of social welfare changes back to January.  While this may be limited, it is important.  I have always felt that the people of this nation should be treated equally and if we are making taxation changes and social welfare changes they should happen at the same time.  While it might only appear a small thing, the policy direction and the change is to be welcomed and acknowledged.  I have long been of the view it is unfair to treat people differently.<\/p>  <p>  That said, I am disappointed that, across a range of social welfare payments for pensioner couples, carers and people with disabilities, we are not seeing an annual increase.  In a time of inflation, they will be worse off and, as Deputy O'Dea said, that cost of living inflation will affect people differently.  It is worth noting the Minister has held open the option of increasing the national minimum wage sometime next year without reference to this legislation as it is a piece of work she can do outside the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It has constantly been stated that the reason the annual increase was not affordable this year was the context of Brexit, in particular a no-deal Brexit or a hard Brexit, and the impact it would have on the economy.  While the budget was framed in such a way, and this Bill is giving effect to the budget, I cannot understand why the door was not left open to review the social welfare budget early in the new year following the Brexit deal.  If there is a Brexit that is not a hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, why can we not revisit the core social welfare payments?  That would have been the prudent thing to do.  Most workers next year will receive some sort of increase.  Whether through the minimum wage, through existing agreements or through existing public service agreements, most workers are going to receive some type of pay increase next year but many people who are totally or partially dependent on social welfare, unfortunately, will not.  As I said at the outset, the people of this nation should be treated fairly and equally and that does not seem to be happening in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  I want to refer to particular increases.  I have spoken before on the issue of the carer's allowance, in particular means testing.  I want to refer briefly to a note I received from a lady.  Her family moved into the Palmerstown area four years ago and they adapted their house without grants.  Their daughter, who is eight, has a rare neurological condition which is life-limiting.  Her daily struggles are that she is blind, she has very poor muscle tone, she is tube-fed and she has uncontrolled epilepsy.  The mother is her full-time carer but is not able to receive carer's allowance because the husband is working.  I have made this point before.  Despite the fact he is working, they are not well-off because they are paying a mortgage and they are struggling to make ends meet.  We need to review urgently the carer's allowance scheme in regard to people who find themselves in real need of financial support in very serious cases.  The system is not adequate and does not take into account housing costs, whether mortgage or rent, which is a big deficiency of the scheme.  The Minister may argue the whole scheme needs to be reviewed but if it is not taking account of cost of living in terms of rent or mortgage, it is missing the point.  We are all seeing such people but I wanted to refer to that particular case.  I ask the Minister that this be done urgently.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the fuel allowance.  One of the issues that has arisen and was brought to my attention is that, for many people who qualify and have the correct social welfare payment, they can only have excess income of &euro;100 a year.  How long has it been &euro;100?  The point people are making to me is that the savings they would have had a number of years ago have now grown and the &euro;100 excess over the social welfare payment threshold means they are missing out on fuel allowance because they are a few euro over the &euro;100.  When was the &euro;100 last index-linked and measured against inflation in order to treat people fairly, whether it is in terms of the capital or earned income they can have?  There is no use saying that one side of the equation is going up.  I have come across individuals who have crossed that threshold of &euro;100 - they actually exist and it is not fiction or a myth.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment the Minister on one issue which came before the Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, namely, young people on jobseeker's allowance, in particular young people who are not living in the home.  If young persons aged 18, 19 or 20 are not living in the home, it is generally for a very good reason and they need those supports.  I am glad that, in this budget, jobseeker's allowance has been amended to treat them fairly.  They have come from challenging backgrounds and find themselves not capable of living in the family home.  Most 19 or 20 year olds would not just opt to leave and there are generally circumstances that make that happen.  I am glad to see that change made in this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200039#MM00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1573587900,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and acknowledge the importance of its speedy passage through the Houses due to the increases contained in it.  For that reason, we will be not be objecting to it today but we fully intend to submit numerous amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to say that social welfare increases are only welcomed by recipients and by stakeholders because the payment is so inadequate in the first place.  By increasing certain payments by &euro;2, &euro;3 or &euro;5, the Minister is not making social welfare payments adequate, nor are the increases based on evidence of any kind.  To quote Social Justice Ireland, this budget betrays the vulnerable as many are left further behind.  We should be working towards making all social welfare supports adequate for those who rely on them and we should be moving to an evidence-based approach.  Instead, every single year, we have a political football around social welfare rates.  Prior to this budget, Fianna F&aacute;il was demanding a &euro;5 increase for old-age pensioners but it quietly moved away from that when it failed to achieve it.  Every year we see the furore about whether people in receipt of social welfare will get a fiver.  Fine Gael announces it and Fianna F&aacute;il likes to take credit when it is given but remains silent when it is not.  This is no way to treat pensioners, lone parents, low income households and persons with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward a fully costed and workable solution, a social welfare commission.<\/p>  <p>This would use evidence, including the minimum essential standard of living as set out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, to make recommendations to Government on social welfare rates annually ahead of the budget.  This work would be done on the basis that different households have different needs and that social welfare rates must, therefore, be adequate to meet various household needs.  This would protect the most vulnerable households from poverty and ensure that social welfare rates are adequate, putting an end to people being left hoping for a fiver every year when the budget comes around.  I also appeal to the Minister to consider that linking social welfare rates to the consumer price index, CPI, or to average industrial earnings will not ensure adequacy, but adequacy is what is needed.  Stakeholders made this clear to her at the annual pre-budget forum.  She needs to listen to all the stakeholders supporting this important work.<\/p> <p> Section 4 relates to young jobseekers and the changes to their payment rates.  For years, the Minister and her Government have ignored the impact reduced rates of payment have had on our young jobseekers aged between 18 and 25.  This was started by Fianna F&aacute;il, which of late has seemingly seen the error of its ways and is now calling for a change to that.  It is glaringly obvious that living on &euro;100 per week will lead to major difficulties for someone with no job.  This was a dangerous cut made by Fianna F&aacute;il and followed by Fine Gael in government.  This Bill does not fix it; instead it replaces an age condition with a living condition.  Those aged between 18 and 24 will have their payments increased to the full rate if they live independently and are in receipt of State housing support.  How many people living on &euro;112.70 per week could afford to live independently?  The number is 300 people, leaving more than 14,000 young jobseekers on &euro;112.70 per week.  The increase provided for in the Bill will, therefore, benefit the smallest number of jobseekers possible.  Perhaps the findings of the report into the impact of reduced jobseeker rates, overdue since mid-2016, is what opened the Minister's eyes to the reality for young jobseekers.  We cannot say that for sure, however, because over three years later we have not seen that report.  It has been hidden away and has not seen the light of day.  I again call on the Minister to publish the report immediately.  All jobseekers, regardless of age or living arrangements, should receive the same rate.  The discrimination based on age needs to come to an end.<\/p> <p> A number of changes in the Bill will be of some small benefit to lone parents, but that is simply not enough.  According to the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, lone parents are in deep income inadequacy.  Lone parent families are five times more likely to live in consistent poverty than households headed by two adults.  The changes the Minister's party, along with the Labour Party, made to the one-parent family payment made life harder for lone parent families.  That was the conclusion of Indecon in its examination of the changes.  In this State both parents are legally obliged to maintain their children yet there are no consequences for those who do not, nor are lone parents assisted in seeking child maintenance.  Over and over again, lone parent families are failed by the State.  Why do we put it on lone parents to seek maintenance from the other parent?  Why do we force lone parents into courtrooms to seek maintenance from a judge?  Why does the State fail to act when maintenance is granted and court ordered but not paid?  When it comes to child maintenance, which is proven in every country in which it is paid to play a massive role in reducing poverty, why does the Government choose to chase the non-custodial parent to cover its own costs in paying the one-parent family payment but have no involvement in seeking or guaranteeing the payment of maintenance?  I seek clarity on the Minister's intentions in respect of the judge-led group she is establishing.  Is it being established with the aim of setting guidelines or setting up a statutory child maintenance service, which is what lone parents are looking for?  Will the stakeholders be heard on this?  It is critical that they are.  We have, again, brought forward the solution to this twice - in our published proposals and in a recent motion passed by the House.<\/p> <p> I refer to the omission of provisions to address a lacuna in statute that excludes married same-sex male adopters from accessing 24 weeks' adoptive leave, which the Government has consistently stated it will address since 2016.  The lack of adoptive leave for men is a major obstacle to their being able to adopt.  We should not limit adoption for parents who are fit and capable of providing care.  Given that this is the only family type omitted from the Bill, we should address it purely based on the discriminatory element the current law upholds.  Given its recent omission from the Parent's Leave and Benefits Act 2019, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, stated he would address it in this Bill, yet it seems to be missing from the legislation again.  While I am aware that the Minister of State has been in contact with parents stating that amendments are still being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, can the Minister indicate when she believes she will be able to include this in the Bill?  Given her previous dealings with the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and the difficulties the delays caused and are still causing, and given how proactive she was in addressing her remit in that regard, I hope she will continue that proactivity in dealing with this issue.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties described the exclusion of male same-sex adoptive couples from the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act as an unacceptable and unjustifiable form of discrimination against them.  This discrimination is happening on the Minister's watch.  Will she commit to include the necessary amendment to this legislation on Committee Stage to right once and for all this wrong?<\/p> <p> The &euro;2 increase in the fuel allowance fails to deal even with the rate of inflation, let alone the carbon tax hike that will be imposed on citizens throughout the State.  I tabled an amendment in this regard to last year's Social Welfare Bill because I firmly believe that the fuel allowance could, and should, be used as a means to help people out of fuel poverty, which is gripping too many of our citizens.  Year after year I stand up here to cite examples of some of our most vulnerable citizens having to sit in State premises and buildings and on trains, using their free bus passes, simply and purely to keep warm.  This &euro;2 increase is a slap in the face to those citizens, given the massive hike in the carbon tax.  The Minister needs to commit to work on the issue of fuel poverty, which I have raised consistently, with a view to using the fuel allowance as a means of lifting our citizens out of fuel poverty.<\/p> <p> Regarding the National Training Fund, a 0.1% increase in employer levy is included in the legislation, yet money is still sitting in that fund unspent.  If the Minister is to keep increasing the amount being paid in, at the very least the money should be spent on what the fund was set up to do.<\/p> <p>We know from the reply to a parliamentary question asked by my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, that between 2015 and 2018, &euro;299 million had been collected but not spent, while the projected underspend in 2019 alone is a further &euro;199 million.  This is absolute madness.  Why is this money not being spent?  Why we not targeting it at those on the live register?  <\/p> <p> In addition, more money from the national training fund, NTF, should be invested in the apprenticeship scheme.  The scheme is in dire need of reform and expansion to ensure we will not only give young people more tertiary education options but also equip Ireland with the skilled workers needed for growing and emerging industries.  Sinn F&eacute;in has pledged to abolish apprenticeship fees to help to encourage more people into apprenticeships.  It would cost just &euro;4.8 million this year, a tiny 1% of what has been collected but not spent under the NTF in the past few years.  The Minister must clarify why this money is going unspent and outline how he intends to invest the hundreds of millions of euro that has built up.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in is not going to oppose this legislation, but we will be tabling amendments once it moves to Committee Stage.  There are some positive things included in the Bill, but the substantive issues I have outlined in my contribution need to be addressed.  I look forward to the Minister's response because I have been asking some of these questions consistently for many months and years.  I particularly hope I will receive answers to the questions I have asked about the reports that have been hidden away from people, some of the most vulnerable citizens, who need to see them.  This House is also entitled to see them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200039#MM00300","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573589100,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill on behalf of the Labour Party.  The principal objective of any budget is to, as far as possible, reallocate resources to ensure the most vulnerable people living in our society are protected.  There are important provisions in this Bill for which I want to compliment the Minister on achieving.  It would be churlish of me, as Labour Party spokesperson in this area, not to acknowledge this.  There will be approximately &euro;21.2 billion available for spending on social welfare benefits next year, but, of course, how it is spent is critical.<\/p>  <p>  In the most recent budget we found that the largest cohort of social welfare payments would remain as they were in 2019, which means that there will be no increase for the recipients of those social welfare payments in 2020.  This will automatically leads to a real reduction in spending power when the rate of inflation that will apply in 2020, approximately 1.3% or 1.5%, is factored in.  The result of Brexit is still to be finalised, but one thing we know for sure is that there will be an increase in the price of food.  We all support the planned carbon tax increases to try to deal with carbon reduction and climate change issues, but they are likely to mean increased charges for public and private transport.  The only thing we can say with absolute certainty is that in 2020 recipients of the main or core social welfare payments will experience their standard of living falling significantly.  If over time social welfare rates fall significantly behind average earnings, poverty is inevitable.  It is in that context that I stated, immediately after the Budget Statement made by the Minister, that if Brexit was solved, or softer than originally anticipated, the approximately &euro;339 million the Minister prudently provided in her budget allocation to deal with a significant anticipated increase in unemployment as a result of a hard Brexit should be reallocated in 2020 by way of a supplementary budget to ensure appropriate increases in the basic rates of social welfare payments denied in the most recent budget would be forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  The changes in maternity benefit in respect of stillborn babies are extremely welcome.  They are structured and critical.  <\/p>  <p>  The changes in the jobseeker's allowance for 18 to 24 year olds living independently and the ending of the reduced rate for those aged 25 are also welcome.  The increased living alone allowance is certainly something I salute, as well as the increased fuel allowance.  They are the increases that assist low income and vulnerable people and groups in society, particularly in rural areas.  The ultimate aim is to restore a proportional relationship between welfare rates and average earnings.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the provision of an additional &euro;4 million in funding to extend the hot school meal scheme nationwide next year.  That will mean that another 35,000 children or thereabouts in disadvantaged areas will receive a payment.  I know that the Minister focused on schools under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme and this is probably my last opportunity to make the case for a school in my area where I went to school, St. Brigid's national school in Ballynacarrigy, to be considered favourably for inclusion in the hot school meal scheme.  I hope the Minister will write it down because it is one of the long-standing DEIS schools having been designated as such in 1994.  There are socioeconomic indicators in the area that are important.  The school has a modern new principal.  They are doing their best and there are good achievements and outcomes at that school.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister will commit to a timeline for abolishing the remainder of the reduced rates.  It is difficult to conceive why there has been no increase in core social welfare rates because, as I have said, those on fixed incomes will face increased living costs in 2020 with nothing to offset them.  In recent years some costs have gone down, while others have gone up, but we are now experiencing net inflation to a greater extent.  As I said, an inflation rate of approximately 1.5% next year would mean that the real income of carers, pensioner couples and people with disabilities would effectively be less than this year.  In the real world the lack of an increase is a cut in all but name.  It represents a slap in the face for vulnerable persons in society.  It must also be a setback for Fianna F&aacute;il and the confidence and supply agreement.  Fianna F&aacute;il claimed it would gain concessions from Fine Gael in exchange for supporting the budget.<\/p>  <p>  The kind of Brexit being pursued by Prime Minister Johnson is also likely to result in the various issues to which I have referred.  Budget 2020 was meant to prepare the country for a potential Brexit, but it failed to protect those whose living standards would be most affected.<\/p>  <p>  I have already raised with the Minister the fact that the income disregard for carer's allowance is too restrictive and has not changed in years.  I am disappointed that she did not use the opportunity provided by the Bill to address the matter.  In the budget the number of hours a carer could work outside the home was raised from 15 to 18.5 per week.  I agree with this change.  It was long overdue and a significant piece of the review carried out by the Minister's Department in July or August.  It is a change that had not been given effect since 2006; let us be clear, therefore, that we have all been remiss, but let us not start pointing fingers.  When the finger points backwards, it means that I am also a part of the problem.  What is wrong is that there is no increase in the income disregard for carer's allowance to match the changes in the working allowance.  The Government has created a potential poverty trap.  Carers who work the extra hours might see their carer's allowance reduced.  We know that only one in four carers actually receives an allowance owing to stringent means testing.  The income disregard for carer's allowance has not been increased since 2008.  The Minister has said it is a very generous threshold, especially for a single person, for whom &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is not taken into account.  The Labour Party and groups that advocate for carers were looking for the threshold to be increased to &euro;450 and for the threshold for couples to be increased from &euro;665 to &euro;900.  I hope the matter will be reconsidered because the Department's figures should show how many carers will have their allowance reduced because of the increase in the number of hours that can be worked.<\/p>  <p>  This issue will ultimately have to be tackled.  I am strongly of the view that complete abolition of the means test for carer's allowance could be ground breaking and game changing.  The Minister might ask how that would happen.  There are so many people who could be cared for within the home environment.  There are approximately 350,000 carers in Ireland, approximately 87,000 of whom are receipt of carer's allowance, while 35,000 who do not qualify for carer's allowance are in receipt of the respite care grant.  They are persons who have clearly been adjudicated to be just above the income eligibility threshold.  The individuals for whom they are caring have clearly been deemed to be in need of care under social welfare legislation.<\/p> <p>It would be a positive signal to relax the income assessment procedure for this cohort of people.  Even if it costs &euro;1.2 billion, ultimately, it will be money well spent.  I have always advocated the abolition of means tests.  I would have loved to have been in a Government that had money.  This would have been a core project of mine in such circumstances.  People might argue that rich people would gain if such a measure were introduced, but rich people are already able to benefit in this way.  I refuted this argument in 1995 when the then Minister for Education was abolishing tuition fees at third level.  People were saying it was an awful measure because it would benefit rich people, but it benefited ESB workers and OPW workers who were doing a little overtime to get an extra &pound;20.  As an accountant, the Ceann Comhairle will recall that people got nothing if they exceeded the thresholds by 20p.  Very wealthy people like Mr. Desmond and Mr. Smurfit could avail of a covenant scheme at the time.  As I recall, that was costing us approximately &pound;35 million a year.  One can always make an argument to stop something, but it is how one facilitates something that is the important thing.  It is time we looked at carer's allowance.  I hope that someone in a future Government - I will be watching from afar - will take action in this regard and thereby become the equivalent of Deputy O'Dea's colleague, the late Donogh O'Malley.  There is no doubt that this will be something for the Deputy to think about in the future, when he may be somewhere else.<\/p> <p> I was surprised on budget day that there was no mention in the Minister for Finance's speech of the date on which the increase in the minimum wage will come into force.  I strongly support the Low Pay Commission, which was a Labour Party initiative.  We fought for its establishment when we were in government.  A former Deputy, Senator Ged Nash, was to the fore in that campaign.  The commission recommended that the minimum wage should be increased by 30 cent an hour from &euro;9.80 to &euro;10.10.  The Minister for Finance failed to announce when this recommendation will be implemented.  It is unacceptable that people on the lowest rate of pay must wait for a modest inflation-proofed increase in their earnings.  It was leaked the day before the budget.  Every budget is leaked nowadays.  I suppose Phil Hogan must be looking on in amusement from afar.  He resigned after he leaked a few lousy bits and pieces from the Department of Finance.  We all knew what was coming because it was leaked.  I suppose Mr. Hogan was fed up of everyone knowing, so he decided to get out ahead of everyone else.  He was not sacked; he had to resign.<\/p> <p> We knew in advance of last month's budget that the increase in the minimum wage would be delayed until March, even if this is not permitted under existing legislation.  Under the minimum wage legislation, the Low Pay Commission must make an annual report to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Within three months of the date of receipt of that report, the Minister must by order declare a new minimum wage on the terms recommended by the commission or on other terms, or must announce that he or she intends to decline to make an order.  If the Minister declines to make an order, he or she must publish a statement setting out his or her reasons for doing so.  On 9 October last, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, made a short statement setting out her reasons for declining to make an order declaring a national minimum hourly rate of pay.  The dates are important because I was proved right in my argument from a legal perspective.  That is why the Minister is here tonight.  According to her statement, she is declining to make an order declaring a national minimum hourly rate of pay until the situation with regard to Brexit becomes clearer.<\/p> <p> The reality is that she has not just postponed a decision on the date of implementation; she has invoked her statutory power to decline to make any order.  To be clear, the legislation as it stands gives the Minister a three-month window in which to respond, but it does not permit her to postpone a decision beyond that period.  Her failure to decide within three months means that no decision can be made for another year.  Under the current legal framework, she has effectively cancelled the increase in the national minimum wage.  I knew she was going to come with this.  I raised it with her in October and two or three weeks ago.  Now she is seeking to amend the Social Welfare Acts to allow her to reverse her earlier decision if Brexit does not happen in early 2020.  That is what this is about.  The Labour Party has serious concerns about her proposed amendment to the Social Welfare Acts, as outlined in Part 3.  There is a danger that this amendment will undermine the functions of the independent Low Pay Commission.  A Minister might be able to come in at any time and utilise this section to say, \"Stall the horse there\".  That is why I am concerned.<\/p> <p> I want to make it clear that if the amendment to the Social Welfare Acts being proposed by the Minister is passed, the amended section 10D of National Minimum Wage Act 2000 will provide that within three months of the receipt of a July report from the Low Pay Commission, the Minister of the day must by order declare a new national minimum wage as recommended by the Low Pay Commission or in other terms, or decline to make an order.  If the Minister declines to make an order declaring a new national minimum wage, he or she will have to lay before both Houses a statement of his or her reasons for doing so.  This has been done for this year.  In fairness to the Minister, she has complied with the law.  The new section that she proposes to introduce provides that even though the Minister of the day has received a report and has declined to make an order, and has laid before the Houses a statement of reasons for declining to make an order, he or she \"may by order declare a national minimum hourly rate of pay in the terms recommended by the Commission or in other terms\".  The power to reverse position and implement a recommendation, having initially declined to do so, will be exhausted when a new report comes from the commission the following July.<\/p> <p> According to the explanatory memorandum, the amendment the Minister proposes provides that \"where the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission has not been implemented, the Minister may nonetheless subsequently issue an Order\".  The explanatory memorandum clarifies that \"the amendment is designed to cater for situations such as the current uncertainty surrounding the timing and effects of Brexit\".  This means that the Minister of the day must, as at present, decide whether to implement a recommendation within the statutory two-month period but can then, without any change of circumstances, ignore his or her own previous decision and do the opposite.  The way it is drafted means that it is not so much a delaying power as a change-of-mind power.  It is easy to see how this power could be abused over time.  It could totally undermine the independent role of the Low Pay Commission.  The setting of the minimum wage is too important to allow it to be a matter of political goodwill.  I have concerns in this regard.<\/p> <p> When the House debated a motion proposed by one of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues on 15 October last, the Minister told the D&aacute;il \"that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission in their entirety and that the minimum wage will be increased by 30 cent to &euro;10.10, as announced in budget 2020\".  I put it to her that all the Government had decided to do was to defer the date of the implementation of the commission's recommendation.  She made no reference to the legal effect of what she had done and failed to do.  She made no reference to the need for an amendment to the law to help her out of the dead end she had reversed herself into.  In my contribution to that debate, I pointed out precisely what she had done.  I made it clear that the suggestion that the Government could hold off on making a decision while it awaited a decision on Brexit was not provided for by law.  The law is clear.  I reiterate that the Minister had three months from the receipt of the recommendations to make a decision.  The recommendations of the Low Pay Commission were sent in July 2019.  Within three months, she had to declare a new minimum wage in the terms recommended by the commission or in other terms, or decline to make an order.  If she declined to make an order, she had to publish a statement of her reasons for doing so.<\/p> <p> On 9 October last, she made a short statement on her reasons for declining to make an order declaring the new minimum wage.  It is clear that the decision which was made was not a decision to postpone the increase; in law, it was a decision to cancel the increase.  As the law does not permit her to postpone a decision beyond three months, her failure to make an order within that period means that, as the law stands, the statutory function of the Minister in respect of this report is now spent.  She did not respond to the argument I made during the 15 October debate.  This is part of the problem with debates in the House.  Ten minutes should be provided at the end to enable Ministers to respond to the arguments that have been made.  If a Minister believes that an argument is poppycock or is no good, he or she can say that.<\/p> <p> The Minister has refused to come clean and admit what she has done.  Instead, this legislation is being used to make a belated amendment to the National Minimum Wage Acts.  This proposal is a once-off measure to cover her predicament.  It is being brought forward as a proposed permanent amendment to the law.<\/p> <p> I want to signal clearly that I intend to table an amendment to ensure the power being conferred here can be used once and only once.  I will accept its use in the current circumstances to allow the Minister to reposition herself.  No self-respecting Administration could maintain such an absurd provision as a permanent part of its law.  I have said on the record for a long time that the minimum wage should not be a political football.  When a recommendation is made in respect of the minimum wage, it should not lead to argy-bargy in the Chamber.  We should accept it and move on.  As a matter of fact, we have gone beyond the concept of a minimum wage.  We are now in living wage territory.  That is where we are at.  I know the living wage is critical in urban areas, but it has now reached out as far as country areas as well.  Workers in urban areas have some access to transport, but workers in rural areas are stuck.  They might have cars, but if the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, keeps going, we will have no cars.  He does not want people in rural areas to have anything.  If one is to get from A to B to work in a job that pays &euro;10 or &euro;11 an hour, one must have some transport.  If I want to travel from my own area of Sonna to Mullingar to get a job, I have to travel six miles.<\/p> <p>There are not too many hopping around on bicycles, as was the case some years ago.  I do not want this issue to become a political football.  The State is directed by the Constitution to ensure that citizens - men and women equally - can meet their reasonable needs through paid work.  Most Deputies will agree that a good job is the best route out of poverty.  We want to achieve that, but there are people who need support, and social protection moneys are a vital crutch for those in dire need.  If we wish to build a fair and equal society, we must ensure that work remains an attractive option because jobs are the best way out of poverty.  We cannot have people living to work.  We must reverse that and ensure people are working to live and get a decent payment such that they can look after their family.  That is why the Labour Party sought to ensure that minimum wage was based on evidence and introduced the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015, which established the Low Pay Commission.  Its role is to consider evidence and make a recommendation on the level of the minimum wage.  The essential aim behind the creation of that body was to remove the discretion of the Minister of the day to ignore evidence when setting the minimum wage.  The Bill will have the effect of putting a flip-flop Minister centre stage again in respect of the minimum wage and that is why that section cannot be allowed to become a permanent part of law.  As I signalled to the Minister, my party intends to draft an appropriate amendment that would limit the change to being utilised on a once-off basis.  If such an amendment is not agreed to, it would open an appalling vista for low-wage workers and facilitate political interference to undermine the Low Pay Commission which the Labour Party strongly fought to have established while we were in government.  Our job is to ensure the independence of the commission is sacrosanct.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that some of the changes the Bill will make in other areas are significant.  Some are technical changes, which tidy up other legislation, such as the provision regarding payments after death.  That measure will be brought into being, as will others in similar areas.  I also acknowledge the measures in section 15 in respect of social insurance benefits and the increase in the earnings disregard for those in receipt of the one-parent family payment.  That is the one area of which the Labour Party made a mess and I put my hands up in that regard.  One-parent families and carers are the two main areas of social protection that need to be addressed and focused on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200041#OO00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573590300,"counter":466,"content":"<p>One of my Solidarity colleagues may come to the Chamber to contribute to the debate and, if so, I will share my time with him or her.  I thank the Minister for her presentation.  To begin on a positive note, provisions in the Bill that should be welcomed are the extension of the hot meals scheme to an additional 35,000 schoolchildren, the increase in the working lone parents income disregard, although it is not enough, and the increase in the hours carers are allowed to work from 15 to 18.5.  I also welcome that the blind welfare allowance will be disregarded in social welfare means assessments.  Most people would be astonished to learn that was not the case hitherto.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the commentary on budget 2020 is worth mentioning.  It has been described by Social Justice Ireland, SJI, as betraying the vulnerable.  The poorest 30% will be hit the hardest, particularly in light of increasing food costs due to Brexit.  Although the poorest will experience little increase in their income as a result of the budget, it is estimated that Brexit will increase the cost of living by between &euro;892 and &euro;1,360 per household per year.  That is no mean feat.  According to Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy of SJI, the choices made by the Government in budget 2020 mean that the standard of living of vulnerable people will fall and they will slip even further behind the rest of society.  Michelle Murphy, research and policy analyst for SJI, stated that those on lower incomes will be the most exposed to the increase in the cost of living as a result of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the privilege the Minister seems to have to withhold the increase in the minimum wage.  She stated that the increase has been withheld to see what happens with Brexit.  However, the Government did not hesitate to extend schemes such as the special assignee relief programme, SARP.  The Minister for Finance extended the programme for 1,000 executives who can cut their tax bill by 30% as a result.  These are high flyers who travel between various countries to attend business meetings.  Eight of them earn between &euro;3 million and &euro;10 million per year.  The tax break will cost the State &euro;28 million.  It is only fair for the public and Deputies to put the announcements made by the Minister on the Bill in the context of the overall budget announced by the Minister for Finance.  Top civil servants will have their pay reviewed and the Minister's adviser probably stands to receive a large pay increase, but there is no chance of a similar increase for the lowest paid, 137,000 of whom exist on the minimum wage.  It is worth noting that the vast majority of them are migrant workers, women or vulnerable people who work in the hospitality sector, the profits of which have exceeded pre-2008 levels.  Profits in the tourism and hospitality industries have soared but the low paid in those sectors are being held hostage because of the threat of Brexit.  We will seek a report from the Government on when and how the increase in the minimum wage will be paid.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the increases in jobseeker's allowance rates for young people.  This is an effort for the Government to pretend it is in the business of reversing older and discriminatory austerity measures.  The Minister stated that the outrageous attack on younger people in the form of the lower rate for those aged 25, which was brought in as an austerity measure, will go, while the even lower rate for those under 24 will go if the claimant lives independently.  How is anyone expected to live independently on &euro;112 per week?  The answer is beyond me; perhaps the Minister can provide it.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question asking her how many people will be affected by this change.  As well as eulogising the Government announcement that the age-related payment for those aged 25 will be abolished, her reply stated that the increase in the personal rate from &euro;157.80 to &euro;203 will benefit 1,800 of those younger jobseekers.  It also eulogised the announcement that the Government increased the rate available to jobseekers aged 18 to 24 who are living independently and in receipt of State housing supports, including rent supplement and HAP.  The reply indicated that her Department has estimated that increase will affect approximately 300 young jobseekers.  That is not worth making a headline announcement as though it is some great achievement.  How many of the approximately 29,000 15 to 24 year olds who were unemployed in June of this year will benefit from the measure?  When one calculates the figures, it becomes evident that some of the measures, particularly that which is supposed to help people under the age of 25 if they live independently, are grossly overstated to make the Department look good.<\/p>  <p>  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action and worked hard to demand a report on the fuel allowance.  We secured a priority resolution that the Government would report on it, but that did not happen.  Figures compiled by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other organisations clearly show that 28% of the population lives in fuel poverty.  The fuel allowance will be increased by &euro;2 per week for 28 weeks, or &euro;56 per year, to compensate for an increase in carbon tax which amounts to approximately &euro;60 per year of an increase in the average gas bill.  How does the Government square the circle on this issue?  There are significant problems with it.  Fuel and energy poverty are not just issues for the 370,000 who manage to qualify for fuel allowance.  Every Member knows this is an issue for many hundreds of thousands of people - those on low income, the minimum wage or small private pensions - who get no help in dealing with increased carbon tax.<\/p> <p>It will not even cover the total cost of that increase for the most vulnerable because most of them live in poorly insulated homes in rural areas.  They have to use coal, oil or gas for their heating.  They cannot change their behaviour and cannot go green tomorrow because they are not being given access to retrofitting or to SEAI grants because they do not qualify for fuel allowance or do not have wads of money that they can use to pay upfront and then have it returned by the State.  This goes nowhere near addressing that for the many ill and old people in that situation.  They are facing punishment for the sins of the fossil fuel corporations with no effort by the Government to tackle it.  I will again seek a report on the levels of fuel poverty and how this increase will impact on those for whom the Minister claims it is intended.<\/p> <p> Those are the only three issues on which I will seek reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200043#QQ00200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573590900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Life on low income is the norm for a large proportion of our society.  One in every six people in Ireland lives with an income below the poverty line.  That is 15.7% of the population.  As highlighted in a number of studies, this corresponds to approximately 760,000 people.  Poverty levels reached their lowest point in Ireland in 2009 when 14.1% of the population was classified as poor.  Since then the rate has increased, although in recent years budgetary policies increasing core payments have helped to bring it back down again.<\/p>  <p>  However, the budget lacked any serious initiative to significantly reduce poverty.  At rates of near full employment, the simple policy solution to creating more jobs no longer stands, especially with approximately 110,000 people experiencing poverty despite being in employment.  The Labour Party often comes out with the mantra that people with a job have a better standard of living.  We know that is not the case.  Many of the jobs available are low paid, minimum wage and low hours.  The Minister has met many of the employees of the Ivy Restaurant who were being abused by their employer.  Workers are getting the minimum wage with the contracted wage they signed up to when they started the job being made up by the tips that were being handed to the company, which it was stealing from the workers and still is.  <\/p>  <p>  It was a failure not to increase social welfare payments across the board.  I agree with SJI that those increases should have been &euro;9 to &euro;10 a week.  The Government is very protective of industry over the possible impact of Brexit with a hard border or an agreement covering customs only.  However, for those on the lowest incomes, who are most vulnerable to increases in food prices that could happen as a result, the Government has done very little to respond to that.  None of the speeches by the Minister and her colleagues since the budget has indicated that the Government is watching this very closely.  If there is a hard border with World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs kicking in, resulting in food price increases, there has been no mention of intervening to protect our pensioners, carers and social welfare recipients.<\/p>  <p>  The only thing the Minister has done is to say that she will not implement the minimum wage increase proposed by the Low Pay Commission.  To put that into perspective, the proposed increase is 30 cent an hour.  Someone unlucky enough to work 40 hours a week on the minimum wage would get an additional &euro;12 per week or &euro;624 per year.  That is what we are talking about and yet we were able to give &euro;28 million to SARP.  While I did not take it, the Government was able to grant in increase of &euro;1,600 annually to Deputies, Senators and higher public servants.  That is all no problem at all.  Everybody at the top benefits and is protected.  However, those on the minimum wage, who most need it, are told they can wait until the Government decides whether Brexit will affect businesses.  I agree we need to protect businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses, which are the backbone of the country.<\/p>  <p>  The feedback I got from old-age pensioners, carers and people with disabilities was that they were absolutely disgusted with the budget.  They were particularly angry over the lack of protections for them when they are probably the most vulnerable to food price increases.  The CSO household budget survey illustrates the exposure of households across the income distribution to changes in food prices.  It shows that the proportion of total household expenditure on food.  On average, households spend 14.7% of their total expenditure on food.  However, food represents a much larger proportion of all spending among the households in the bottom 40% of the income distribution, standing between 17% and 19% of total expenditure.  A sudden increase in food prices, which will be unavoidable following a hard Brexit, will hit these households hardest.  They are also the households with the lowest capacity to absorb such impacts on their living costs.<\/p>  <p>  Even with a negotiated departure of the UK from the EU, the absence of a customs agreement may push food prices higher and have a less severe but similarly distributed effect.  The households that are worst positioned, again, to absorb the impact of these potential price increases will be impacted most.  The Government has not even thought about how it might intervene particularly through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to help protect this cohort of people.<\/p>  <p>  Other speakers raised the issue relating to 18 to 24 year olds.  It is welcome that if they are independent and receive household supports they will receive the full rate of jobseeker's payment.  However, only 300 such young people are affected.  The Minister is saying that cohort of young people should be given the full jobseeker's payment.  However, when they buy a pair of shoes, pay their bus, Luas or DART fare, buy a shirt and a nice jacket to attend an interview, they do not get a discount because they under 25.  They are not told they will get a 25% discount because they are only receiving so much on social welfare.  They are living in the real world that everybody else lives in.  They pay the same prices for clothes, transport, etc.  I agree with my colleagues that this is age discrimination and should end.  Everyone in receipt of jobseeker's payment should earn the same amount so that they can live.<\/p>  <p>  I made the point about the minimum wage.  We should increase it to the recommended &euro;12.30 an hour living wage.  It would even be hard to live on that.  That would be &euro;492 a week for someone on a 40-hour week.<\/p>  <p>  There are some positive provisions in the Bill.  I welcome the extension of the school hot meals scheme, in which I have a particular interest.  My final point is on the fuel allowance increase.<\/p> <p>I agree with other Deputies that a &euro;2 increase compared with the &euro;6 increase in the carbon tax does not deal with how the people concerned will pay their bills.  The cohort of industries that created the CO2 and climate crisis should be paying the carbon tax, not ordinary people.  When the Government states it wants to move away from fossil fuels and offer people an alternative that they can install in their homes within a year and pay a grant to do it, it can start by charging those who do not move to an energy source that is carbon neutral a carbon tax.  Increasing it now is an absolute disgrace.  It will be hard for the people who depend on the fuel allowance and those on low incomes to deal with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200044#RR00200","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573591500,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak to this important Bill, which has been designed to give legislative effect to a range of social welfare measures announced in the budget.  I thank the Minister for doing her level best to help to deal with a protracted problem in County Tipperary.  The Bill provides for several technical changes to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 to ensure the application of income disregards for persons engaged in fostering.  The Bill also provides for an amendment to the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to provide that where the Minister of the day is not in a position to implement the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission, as is the case as a consequence of the uncertainty associated with Brexit, he or she may subsequently issue an order for the year or part of the year to which the commission's recommendations relate.  That is very good and I wish the Minister well with it because we are in uncharted waters with Brexit and an election coming up across the water.  It is nice that the Minister will have that latitude and be able to make recommendations in that area.  The Bill provides for an amendment to the National Training Fund Act 2000 to provide for a 0.1% increase, from 0.9% to 1%, in the National Training Fund levy payable by employers.  That, of course, is a broad outline of the Bill as provided in the explanatory memorandum.<\/p><p>It cannot, however, capture the huge sense of disappointment the announcement created on budget day.  Groups such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and family carers were bitterly let down in the poverty-proofing measures not addressed on the day.  I wear the badge of carers here because they do so much good work and have felt saddened that they have been left behind in the past ten years.  They provide so many hours of care.  In my county there are many child carers, young people who should be in school or at college but who are caring for their siblings or parents, which is very sad.  These groups, with a recovery taking place in the economy, expected to receive some little bit.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that, in terms of the rates of jobseeker's allowance, section 4 provides that &quot;the reduced rate of Jobseeker's Allowance for claimants aged 18 to 24 will no longer apply where the claimant lives independently and is in receipt of housing supports&quot;.  I agree wholeheartedly with this change.  The position was very hard for young people in that cohort.  I know the reasons the provision was brought forward, but still it was very hard on them and their families not to receive the full rate.  It was discriminatory and I compliment the Minister on changing the provision.  The Bill states: &quot;The full rate of Jobseeker's Allowance will be paid to these persons with effect from 1 January 2020&quot;.  That is ana f&aacute;ilte ar fad and very much to be welcomed.  As Social Justice Ireland has pointed out, adequate social welfare payments are required to prevent poverty.  That is very true, as the Minister knows.  She works in her constituency and hears it all the time in her clinics when dealing with families.  SJI states: &quot;Without the social welfare system 43.8 per cent of the Irish population would have been living in poverty in 2017.  Such an underlying poverty rate suggests a deeply unequal distribution of direct income&quot;.  That continues to be the position to this day.  In 2017 there were just over 760,000 people in Ireland living below the poverty line, of whom approximately 230,000 were children.  Some progress has been made which has to be welcomed, but it is not happening at the pace we would like. <\/p><p>From data I have received from the Minister's Department, I know that more than 5,000 people in County Tipperary have received exceptional and urgent needs payments, totalling &euro;1.8 million, this year alone.  That is a huge sum, for which I thank community welfare officers as we used to call them.  I do not know what they are called now, but years ago they were called relieving officers.  They have had some awful names during the years, but nonetheless they are a great bunch of people who do work very hard.  Sometimes they hear tall tales and have to make an assessment and sometimes they are mistreated and abused when they should not be as they have a hard job to do and do a good job, for which I thank them and in which I support them.  This highlights the fact that people cannot live on what they have or in most cases meet their basic needs.  There can be exceptional needs, as the Minister knows, being a family person, because of climatic occurrences or run of the mill accidents in a household, with damage being caused to equipment, which is unavoidable.  Community welfare officers need to have flexibility in that regard. <\/p><p>We learn today from <i>daft.ie<\/i>that rents across the country have risen by 5.2% in the past year and that the average monthly rent is now &euro;1,403.  The average month rent in my county of Tipperary is almost &euro;900 which, relatively speaking, represents a year on year change of 8.7%.  The cost of rent is driving families into poverty.  They will not be able to cope with a further increase.  I am not one to stand up here, unlike others, and demonise and attack all landlords as there are many good landlords.  Many have only one house which they might have inherited or bought and they have an exceptional relationship with their tenants.  There is a policy, on the left especially, of haranguing and barracking landlords, but if we hunt them out of the industry altogether, there will be no one to provide accommodation.  We have to strike a balance.  We have to have respect and it is both ways between the tenant and the landlord.  There are some bad tenants and also some bad landlords.  Therefore, we need to get our priorities right.  We cannot keep demonising landlords because they do their best to provide accommodation where the State is unable to do so.  <\/p><p>In March I asked the Minister to investigate the reason the number of social welfare recipients who had had their payments cut was reduced on foot of recommendations made by Turas Nua where the figure exceeded &euro;10,500.  I have had many a battle with the Minister over Turas Nua which I have described as Turas Uaf&aacute;sach and t&aacute; fhios ar an Aire cad &eacute; sin.  It is an awful journey and I know of some horrific cases, as does Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and many more rural Deputies.  I was pleased early in the year when we found that it would not accept any new referral and would be stood down in December.  Now, however, I find that it will not.  The Minister has given it a reprieve for another year.  It probably has some good points, but during the years I have certainly met people who have had some very bad experiences.  They were terrified and horrified and literally had not been treated with the respect and dignity they should have been as adults and young people in attending for interviews.  Many of the staff in Turas Nua are also quite young and inexperienced and are only doing what they have been told, but it has led to many difficulties and affected some people's mental health, as the Minister knows.  People were not able to cope.  I would, therefore, like the Minister to look at this issue again in view of what I have said about Turas Nua.  Many rural Deputies have many stories about people who do not have access to transport and are unable to make their way to the offices.  It is a more of a case of Turas Uaf&aacute;sach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200045#SS00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573591500,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Inquiry into the death of Shane O\u2019Farrell: Motion [Private Members]","time":1573592100,"counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200046#TT00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1573592100,"counter":473,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>notes that:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 5th February, 2019, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced the appointment of District Court Judge, Gerard Haughton, to conduct a scoping exercise into certain matters surrounding the circumstances leading to the death of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the purpose of the initial scoping exercise was to determine what further steps could be taken, and the Minister for Justice and Equality stated that Judge Gerard Haughton was &lsquo;free to recommend any course of action&rsquo; which he considered appropriate;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; Judge Gerard Haughton was provided with terms of reference but the Minister for Justice and Equality stated in the D&aacute;il and in correspondence to the O&rsquo;Farrell family that they would have an opportunity to consult with the Judge on those terms;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 24th April, 2019, Judge Gerard Haughton submitted final terms of reference to the Minister for Justice and Equality; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 29th July, 2019, the Department of Justice and Equality rejected the terms of reference submitted by Judge Gerard Haughton and provided terms of reference significantly narrower than both the Judge&rsquo;s terms of reference and those provided by the Minister for Justice and Equality on 5th February, 2019;  \trecognises that: &mdash; on 14th June, 2018, a majority of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann members voted in favour of a motion calling on the Government to immediately establish a public inquiry into the death of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; on 13th February, 2019, a motion was passed by the members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann calling for the immediate establishment of a public inquiry into the death of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; acknowledge that the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s terms of reference do not address the needs of either the O&rsquo;Farrell family or the Resolution of the D&aacute;il of 14th June, 2018; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; adopt the following terms of reference immediately for the scoping exercise as drafted by Judge Gerard Haughton who consulted with the O&rsquo;Farrell family, and which terms reflect the spirit of the Resolution of the House:  \t&lsquo;In light of the public controversy surrounding the circumstances of the death of Mr. Shane O&rsquo;Farrell on 2 August 2011, and having regard to the motion passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 14 June 2018 and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 13 February 2019, calling for the establishment of a public inquiry in the matter and having regard to the State&rsquo;s obligations pursuant to Article 40.3 of the Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights and in particular Articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 13 thereof as set out in the schedule below:<br \/><br \/>1.

To report to the Minister for Justice and Equality within 8 weeks of commencement with an interim report indicating,<i>inter alia<\/i>, the expected timeframe for completion of the scoping exercise.&rsquo;.  <\/blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputy Niall Collins.<\/p><p>It is now over eight years since Shane O&rsquo;Farrell was killed when he was cycling his bicycle in the vicinity of his house in Carrickmacross on 2 August 2011.  His death was a tragedy.  He was a young man who had his whole life ahead of him.  He had just completed his master&rsquo;s degree which he had handed in that day for assessment.  It was a terrible trauma for his family, his loving parents, Lucia and James, and his four sisters.<\/p><p>As I have said before, the fact that Shane&rsquo;s death is a tragedy and has caused great trauma for his family does not mean that there should always be a State inquiry or investigation into how his death and killing occurred.  There are reasons, however, that I, as well as this House, believe give rise to the State establishing an inquiry and investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell.<\/p><p>Shane was killed in a hit-and-run accident on 2 August 2011.  The individual, a Lithuanian man, who was driving the car involved, was subsequently convicted for leaving the scene of the accident.  The reason Shane O&rsquo;Farrell&rsquo;s death merits investigation is that there were significant failings by the State of which we do not yet know the full details.<\/p><p>I will outline to the House the circumstances which, on the face of it, give rise to a reason for there to be an investigation.  In January 2011, the Lithuanian man in question was convicted in Monaghan Circuit Court of theft.  The judge who sentenced him said he would adjourn sentencing for a year but that, if the Lithuanian man was convicted of any other fraud or theft offences, his sentence of one year&rsquo;s imprisonment would immediately be triggered.  Later that year, in May, this Lithuanian man was convicted of another theft offence in Ardee District Court.  That earlier conviction should have been brought to the attention of the Circuit Court judge immediately to ensure the Lithuanian man&rsquo;s sentence could be activated because of the breach of the terms set in January 2011.<\/p><p>It was not just that offence in May 2011 that gave rise for concern.  Later in May, in Dundalk District Court, the same man was convicted of speeding.  Subsequently, in June, in Carrickmacross, he was convicted for the possession of heroin.  In July 2011, in Newry, a different jurisdiction, he was again convicted of theft.  There were many further convictions.  What this indicates is that this man should not have been out on our streets at the time Shane O&rsquo;Farrell was cycling his bicycle in the vicinity of Carrickmacross.  That is an issue which merits investigation.<\/p><p>I, like the Minister, have met the O&rsquo;Farrell family.  Nothing that this House can do, or nothing that a judge appointed to inquire into the circumstances of Shane&rsquo;s death will do, will result in the O&rsquo;Farrell family being able to deal adequately with the trauma imposed on them.  Unfortunately, I do not believe the O&rsquo;Farrell family will be able to get justice in the way families are entitled to justice when their loved ones are killed.  The House, however, has a responsibility to assist them in getting answers to questions that are still hanging out there.  Notwithstanding the fact there has been a lengthy Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, inquiry into this matter, which is not yet fully completed, there are still questions that remain unanswered.<\/p><p>As a result of these unanswered questions, Fianna F&aacute;il put forward a motion in June 2018 seeking the establishment of an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell.  The House voted on 14 June 2018 for the establishment of such an inquiry.  Subsequently, the Upper House voted in February 2019 in favour of such an inquiry.  In fairness to the Government, it recognised that if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann are in favour of such an inquiry, there is an obligation on the Executive to give effect to the resolution of both Houses.  As a result of that, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, appointed District Court Judge, Gerard Haughton, to conduct a scoping inquiry into the terms of an investigation, whether an investigation should be needed and the extent of such an investigation.<\/p><p>At the time the Minister came forward with this proposal, many people were critical of it.  We could have been critical but we said the process should be allowed to play out to see whether there was a benefit in the scoping exercise and to allow Judge Haughton to conduct his preliminary review.  There is a benefit when it comes to investigations for a judge to conduct a scoping inquiry to ensure that the circumstances and parameters of such an inquiry can be properly defined for whoever is going to continue to conduct it.  We know that when the Minister appointed Judge Haughton, he was provided with terms of reference in February 2019.  The Minister indicated at the time, both in oral parliamentary questions and in replies to written parliamentary questions, that the family could engage with the judge about the terms of reference and that the judge could propose changes to the terms of reference to the Minister.  We welcomed this and thought it was helpful that there could be some preliminary engagement between Judge Haughton and the O&rsquo;Farrell family in advance of the conclusion of the terms of reference for the scoping inquiry.<\/p><p>We know then that as a result of what the Minister said, Judge Haughton came back with the terms of reference in April 2019 which he submitted to the family and the Department.  In fairness to the O&rsquo;Farrell family, they believed those terms of reference would be accepted, in light of what had previously been indicated by the Department.  In July 2019, however, the Department provided Judge Haughton with amended terms of reference which were significantly narrower than those submitted by him to the Department in April 2019.<\/p><p>We need to recognise that there has been considerable delay in getting this process up and running.  When one looks at what we are trying to investigate, it is an issue of limited duration.  It is an issue which relates to what happened with this Lithuanian man prior to the accident with Shane on 2 August 2011.  It is an investigation into the inquiry&rsquo;s investigations and prosecutions that took place thereafter.  This should not be a matter that has dragged on for as long as it has.  I note the Taoiseach said today that this has gone on for too long.  Everyone in the House agrees it has gone on for too long.  It is unfair on the O&rsquo;Farrell family that they have been dragged through this for such a lengthy period.<\/p><p>The motion&rsquo;s purpose is to get the Government to accept the terms of reference that were provided by Judge Haughton in April 2019.  From what the Taoiseach said today - and probably what the Minister will say in due course this evening - Judge Haughton may be coming near the conclusion of his scoping inquiry.  I still appeal to the Minister to permit Judge Haughton to conduct his scoping inquiry in terms of the amended terms of reference provided in April 2019.  A scoping inquiry is a limited exercise.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister said his concern and the reason for changing the terms of reference were the decision in the case of Shatter against Guerin by the Supreme Court.<\/p> <p>We need to recognise that the scoping inquiry being conducted by Judge Haughton is a different type of exercise.  It is limited in what it seeks to do and it will set out the extent of an inquiry that should take place.  The differences between the terms of reference as provided by Judge Haughton in April and as suggested by the Department of Justice and Equality in July are significant.  Our concern is that the terms of reference to which Judge Haughton is now operating water down the extent to which he can provide a detailed suggestion to Government that issues should be investigated.  For instance, we know that the February 2019 terms of reference permitted the judge to review the investigation that had already taken place.  This term was also contained in the terms submitted by the judge to the Department in April 2019.  However, in the terms of reference provided by the Department to the judge in July 2019, we are told that the judge is limited to taking into account the outcome or reports of investigations or inquiries that have already taken place.  This is a limitation in terms of what the judge can examine.<br\/><br\/>Another area where there has been limitation is that the terms of reference submitted by Judge Haughton stated that in its deliberations the scoping inquiry should have regard to the provisions of the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  This was not included in the terms of reference provided by the Department in July 2019.  I do not know why that has been removed or omitted.  Also, the terms of reference drafted by Judge Haughton specifically provides that the scoping exercise should have regard to the documentation gathered for the statutory inquest into Shane's death.  This is not included in the terms provided by the Department in July 2019.<br\/><br\/>As I said earlier, I note that the Minister has concerns about the case of Shatter <i>v. <\/i>Guerin but the problem that arose in that case was that a report, whether it was a scoping report or not, was produced by the investigator and it contained findings in respect of the former Minister, Alan Shatter, when he had had no opportunity to put forward his side of the story to the investigator.  The investigator, as we know, had an opportunity to speak to another affected party who gave an account that would have differed from that of former Minister, Alan Shatter.  There is no similar type of issue operating in the circumstances of this case.  Judge Haughton will not produce a scoping report that will contain findings against any individual in the same way as the Guerin report contained findings against the former Minister, Alan Shatter.<br\/><br\/>I recognise, however, that when we are establishing terms of reference for inquiries it is important that we contain precision within them.  I know that Judge Haughton, if preparing terms of reference for a future requiring, will, if he thinks it appropriate, be very precise in setting out what those terms of reference should be.  I agree, as I am sure the Minister does as well, with the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Donnell in the Supreme Court, where he spoke about how the lack of clarity about the legal nature of an<i>ad hoc <\/i>inquiry as a preliminary exercise can give rise to undesirable uncertainty both as to the steps required and the legal principles to be applied to such an exercise.  However, in the instance of this scoping exercise we do not see any such issues arising.<br\/><br\/>In the circumstances, I would ask that the Minister and the Government re-engage with Judge Haughton, who presumably has done a huge amount of work in respect of a scoping inquiry, and tell him that they are prepared to allow him to consider a scoping inquiry under the broader terms of reference suggested by him in April 2019.  Judge Haughton is a former member of the Judiciary.  He put forward these terms of reference in the knowledge of what was contained in the case of Shatter <i>v. <\/i>Guerin.  They were reasonable terms of reference.  They were not terms of reference that were drafted by some <i>ad hoc<\/i>committee of this House.  They were precise and reasonable and they will be of benefit to whoever is the subsequent investigator, if one is appointed, in determining the extent of the issues that should be examined in respect of the death of Shane O'Farrell.<br\/><br\/>As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on justice people come to me seeking inquiries into matters of public concern.  We have many inquiries operating in this State.  I suspect we have too many.  On many occasions when people come to me seeking inquiries I tell them that I do not think their issue of concern merits an inquiry or a public inquiry.  This meets with opposition and concern, particularly because it is an opposition party that will not support an investigation into a matter.  However, when I review the circumstances of the death of Shane O'Farrell and I examine them objectively and carefully, I believe an inquiry is merited.  I do not say that because of the trauma that the O'Farrell family have endured or because of the tragedy that is at the heart of this issue - the loss of life of young Shane O'Farrell -  I say it because I think there are issues that the O'Farrell family deserve answers to and there are issues that if answered would benefit this State.  It is for this reason I think the scoping exercise being conducted by Judge Haughton should be enlarged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200046#TT00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573592700,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, for tabling this motion for discussion tonight.

I want to pay tribute to the O'Farrell family, whom I met on many occasions in my role as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on justice.  Their campaign and dedication to getting to the truth of what happened to their loved one, Shane O'Farrell, has been remarkable.  I heard Lucia O'Farrell on radio last week again laying out all the facts of the case.  <\/p>  <p>  During the timeline over which we have been discussing these events there has been Garda reform, reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission reform, the establishment of a new policing authority, various reports by the Garda Inspectorate, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and a new Garda Commissioner.  There have been many new dawns and many new reports.  The case of Shane O'Farrell is a blight on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It does not give me any pleasure to say that.  I do not think it gives any of us any pleasure to say it.  We need to get to the truth of the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the Independent Review Mechanism, which examined a submission made by the O'Farrell's in regard to Shane's death.  We will all recall that there were many cases sent to the Independent Review Mechanism, which was an effort by Members of this House and the Minister of the day to try to deal with some cases which people felt were badly handled or where people felt they were denied proper process or justice.  This mechanism was far from satisfactory because people could only make written submissions to it and they did not get an opportunity to meet with people face-to-face.  This case has been through that process and GSOC.  We now need a public inquiry, the terms of reference of which we are now discussing.  <\/p>  <p>  I will sum up by setting out the manner in which this case has evolved.  The State failed the O'Farrell family in the manner in which the death of Shane was investigated.<\/p> <p>The State failed the O'Farrell family in the manner in which the death of Shane was prosecuted.  The State failed the O'Farrell family in the manner in which the complaints around the investigation and the prosecution were handled by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the State is continuing to fail them through the attempt to limit the terms of reference which we are discussing here today.  It is incumbent on us all to give the opportunity to go with the terms of reference that Judge Haughton provided in April 2019 and allow the inquiry to work to get to the truth.  If we narrow the terms of reference, that will narrow the scope within which the work can take place and it will also narrow the findings and recommendations that can be made.  It does not serve us at all well to any end.  I urge the Minister to accept the motion proposed by my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200047#UU00200","speaker":"1221","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573593300,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:&rdquo;

<\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>In response to Deputies O'Callaghan and Niall Collins, I agree with much of what has been said.  At the heart of the matter we are discussing this evening is the dreadful loss of a loved one by the O'Farrell family.  As we have done on previous occasions, I again express my sincere condolences and those of the Government to the O'Farrell family on the tragic loss of Shane O'Farrell.  While the Government has put forward a countermotion on this matter, I want to stress and acknowledge that we are all working towards achieving the same goal.  That is finding an appropriate response to the acute pain of the O'Farrell family arising from the dreadful loss and to their search for answers.  In this context, I am glad of the opportunity to clarify a number of important issues in relation to the matter.  I look forward to a fact-based debate on how we can fully address this matter in a way that is not only legally robust but of course legally compliant.<\/p><p>The circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell have been addressed on several occasions in this and the other House, most recently in this House last week on 7 November.  As I said then, the terms of reference of the scoping exercise being conducted by Judge Haughton were finalised in September.  I want to assure the House that there is no intention on my part or on the part of the Government to way limit or constrict the scoping exercise in any way.  I share the concern of Deputy O'Callaghan that this House can and must assist the O'Farrell family in pursuit of answers to legitimate questions as posed.  In this regard, the terms of reference for the scoping exercise are focused, as required by the law, which as Deputy O'Callaghan has acknowledged is clearly set out by the Supreme Court case of Shatter <i>v.<\/i>Guerin, to reduce the risk of legal challenge to the recommendations of the scoping exercise.  That judgment requires the terms of reference of a scoping exercise to be as specific as possible to remove potential ambiguity and focused enough to promote a timely outcome to ensure fairness to all of the parties involved.  However, they still allow for review of the issues intended, including the issues raised in the motion as put forward this evening.<\/p><p>Second, I requested Judge Haughton to make an initial report to me within eight weeks of the commencement of his work.  I am expecting to receive that interim report this Friday, 15 November, although I understand that Judge Haughton is willing to delay this to accommodate further engagement with the O'Farrell family.  That report as soon as it arrives on my desk will be shared with the O'Farrell family.  As set out in the Government's countermotion, Judge Haughton will, among other elements in that interim report, set out the expected timeframe for completion of the scoping exercise he has been charged with.  He will advise me whether there are any circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. O'Farrell which warrant further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out.  He will advise me whether any inquiry is necessary into the systems and procedures for the sharing of information between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service and other relevant State bodies operating at the time of the death of Mr. Shane O'Farrell.  He will advise me as to the form of such investigation or inquiry.  He will advise me as to its terms of reference and he will advise me as to the suggested composition of the investigation or inquiry.  He will do that at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>In terms of his final report, I want to be very clear that Judge Haughton is free to make any recommendation he sees fit, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  It is also the case that the O'Farrell family is free to make any representations they wish to Judge Haughton in relation to any matter they wish to see inquired into, in any future investigation or inquiry.  Should Judge Haughton recommend an inquiry, of whatever type, he has been asked to provide draft terms of reference for such an inquiry, as was mentioned by Deputy O'Callaghan and with which I fully agree. <\/p><p>I am anxious to see real progress on this matter.  However, I would ask Deputies to appreciate that I cannot and should not prejudge Judge Haughton's report or change his terms of reference, just as he is about to issue his initial report to me, especially in any way that does not comply fully with the law of the land.  I would like to take the opportunity to respond directly to the concerns I have heard expressed in relation to the terms of reference of Judge Haughton's scoping exercise.  As Deputy O'Callaghan and other Deputies will appreciate, in setting up the scoping exercise itself and in determining its terms of reference, I am bound to be guided by legal advice from the Attorney General.  The terms of reference of the scoping exercise must be complaint with the line of jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court's decision in Shatter <i>v.<\/i>Guerin.  As Minister for Justice and Equality I must act within the law and I would expand that to say so must all of us collectively in this House.  The terms of reference provided to Judge Haughton respect the law but I will repeat the point that there is absolutely no impediment on Judge Haughton to make any recommendation he sees fit, including establishment of any form of future inquiry if he considers that necessary and appropriate.  Again I repeat that the O'Farrell family are free to make any representations to Judge Haughton in relation to any matter that they would wish to see inquired into in any future inquiry.<\/p><p>Judge Haughton is an experienced judge.  Judge Haughton is a respected judge.  He is also very dedicated to the work he has been asked to undertake, for which I am most grateful to him.  I know that Judge Haughton has been engaging with the O'Farrell family and I would hope to see that engagement continue in this sensitive and tragic case.  This could be the fifth or sixth time that this House has had an opportunity to deal with these issues.  As I asked on the first occasion on which we had an opportunity to debate this issue, I ask Deputies to reflect on the situation.  I ask Deputies to acknowledge the points that I have laid out and to join me in seeking to make progress on this matter, while at the same time and at all times, as we should, respecting the operation of the law process.  In the meantime, I look forward to receipt of Judge Haughton's initial report in the coming days which will undoubtedly ensure progress in what is a dreadful, tragic case and on which we all seek solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200048#VV00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1573593300,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Adams.  I want to acknowledge the O'Farrell family and the work they have done on this.  I particularly acknowledge Lucia who has been absolutely tremendous in her energy and dedication to ensuring justice is found for her son, Shane, who lost his life on 2 August 2011.<\/p> <p>That brings us to this evening's discussion on this case.  I listened to the Minister discuss where terms of reference came from.  I know from reading his speech and from listening to him that he is informing us that the Government is not going to stand in the way of anything, is absolutely determined to achieve success in this and will not influence negatively how this will all play out.  The difficulty is that the terms of reference first suggested by Judge Haughton are different from the terms of reference put before us by the Department.  That is a contradiction.<br\/><br\/>For the Minister to say that he and the Government are determined to follow this through, and to use the Shatter <i>v.<\/i>Guerin case as a reason for that, rings very hollow for the family in the tragic circumstances they find themselves in.  He also mentioned that he expects Judge Haughton to submit the interim report in the next number of days.  The Minister said the judge is going to make some recommendations as to the expected timeframe for completion of the scoping exercise.  He broke away from his script and went into other recommendations or issues he expects the judge will deliver to him.  That is something most of us were aware of, that is, that an interim report was due from the judge shortly but that it would only deal with the timeframe and that everything else would be, as the Minister explained, advice as regards what he felt it should go into.  It is all well and good to put that on the record, but the reality is that these issues need to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately, we have a situation where this man from Lithuania was driving a car at speed and killed a young man out cycling.  Any reasonable person looking at the reality of this case would conclude that he seemed to get away scot-free.  That is the problem.  The State has covered up this situation for too long and has covered up something that is very rotten at the core of it.  That is something that we need to get to the heart of, for the Government's sake as much as for anyone else's sake.  I hope the Government acknowledges that we need to get to the truth of what has happened here.<br\/><br\/>Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled an amendment to the motion, which we will move.  It is a very short amendment and relates to the relationship, official and unofficial, of Mr. Gridziuska with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na handlers of informers.  We feel, as would anyone looking at this situation, there is an issue here that has not been recognised heretofore and that needs to be included in any scoping exercise or fair review of what happened because we believe that that particular issue has in many cases around the country led to tragic circumstances.  This is only one of such tragic circumstances.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister's pronouncement that he is determined to recognise that the law has to be followed and to ensure that it is followed properly in all of this would sound good if we were in a situation where people could see evidence of that.  The evidence before us is that the Government is continuing to shift the situation to one side and to ensure that that will not happen.  I hope that the Minister will withdraw the Government amendment this evening, that both the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il will accept our amendment, which was tabled in good faith, and that the Government will support the amended motion to ensure it delivers on this.  Supporting this motion, which undoubtedly will get through when it is voted on at the end of this week, is only one thing.  It puts in place a motion that does not bind the Government but it needs to step up to the mark and ensure it delivers for this family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200048#VV00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573593900,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

This is, as we all know the second time, that the family of Shane O'Farrell have had to sit through a motion challenging the failure of the justice system to deliver truth about his death.  I thank Teachta O'Callaghan and Fianna F&aacute;il for tabling this Private Members' motion.<\/p><p>The death of Shane O'Farrell, as we can all appreciate, was a devastating blow to his family.  The bad decisions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, the justice system and the Minister for Justice and Equality have added to their hurt.  Lucia O'Farrell has raised concerns about how the DPP functions on other decisions, of which the Minister is very well aware.  For example, the case of Crevan Mackin reinforces this.  Mackin killed Garda Tony Golden after the DPP decided not to charge him with offences he had admitted to, including possession of weapons and explosives.  It is suspected that one of these weapons was used to kill Garda Golden.<\/p><p>Some three years ago this month, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny met the O'Farrell family.  He told them that he would ask the Attorney General to request that the Law Reform Commission examine how the DPP could be made more accountable.  I have written several times to the Taoiseach, including to our current Taoiseach, to this Minister and to the Law Reform Commission about this, and I have yet to receive a response.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us tonight where stands the former Taoiseach's request to the Law Reform Commission.<\/p><p>In 2018 and in February the D&aacute;il and Seanad voted in favour of a motion calling for a public inquiry into the death of Shane O'Farrell.  The Minister has ignored this.  He appointed a retired judge, Judge Haughton, to conduct a scoping exercise.  He told the D&aacute;il, and he repeated this <i>ad nauseam<\/i>tonight, that he had placed no restrictions on Judge Haughton.  When in April, the judge submitted his terms of reference, the Department of Justice and Equality to its shame rejected them.  Worse, the terms of reference produced by the Department removed any reference to the European Convention on Human Rights or any investigation into the previous prosecutions of the man responsible for Shane's death, and narrowed the original terms of reference.<\/p><p>I have met Lucia O'Farrell and her family many times.  They are very brave and very determined.  They are another one of those families forced to cope with the loss of a loved one and being faced with a political system that seeks to close down efforts to get to the truth, and ignores the democratic decision of the Oireachtas and the imperative of the D&aacute;il and Seanad motions.  That is true also for the Stardust families and for the families of Seamus Ludlow, Jack Rooney and Hugh Watters who were murdered in County Louth.  Some 13 years ago, the Minister will recall that the then Joint Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights recommended two commissions of investigation into Seamus's murder.  The Government has refused to do this.  <\/p><p>It is time that the Minister supported these families.  He should not be here to represent the system.  The system does not get it right all the time, as he should know.  The Minister is here to represent citizens.  It is time he supported the O'Farrell family and I would urge him to do the decent thing and to support this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200049#WW00400","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1573593900,"counter":483,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom clann Shane O'Farrell a mholadh as an seasamh l&aacute;idir a ghlac siad ar son Shane.

No family should have to bear the burden of effectively going up against the State while also carrying the burden of loss of such a beloved family member.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement that Judge Haughton may be able to publish his initial report in the next few days.  I say that fully understanding any apprehension that the family may still about today's report and the concerns that it will yet come to fruition.  <\/p>  <p>  In July of last year, I implored the Minister for Justice and Equality to establish a public inquiry and I do so again this evening.  The intervening 16 months since that motion, which called for such an inquiry, was passed by a majority of this House have seen increased pressure placed on the O'Farrell family.<\/p>  <p>  They know that they have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, other parties and independent voices in this House.  They know that in June 2018 a D&aacute;il motion was passed calling for an independent inquiry.  That should have been the end of their struggle and their search for the truth.<\/p> <p>Someone or other should have been appointed then to take the search forward, but it did not happen.  In their search for the truth, while the memory of Shane sustains them, the O'Farrell family are motivated by the firm wish that no other family will ever suffer the prolonged agony they have had to endure.  From my experience as a Teachta D&aacute;la over the past 22 years plus, and as the current Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I believe a public inquiry is the only way this can be achieved.  We cannot establish properly what changes need to be made, what systems need to change and what legislation may be required, or required to be amended, without getting to the bottom of what went so horribly wrong.  We need to establish why Shane is not with his family today.<\/p> <p> Shane's family have shown tenacity and great dignity, to such an extent that another great wrong would be perpetrated against them if they were not granted the means of establishing the truth.  Establishing the truth for Shane, which will not replace the future stolen from him, may serve as a fitting legacy to his all too short life.

I pay tribute to the O'Farrell family on their commitment and determination.<\/p><p>This issue and everything surrounding the death of Shane O'Farrell are important for several reasons, the most important being that the O'Farrell family has lost Shane.  There is nothing we can do to change that but the family deserves answers and the truth as to what happened in the lead-up to his death.  Another reason is that this is a matter of public interest.  It is a matter of public interest in that institutions of State that are responsible for the administration of justice and for pursuing individuals to bring them to justice failed.  That is demonstrably clear.  The problem we have had, which has been going on for far too long, as has been acknowledged by Deputy O'Callaghan and the Taoiseach, is the back and forth on the terms of reference.  The D&aacute;il and Seanad voted for a public inquiry.  It is the best means and I hope that is what comes out of  Judge Haughton's recommendations.  I do not believe the scoping inquiry was necessary.  Public inquiries were brought about before without a scoping exercise.<\/p><p>I raised criticisms.  Deputy O'Callaghan said he did not criticise the exercise at the start and the terms of reference, which is fair enough.  In any setting of terms of reference, however, one is setting a floor.  I felt the floor was being set to low.  The engagement between the family and Judge Haughton resulted in the floor being lifted a little, but now the Department has gone back on it.  The heart of the problem with the attitude of the Department of Justice and Equality, considering many of the responses to debates regarding the revised terms of reference, is that it seems to be unwilling to contemplate the fact that the reviews undertaken already were inadequate, flawed and bad.  That they were flawed does not seem to be possible in the eyes of the Department and in any of the positions that have been adopted.  It seems clear to me and many other parties, including many independent observers, that the GSOC report was significantly flawed as well as delayed.  The independent review mechanism was also not adequate to bring the answers to light in regard to the numerous failures that existed.  The Minister has instanced the case of Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin and the precedent caused by that.  The Minister has paid tribute to Judge Haughton.  It would be very surprising if Judge Haughton were ignorant of the implications of that case.  I am sure he was knowledgeable about it and understood its implications and what it meant for the terms of reference he was recommending to the Minister.  It seems to be a debate about the extent to which it needs to be specific.  Obviously, there can be differences in degree but I do not believe it is the case that the Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin case means absolutely everything has to be nailed down and nothing else can be considered.  That is a significant problem with this.<\/p><p>The terms of reference we have ended up with are not right.  The initial ones were not right.  It would probably have been better to move to a public inquiry first.  I hope that is what comes out of this.  It is necessary not only to get answers and the truth of what happened but also because we need to understand what may have gone wrong with the Director of Public Prosecutions and other institutions of the State.  It seems there was a very significant failure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200050#XX00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1573594500,"counter":486,"content":"<p>It is now well over eight years since Shane O'Farrell was killed in a tragedy in August 2011.

The support for this motion across the House demonstrated that a clear majority of Members were not satisfied with the piecemeal investigations established to that date given that there were multiple failures in the criminal justice process in the events surrounding Mr. O'Farrell's death.  Piecemeal investigation meant each procedural failing was treated as a separate event, and there was no overview of the entire chain of events and of the litany of failures across different agencies and bodies that clearly had responsibilities in policing and the administration of justice.<\/p><p>The Government amendment to the motion, which was defeated, had acknowledged &quot;the commitment of Government, upon completion of the disciplinary process, to consider whether there are matters that require further investigation and if so, to bring before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, for its urgent consideration, any proposals that it may wish to make in this regard.&quot;  When the disciplinary investigation was completed, the Government did not revert to the D&aacute;il, as promised.  It failed, as its own amendment had promised, &quot;to bring before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, for its urgent consideration, any proposals that it may wish to make in this regard.&quot;  That was the first faltering step on the part of the Government.  Instead of doing what was promised, the Minister appointed Judge Gerard Haughton to conduct a scoping exercise.  That, in itself, is not objectionable as scoping exercises have become the norm to assist in deciding whether a full inquiry is needed and in finalising terms of reference.  Judge Haughton was specifically asked to meet the family and advise on whether his terms of reference should be amended.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality is on the record as stating Judge Haughton was &quot;free to recommend any course of action&quot; that he considered appropriate.  Despite all of this, the Minister rejected the amended terms of reference subsequently submitted by Judge Haughton.  Instead of accepting them, the Minister drew up new terms of reference that, on any reading, are much more restrictive than the ones originally drawn up for the judge and more restrictive than those that Judge Haughton had subsequently recommended.<\/p><p>The Minister has pointed out in the past 24 hours that the restriction or curtailment has arisen because of principles emanating from the Supreme Court case of Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin, which the Minister has advised must now be incorporated into any terms of reference or focus of inquiry, and that this is clearly the advice of the Attorney General.  This is all without bringing any proposals back to the D&aacute;il for its consideration, as the Minister had promised.  He could have obviated the need even for the motion tonight if he had addressed this in a timely fashion, as promised initially.<\/p><p>I compliment Deputy O'Callaghan and his party on introducing this motion.  It is necessary because the Minister has not reverted to the D&aacute;il.  The motion is, in part, a compromise.  It accepts and adopts the Government's view that any inquiry or investigation should be preceded by a scoping exercise.  I concur with that.  It is important because we meet every day or week somebody else who wishes to have an inquiry on various issues.  Such inquiries are important to the individuals or groups concerned.<\/p> <p>A significant number of inquiries are ongoing and some of them are so widespread in their content and objectives that they may never reach a conclusion or will go on for an extended period.  This motion seeks to spell out, with much greater precision, what needs to be brought within the ambit of this scoping exercise.  That is where I concur with the objectives of the motion.<\/p> <p> There are two separate but linked matters on which we need Judge Haughton's view.  First, we need a review of the investigations carried out to date.  I refer to the criminal prosecution in respect of Mr. O'Farrell's death and the previous prosecutions relating to the same defendant, including: the fact that he had been admitted to bail; the workings of the independent review mechanism; the criminal and disciplinary investigations by the GSOC; and the inquest material.  Based on that review, we need a recommendation as to whether there are remaining unanswered questions related to the circumstances of Shane O'Farrell's death that should be the subject of a further and fuller inquiry or investigation.<\/p> <p> We also need a review of changes in law and practice in the context of bail and bench warrants.  We need to know whether, because of gaps in the system, these awful events could occur again.  Is it possible that another repeat offender with two suspended sentences could be granted bail by various courts in this jurisdiction and be the cause of another death?  How many times does a person have to reoffend before his bail is revoked?  Has there been any reform to our law and procedure to ensure that someone who has been admitted to bail on many occasions, and has been convicted and given suspended sentences that ought to have been activated, could not remain at large and behind the wheel of a motor vehicle?  Could it happen again that a car, an unroadworthy vehicle with no tax, is stopped and searched by drug squad detectives and waved on?  Could someone convicted of a serious criminal charge be given a custodial sentence but have it suspended on condition that he flee the country?<\/p> <p> What is at issue is a demonstrable breakdown in the criminal justice system and a failure of the systems and methods that ought to protect ordinary citizens of this State.  That sort of breakdown is not what GSOC is designed to investigate.  That is the reason we need an independent inquiry.  The Government may disagree with that strong assertion.  It may believe that the threshold for holding a new inquiry has not been met.  The Government may think that a commission would not further our understanding of this case or uncover any further facts.  If so, the Minister must say so now.<\/p> <p> A number of points made by the Minister earlier are premised upon the advice of the Attorney General.  He reiterated that the Government is as eager as the rest of us here, and the wider public, to make rapid progress on this important matter for the O'Farrell family.  There can be no more foot-dragging on this important matter which has been ongoing for too long.  The O'Farrell family, who have acted with the greatest restraint and dignity, deserve no less than to have these important issues addressed and questions answered concerning the tragic death of their son Shane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200050#XX00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573595100,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to Lucia O'Farrell and her family for pursuing this case following the tragic loss of her son Shane.  I welcome Fianna F&aacute;il's motion and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  We will vote in favour of both.<\/p><p>We know from history that when a state , its Ministers, and top personnel close ranks and bar people from accessing justice that the hurt and trauma of the original injustice is multiplied and made even harder to deal with.  The loss for the O'Farrell family of their son and brother is an impossible one.  The search for the truth about the events that led to that loss is an added and equally impossible burden on anyone, but to find at every turn their quest for justice is barred, obstructed and complicated is an outrageous insult not just to the O'Farrell family but to all citizens.  It has to stop and it has to stop tonight.<\/p><p>This is the second time we have had a substantial debate on this case in the D&aacute;il.  Not for the first time, the D&aacute;il has spoken on this and, also not for the first time, the Government has ignored the voice of the D&aacute;il.  Let me be clear: the Minister ignored the previous D&aacute;il motion that called for an independent inquiry into all aspects of Shane's death and now he is fundamentally undermining the scoping exercise process.  The Minister said numerous times that the family could meet Judge Haughton and suggest the terms of reference.  In reply to a parliamentary question this year, the Minister stated, &quot;Of course, it is open to Judge Haughton to propose changes to the terms of reference&quot;.  In reality, it is the Minister and the Attorney General who set the terms of reference, making it impossible for the truth of all the events before and after Shane's death to be revealed.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach informed the House that Judge Haughton will be able to produce his initial report into the death of Shane O'Farrell in the next few days.  The Government must clarify that the interim report concerns timelines only.  The Taoiseach's comment suggests that the motion this evening is of no consequence and that the new terms are the production of this interim report.  The Minister has now left the Chamber.  He must clarify what he meant when he stated: &quot;I want to assure the House that there is no intention on my part or on the part of the Government to way limit or constrict the scoping exercise in any way.&quot;  He also said: &quot;I am expecting to receive that interim report this Friday, 15 November, although I understand that Judge Haughton is willing to delay this to accommodate further engagement with the O'Farrell family.&quot;  The Minister further stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI am bound to be guided by legal advice from the Attorney General.  The terms of reference of the scoping exercise must be complaint with the line of jurisprudence established by the Supreme Court's decision in Shatter <i>v.<\/i>Guerin. <\/blockquote>  <p>That same case was quoted to me in the High Court last Wednesday.  It seems to be wheeled out quite frequently.<\/p><p>We must be clear that the purpose of this scoping inquiry, should be to review the failings in the mechanisms of the State in the investigation of Shane O'Farrell's death and the prosecution and sentencing of his killer.  That is the key and that is the centre of the family's quest for justice and their attempt to make sense of their son's death and the loss that ensued from that.  That is the only purpose it seems to me for any inquiry into Shane O'Farrell's death.  I repeat, to review the failings in the mechanisms of State in the investigation of this young man's death and the prosecution and sentencing of his killer.  That cannot happen under the finalised terms of reference, as the hands of the judge are tied.  He is effectively barred from looking at the very core of this case and the reasons that this family has worked so hard to seek an inquiry into it in the first place.  That is an absolute insult to Lucia, to her daughters, to the entire family and to the memory of Shane.<\/p><p>Looking back, in quick succession we have gone from terms of reference that were, first, to review the reports of GSOC, then widened to include the criminal prosecution relating to Shane's death, and the previous prosecutions and the findings of the inquest.  We now find that it has been shrunk again to the current terms of reference which will only take into account the reports of GSOC, with no mention of the criminal prosecution in respect of this young man's death, or the previous prosecutions, the inquest or indeed anything that Judge Haughton originally had in the terms of reference.  There was no mention of the very reason that Shane's family has pursued justice and campaigned for years for an inquiry that would shed light on the events that led to this devastating loss.<\/p><p>The Minister has repeatedly stated that there is no attempt to cover up or to hide the truth.  If he wants us to believe that, or if words have any meaning, then he should ensure that the terms of reference of this inquiry cover all aspects concerning Shane's death - the previous prosecutions and the findings of the inquest.  If he fails to do so, we can only conclude that for the State, the truth and nothing but the truth would, in the words of the deceased Lord Denning who presided over the trial of the Birmingham Six, open up an &quot;appalling vista&quot; for the State.  It is time that we came clean and instead of dragging this out for years and years for this family, we should open up a proper inquiry into all of these events and let justice be seen to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200051#YY00200","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1573595100,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200051#YY00300","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1573595100,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I have met many people in my ten years here but Shane's mother made a tremendous impact.  She and her family have been tireless since 2011 in seeking justice for Shane.<\/p>  <p>  The injustice comes from an inefficiency in our criminal justice system that allowed the culprit to be on the road on 2 August 2011.  He should not have been on the road that night because, some time before the tragedy, a judge in Monaghan had said that if that driver was convicted of other offences, he was to be brought back before the judge and would be jailed.  He was convicted subsequently but was not brought back to the court in Monaghan, where he would have received a prison sentence and so would have been in jail on that fatal night in August.  He would also have been back in jail following convictions for speeding in May, possession of heroin in June, theft in July and a further conviction in July for having no tax disc.  Those were all breaches of his bail bond.  The question is why he was not brought back before the court.  The family has not had an adequate answer to that to date.  They have been failed by the system because that Lithuanian man should have been in prison.<\/p>  <p>  While the Minister said he was not placing any restrictions on Judge Haughton, the family found the draft terms to be far too narrow.  They wanted the previous crimes to be included and I do not think that is unreasonable.  There are questions of whether the coroner and jury had all the evidence.  Judge Haughton included these matters that are so important to the O'Farrell family, previous prosecutions and the statutory inquest, but the Attorney General rejected them.  The new terms are very narrow and will not answer the questions.  Did Judge Haughton have the freedom and space to draft the terms of reference or were they being restricted and constrained by the Department?  What is the point of an inquiry that cannot answer questions and give a comprehensive report?  Does the Minister really want to find the truth.  Serious errors resulted in a man being at liberty when he should never have been at liberty and so able to cause this tragic death.  We have the irony of the two members of US Veterans for Peace, one 78 and the other 82, who have never committed a crime in this country, being on really strict bail conditions, whereas Mr. Gradzuiska could do anything he liked when out on bail and could also leave this jurisdiction.  There are certainly injustices in that.<\/p>  <p>  We have had D&aacute;il and Seanad votes for a full public inquiry.  It is regrettable that the family still needs to campaign for justice.  I heard Shane's mother speaking in the Mansion House some time ago.  Her wish was that no other family would have to endure what they have endured.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, speak about potential legal challenges, the interim report and the judge having freedom etc., but the family's confidence must be seriously undermined at this stage.  I dislike the word \"closure\" because there will never be closure for the O'Farrell family but at least there can be answers.  They have been campaigning for more than seven years.  They should be able to let Shane rest in peace and to rest in peace themselves, but justice is demanded first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200052#ZZ00100","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1573595700,"counter":492,"content":"<p>The facts of the case have been laid out already tonight by a number of Members and the facts speak for themselves.

It is appalling that they have to do this.  It is sad that it has had to be raised so many times in this House.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice and Equality is not doing what it should be doing to look after citizens of this country.  It has decided that it looks after the State or some such mad thing.  I think the Department of Justice and Equality is the root of many problems in the State.  We have had problems with the garda&iacute; over many years which may be getting sorted out now by having dragged the Department of Justice and Equality, kicking and screaming, to making changes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Unfortunately, I doubt there will be change in the Department, which is sad.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and, last week, we had the Secretary General of the Department in to talk about what a fantastic new body the Department is.  It is the same Department of Justice and Equality and that is a problem we have across the board.  The stumbling block in all these cases is the Department of Justice and Equality because it sees itself as some sort of divine saviour of the State, of Ireland Inc., or whatever it is, and the last wall of defence.  It should be working on behalf of all the citizens of this country to ensure everybody can have a fair say and get a fair hearing.<\/p>  <p>  It is a sad reflection on it that the O'Farrell family has had to go through this since 2011 just to try to get the State to recognise that answers need to be given to this family.  All they are looking for is answers but they seem to pose questions that are too big, that the Department will not be able to answer or does not want to answer, because it might do something to undermine the so-called State we have.  What is actually undermining the State is the function that this Department plays in blocking citizens from getting decisions and a hearing on what can be done.  There is no doubt, in the O'Farrell case, that the Garda, the Courts Service, the Department itself and the  Director of Public Prosecutions all have questions to answer.  Those questions need to be answered for everyone in this State so that everybody can have faith that the organs of the State will work on behalf of the people and not against them.<\/p>  <p>  There have been three sets of terms of reference for this inquiry.  The Department of Justice and Equality proposed terms of reference in February 2019 and then restricted them in July 2019.  It shows the Department constantly changing the story and restricting this to prevent the truth from coming out.  That is wrong and we have to get to the bottom of it.  I commend the O'Farrell family for continuing to fight on to make sure they get to the bottom of it.  Sadly, if they were not fighting it, we can be certain the State would not get to the bottom of it for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1573595700,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening and happily support it, to ask the Government to acknowledge that the Department of Justice and Equality's terms of reference do not address the needs of the O'Farrell family.

The perpetrator of the act was a man who had a long record before the criminal courts over the previous three years, with more than 40 convictions.  The driver had previously broken bail conditions a number of times and had been sentenced to a prison term which the records show he did not serve.  The driver was on bail at the time of Shane's tragic death.<\/p>  <p>  On 5 February, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced the appointment of District Court Judge Gerard Haughton to conduct a scoping exercise into matters surrounding the events leading to the death of Shane.  The Minister stated that Judge Haughton was free to recommend any course of action which he considered appropriate.  On 24 April, Judge Haughton submitted final terms of reference to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  On 29 July, the Department of Justice and Equality rejected the terms of reference submitted by Judge Haughton and provided terms of reference significantly narrower than the judge's terms of reference and those provided by the Minister for Justice and Equality on 5 February.

The motion before this House merits the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I take this opportunity to convey again my sincere sympathy to the O'Farrell family on the tragic loss of Shane, their son and brother.  Shane's passing is an immeasurable loss to his beloved family.  As well as being a much loved son and brother, Shane was a highly respected member of his local community.  I know very well that the community in the wider Carrickmacross area, south Monaghan and adjoining counties hold the O'Farrell family in the highest esteem.  It is also a source of great regret in south Monaghan and adjoining areas that a young man of Shane's standing and outstanding ability lost his life in such awful and preventable circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the O'Farrell family has been failed by this State and that failure continues today.  I was glad to be able to contribute to the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' motion on this issue of such importance, not just to the O'Farrell family but to all of us who want to see our criminal justice system do justice to every family and individual in our State.  Every right-thinking person wants justice to be done.  The terms of reference, as outlined so coherently by Deputy O'Callaghan, are essential to get to the truth.  It is truly shocking that it has taken so long to get to the truth in regard to the death of a 23 year old cyclist in a hit-and-run accident quite close to his own home.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Niall Collins, and other Members of the House, spoke earlier of the great dignity of the O'Farrell family in their campaign for justice for their son, Shane.  I have heard Shane's mother, Lucia, speak on national radio and on our local radio in Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.  She has always spoken so eloquently and with such dignity of the awful tragedy that has beset that family and of their quest for the truth.  That campaign has been courageous and tenacious, and has commanded the attention, interest, sympathy and empathy of people throughout all of our island.<\/p>  <p>  In the previous Private Members' motion, we spoke about the need for proper cross-Border policing strategies and the appropriate sharing of information between the criminal justice systems, North and South.  None of us wants to see tragedies in the future arising from the dysfunctionality of systems.  It is deplorable that such a series of incidents were permitted, causing the death of such a fine young man, son and brother.  It is essential, as outlined so eloquently and in detail by Deputies O'Callaghan and Collins, that the terms of reference as drafted by Judge Haughton should be adopted.  The terms of reference as they currently stand do not reflect the spirit of the earlier D&aacute;il vote.  Those terms of reference would not enable this State to get the full facts in regard to the dysfunctionality of some elements of our criminal justice system.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the O'Farrell family has been tireless in seeking justice for Shane.  The State investigation into Shane's death has failed the family, and it is similar with the prosecution and also the handling of the family's complaints.  This failure will continue if these terms of reference are limited.  Curtailing the terms of reference is not acceptable.  The scoping exercise process should not be undermined, which is what our motion seeks to prevent.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, the driver who caused Shane's death would not have been at liberty if the criminal justice system had been functioning properly.  That is the sad summation of the entire tragedy surrounding Shane's loss of life.<\/p> <p>I take the opportunity to again commend the O'Farrell family on the great dignity, perseverance and tenacity they have shown in seeking justice and the whole truth regarding the awful and preventable death of their loved Shane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200053#AAA00300","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573596900,"counter":499,"content":"<p>As colleagues have said, this is a very sensitive and very important matter.

We want to get to the heart of the matter.  Judge Haughton sent the terms of reference he drafted after consultation with the O'Farrell family on 24 April.  These were based on the proposed terms provided to the judge on 11 February.  Before finalising these terms of reference, advice was sought from the Office of the Attorney General to ensure there was no legal impediment to their forming the basis for the judge's inquiry.  The Minister was agreeable at the time to those terms of reference and to the amendments made after consultation with the O'Farrell family.<\/p><p>In late February, however, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin, which influenced the advice provided to the Minister by the Office of the Attorney General.  The Minister and the Government have been guided by this advice to ensure that this is done in a way that ensures that the recommendations of the scoping exercise are legally robust.  The simple and unavoidable fact is that the scoping exercise must be carried out in accordance with the law.  I ask Deputies to recognise that this is in the interests of all concerned, including, crucially, the O'Farrell family.  We would not serve them well by establishing a scoping exercise without regard for the law, leaving its recommendations open to legal challenge.  I ask Deputies to recognise this and, further, to reflect on the fact that the judge is due to make his initial report this month - indeed, later this week - although he has said he is willing to delay this to accommodate further engagement with the O'Farrell family.<\/p><p>As the Minister clearly set out earlier this evening, while the terms of reference of the scoping exercise are focused, as required by law, they still allow for review of the issues intended.  Judge Haughton is free in his final report to make any recommendations he sees fit, including the establishment of any form of statutory or non-statutory inquiry.  None of us should prejudge the report and recommendations Judge Haughton will make, nor should we risk delaying or undermining his important work, either by challenging his terms of reference when he is on the verge of issuing his interim report or by asking him to work under terms of reference which are not in compliance with the law, rendering his work vulnerable to legal challenge.<\/p><p>The Government, the Minister and I recognise, appreciate and share the consistent interest in this tragedy on the part of Deputies across the House.  We all have the same goal.  While the process has taken longer than any of us would have wished, we ask Deputies to recognise that the process should continue in accordance with the law and without the delay or additional risk of confusion that would arise if there were interference with the ongoing work of Judge Haughton at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200054#BBB00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1573596900,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of the O'Farrell family, who have sat through the whole debate.  Their presence for the debate is reflective of their commitment to this issue, seeking justice for their beloved Shane over the past eight years.  It is unfair that the system in this country puts such an obligation on a family and that they are required to come here to canvass and talk to politicians, seeking to get Ministers to agree to terms of reference and having to meet judges.  It puts a huge pressure on a family, and I think we have let them down in the delay in which we have engaged in trying to bring this issue to a finality.  We need to recognise that this is not an inquiry that will go on for years but a net issue that needs to be investigated, examined and reported on.  It is now nearly 17 months since the D&aacute;il voted in favour of a resolution on this matter.  Had we started the inquiry at that stage, it probably would have been completed by now.<\/p><p>I thank all Members who spoke in the debate.  I think everyone who spoke has great compassion for the tragedy the O'Farrell have gone through.  However, there is also a recognition that there are questions that need to be answered.  Sometimes people are hesitant about establishing public inquiries, as if they believe they should only call for them or allow them if they will establish wrongdoing.  We should be confident about establishing inquiries, not simply where we believe there has been wrongdoing, as in this case, but also where we think we can benefit as a country from inquiring into events to see how we might learn about matters for the future.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to the amendment the Government tabled.  I cannot accept that amendment.  In effect, what it seeks to do is simply to get this House to endorse the amended terms of reference the Department put forward to Judge Haughton in July 2019.  It would be completely contradictory to the theme of the motion we have tabled if we were to accept the Government amendment, so we will oppose it.<\/p><p>I have not had an opportunity to consider the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment but, to judge from what Deputy Adams stated, the issue Sinn F&eacute;in seems to want to have included is whether or not the Lithuanian man was in any way involved in working as an informer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I had never heard that before, I am not aware of it and I do not think it has been suggested before.  Nonetheless I will give consideration to the amendment and perhaps I will speak to Deputy Martin Kenny, the party's justice spokesman, about that matter.<\/p><p>We also need to reflect on what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, said.  He said there can be further engagement by the O'Farrell family with Judge Haughton.  I know that the O'Farrell family have met Judge Haughton, and their experience of meeting him, I understand, was a positive one, but it is a matter for them as to whether or not they wish to meet him again.  In fairness to the judge, he is bound by the terms of reference he has, and at present he is operating under the terms of reference dated July 2019.  Irrespective of what the O'Farrell family may say to him at any meeting they may have with him, he will not be able to amend the terms of reference.  He is stuck very rigidly to the terms under which he is operating.<\/p><p>On a number of occasions the Minister referred to the fact that an interim report from Judge Haughton is to come in the coming days.  The Minister indicated he was expecting to receive it on Friday.  It is important we note that, under the terms of reference of July 2019, the interim report due to be delivered by Judge Haughton indicates the expected timeframe for the completion of the scoping exercise.  Therefore, as I understand it, the report he will produce on Friday will give an indication of the timeframe for him to complete his scoping exercise.  His scoping exercise will therefore take longer, and I would have thought the terms of reference for that scoping exercise can be amended at this stage to enable him to consider it in the context of the broader terms of reference he put forward in April of this year.<\/p><p>I note that the Minister referred to the decision in Shatter <i>v<\/i>. Guerin.  There were very specific issues in that case.  As I said, at the heart of the case was an unfairness in the former Minister, Mr. Shatter, not having been questioned or interviewed by the investigator in circumstances in which another complainant had been, and the version the other complainant put forward was preferred by the investigator.  There is no such issue here.  My understanding of the scoping exercise being conducted by Judge Haughton is that he is not interviewing individuals; he is conducting a paper-based review for the purpose of doing a scoping exercise.<\/p><p>We should also recognise what Deputy Penrose said because there are broader issues here.  When there is a public inquiry into tragic events such as the death of a person, recommendations will always be made as to how we might try to ensure, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said earlier, that what happened does not happen to other families in the future.  For a long time Fianna F&aacute;il has called for an amendment to our bail laws.  They are too lax at present.<\/p> <p>In 1997, the people voted to amend the Constitution so that a person could be refused bail if there was a belief that he or she was likely to commit a further criminal offence while on bail.  That was given effect by the people in the referendum held at the time in an overwhelming \"Yes\"vote.  In the opinion of Fianna F&aacute;il, the current statutory law that exists does not reflect in full the decision of the people and there is also a need to review and amend our bail laws.<\/p> <p> We need better IT systems in courts and within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it is apparent immediately if somebody who comes before a court has outstanding convictions or adjourned cases against him or her or if he or she has breached his or her bail bond in any way.  If we had we a proper, effective system in operation when the man came before Ardee District Court in May 2011, it would have been apparent when he was convicted of theft that he had already been convicted of theft in January of that year and the judge of the Circuit Court in Monaghan had said that, if there was another theft conviction, he was to be brought back and immediately imprisoned.<\/p> <p> I welcome the contributions from Members.  I salute the bravery and indefatigability of the O'Farrell family, particularly Shane's beloved mother, Lucia, his father, James, and his four sisters.  As a country, we have let them down.  Every family of a victim of crime deserves to have the State backing and support them.  It is unfair of this State to force the family to repeatedly come into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to meet politicians and canvass to try and get an inquiry established.  It is unfair that they must plead on the radio and come in to debates in the D&aacute;il.  Had we just ordered and conducted a proper inquiry when the D&aacute;il voted for it, that inquiry would nearly be over by now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200054#BBB00300","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573597500,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573597500,"counter":503,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 14 November 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200055#CCC00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1573597500,"counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200055#CCC00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1573597500,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2018, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019111200055#CCC00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573597500,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 November 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
