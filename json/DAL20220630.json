In the current year, more than 121,400 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  The cost in 2021 was &euro;289 million.  It is worth noting that in the last number of years, the number of children using the scheme has increased by more than 8,000.  In the most recent academic year, capacity was increased to cater for more than 1,500 additional pupils arriving from Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the school transport scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from the school they are attending and it is their nearest national school.  At post-primary level, they are eligible where they reside not less than 4.8 km from the post-primary school or education centre they are attending and it is the nearest post-primary school or education centre.  Distance is determined by the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann and rules have regard to ethos and language.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it is adequately supportive of the provision of service to students and their families.  The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes examines how the schemes currently operate, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the scheme.  The review also examines the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme in a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that use transport services.<\/p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-22 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school.  Wider considerations regarding the operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review, which is under way.  A number of meetings have been convened and a number of discussions have taken place.  Decisions with regard to measures for the 2022-23 school year will be made shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000003#A00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1656576000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I believe that with adequate vision, we can deliver transformative change in school transport that will take a large number of cars off the road and save parents a significant amount of money.

By virtue of the fact that we will have the emergency legislation in place, we expect and hope to be in a position to have placements for those children for September.  Obviously, however, I cannot guarantee that.  We hope the schools will volunteer.  We prefer schools to volunteer rather than do it on the back of an order or a direction from me.

I am fully aware of the vitally important role played by them in the running of our schools.

The majority of primary and post-primary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial services under grant schemes.  Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions, that staff member is an employee of the school and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa tabled a claim in 2019 seeking parity of these staff with education and training board, ETB, public service staff.  Extensive engagement has taken place since then between the Department, school management bodies and F&oacute;rsa to work towards a resolution, with the support of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On 24 February this year, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a suite of measures designed to improve the working conditions of school secretaries was proposed, which F&oacute;rsa agreed to recommend to its members.  As the Deputy indicated, a ballot was undertaken, the result of which was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.\u00a0 I was very pleased with this overwhelmingly positive result on this long-running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.<\/p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement has now commenced in conjunction with F&oacute;rsa.

This will also require the development of an IT system to collect the data and action the payroll obligations.\u00a0 As this work is currently ongoing, it is not possible to commit to an exact timeline, but the Department has expedited the process and will communicate further as the work progresses.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has issued a circular to schools to outline how the agreement will be implemented.  The circular outlines that as a first phase of implementation of the agreement, schools must, before the end of September, calculate the initial assimilation rate of pay and annual leave entitlement for secretaries and offer it to them.  Should the secretary choose to move to the new terms, the new pay rate should be applied by the school from 1 September 2022.

Some 131,000 candidates are undertaking State examinations this year, which represents an increase of 6% on the last time a full set of junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations were run, in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  There are significant factors which, when taken together, meant it was not previously possible for the SEC to give a planned date for the issuing of leaving certificate results.  These factors included the holding of a deferred sitting of leaving certificate examinations for students who experienced close family bereavement, suffered serious injury or illness, or were unable to present for an examination on public health grounds due to Covid-19; the commitment that the overall set of results in 2022 would be no lower, in the aggregate, than the 2021 results; and the availability of sufficient numbers of examiners to mark written examinations.  In addition, as with other years, sufficient time must be allowed for an extensive range of checks and quality assurance procedures in advance of the issue of the results.  These are required to ensure the highest standards possible are maintained.  The State Examinations Commission has an absolute responsibility to examination candidates to ensure their work is marked to the highest standards of quality and integrity, and the commission must be able to stand over the results it issues each year.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, officials from my Department and the SEC briefed the further and higher education sector on challenges that could arise this summer.

The cost in 2021 was more than &euro;289 million.  It is worth noting that in recent years the number of children using the scheme has increased by in excess of 8,000.

The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments.  Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report.

This followed the privatisation of three particular routes: Nos. 45A, 184 and 185.  At a time where we are supposed to be encouraging people and enticing them to use more public transport, a poor service is being provided by Go-Ahead Ireland in my constituency.  This has resulted in many people being left abandoned at bus stops because of services being cancelled at late notice.  This has developed into a situation where people will not use those routes because they cannot rely on them.  People are now resorting back to using their cars.  To say that privatisation has been a fiasco is an understatement at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aware that Go-Ahead Ireland is receiving substantial State funding to provide this service, which is completely failing.  I have consistently raised this issue with the Minister for Transport and I have repeatedly met with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The Minister has said that it is not his responsibility and that is up to the NTA.  I have also met with Go-Ahead Ireland.  The NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland are hiding behind a false narrative that it is down to staffing issues as a direct result of Covid.  Before Covid the excuse was that there was a bedding-in period but over the past two years, right up to this moment in time, the excuse for staff being missing is down to Covid, or whatever.  Clearly, there are staffing issues within Go-Ahead Ireland that is resulting in the poor service being provided.  This is fundamentally down to the pay and conditions offered to drivers.  Drivers are being trained and then quickly leaving Go-Ahead Ireland, which has resulted in a continuous recruitment campaign by Go-Ahead Ireland to recruit new drivers and train them in, only for them to subsequently move on.<\/p>  <p>  It seems there is this perpetual failure to provide a public service for bus users and potential bus users, certainly in my constituency. It has now got to a point where it is unsustainable.  People are now refusing to use public transport.  People are being left, at very short notice, standing waiting on a bus that does not show.  Last week, there were a couple of incidents where children and teenagers were left after the final two buses on the No. 185 route never showed up.  Those young people had to walk from Bray and to Enniskerry, along the 21 Bends, which is a very dangerous stretch of road.  The situation is now putting at risk the safety of members of the public.  The situation is counterproductive to the stated policy of the Government to encourage more people to use public transport. <\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State indicate what action is being taken to ensure that a better service is being provided?

I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I understand that the Deputy's matter relates to the provision of bus services on routes operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, and whether any measures can or have been taken to improve these services.<\/p><p>My Department has responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport.  However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services nationally, including those public service obligation, PSO, routes currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland.  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport services contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.<\/p><p>PSO services are socially necessary but financially unviable services and the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money.  Funding support has increased in recent years.  Currently, the vast majority of PSO bus services are provided by either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann through what are known as direct award contracts.  The remaining routes are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, which entered the market in September 2018 as part of Government's commitment to open up the bus market through a programme of tendering known as &quot;bus market opening&quot;.  A key Government objective is to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options.  Public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal.<\/p><p>To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department secured &euro;538 million of funding for PSO and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year.  This includes more than &euro;200 million of Covid-19 emergency funding in 2022 to counter the continuing impacts of the pandemic on fare revenue across transport operators.<\/p><p>In the context of the Deputy's specific question regarding the PSO services currently operated by Go-Ahead Ireland, as the Deputy will be aware and as he alluded to, the Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers, and the associated drop in fare revenues.  To date, passenger numbers remain below pre-Covid levels and demand is currently at 80% of that experienced in 2019.  This is expected to improve further in the coming months..<\/p><p>It is important to note that the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the staff of the various public transport operators that continued to operate throughout the crisis, with absences fluctuating throughout the pandemic as each new wave of the virus spread across the population.Unfortunately, Go-Ahead Ireland, in addition to a number of other public transport providers, is experiencing higher than normal levels of Covid-related staff absences at present.  As a result of these higher levels of staff absenteeism across the transport network, there has been a knock-on effect on service delivery, resulting in some services not operating as scheduled.  The NTA has advised that all public transport operators experiencing this issue are endeavouring to ensure that the first and last scheduled services operate as planned, and that consecutive bus services are not curtailed or cancelled, whenever possible.<\/p><p>The NTA has further advised that all public transport operators have for some months been working hard to recruit additional staff and, as a result, staff levels are beginning to improve gradually.  I will continue to engage with the authority to ensure that all operators in the bus market provide a satisfactory level of service to meet the demands of customers in line with their contracts.  I will also raise this directly with the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000012#K00500","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1656582000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>To say I am disappointed with the response is an understatement.

The poor service was there before Covid and it continues now.  The same response does not wash because I do not see the same volume of cancellations from Dublin Bus, which provides an excellent service in Wicklow.  There is not the same volume of cancellations.  The Minister of State said the operators are being advised not to cancel first or last bus services but that is happening.  It happened only last week in Wicklow on the 185 route.  It is having a direct, negative impact on the people who rely on the public transport service in Wicklow.<\/p>  <p>  The 45 route out of Wicklow is the only route out of the county that serves the National Rehabilitation Centre in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.

The Minister of State will be aware that as she drives around the country that the price of fuel in the forecourts has rocketed in recent months.  It could be between &euro;2.10 or &euro;2.20 for a litre of diesel or petrol in most places.  This is hitting people hard in the pocket.  I very much welcome the intervention to date on the cost of fuel.  Without that excise reduction delivered some months ago, we would probably be looking at prices hovering around &euro;2.40 per litre for diesel and petrol.  That has helped however most people filling a tank of diesel or petrol weekly will notice a significant increase in the cost of getting from A to B.  In most cases people are travelling to and from work, dropping children to or from childcare and doing the necessary journeys that people have to make every day in the course of their lives.  There is very little recreational driving going on at the moment because people simply cannot afford to do that.  I am asking that the Government to intervene further as soon as possible.  I understand this could be done through statutory instrument.  The Government could give a waiver for a year on renewing their motor tax.  This was something that we were able to do very easily during the Covid emergency when motor tax and NCTs were about to expire.

Rather than asking people to pay yet another bill to cover their cars with motor tax for 12 months that they be given further time free of charge to give them a break.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is getting the tax back through increased VAT on fuel and everything else in the economy.  It is only fair that we give a break here.  I have been told we can do no more on excise on fuel.  I welcome the measures that have been put in place to date but this is something that could very easily be done to target the motorist in a very positive way and give them a bit of a break in recognition of the extraordinarily high prices that are being charged for fuel at the moment.  It is something that would constitute an emergency measure but this is an emergency.  People are really suffering.  They cannot afford to pay their bills.

It gives adequate time to prepare a comprehensive package of measures to address the cost-of-living crisis and all the other challenges we have in the country but the budget will be earlier than normal.  The sooner these interventions can be made the better.  I am asking that before that, consideration would be given on motor tax that would give motorists a break and one less bill to pay for 12 months at least.  It is the least we could do in the circumstances.  It would make sense and the benefits would be felt throughout the economy because the cost of delivery and transportation impacts on all the products and services we use.  It would also be felt by the wider community and immediately by the motorists themselves. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000013#L00400","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1656582000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Motor tax receipts in 2021 were &euro;908 million.  Motor tax receipts accrue to the Exchequer.  Changes to motor tax rates, including the potential abolition of motor tax, require primary legislation.  These changes are made at budget time and are  given permanent effect as part of the finance Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A number of issues need to be considered in any proposal to abolish motor tax.  The driver and computer services division of my Department is  responsible for the maintenance of the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, the central vehicle database, as well as supporting systems in local motor tax offices.  The annual cost of running the NVDF is currently &euro;22.9 million.  However, the NVDF also supports road traffic enforcement, vehicle testing and the road transport operator licensing system and there would be a continuing requirement for it to remain in operation.  Abolishing motor tax would require a legal framework to be put  in place to ensure regular notification of vehicle and driver details to the NVDF, and compliance with that framework, to maintain an up-to-date vehicle database.  Abolition of motor tax would result in savings on the paper cost of discs, and on printing and postage, as well as some savings on staff costs.  However, it is estimated that would amount to total savings of just under &euro;4 million in the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government publishes the amalgamated audited annual financial statement for all the local authorities on an annual basis.  The most recently published statement is for 2019 and gives the total cost of running the local authority motor tax service at &euro;29.41 million for the year.  Total savings, therefore, would be in the order of &euro;33.5 million for the Department and local motor offices combined.   <\/p>  <p>  Motor tax rates are not a contributor to the recent increases in the cost of living.  The last general increases in motor tax, affecting all vehicle categories, took  effect from 1 January 2013.  There were significant reductions in motor tax for goods vehicles in budget 2016, which took effect from 1 January 2016, with the top rate of tax being reduced from &euro;5,195 to &euro;900 annually.  There were also some increases to rates from 1 January 2021 for some private vehicles based on carbon dioxide emissions and registered between 2008 and 2020.  The rates applied only to the higher emitting bands C to G with rates increasing by between &euro;10 and &euro;50 annually.  These  changes applied to some 187,000 cars or approximately 8.5% of the total car fleet. <\/p> <p>Of those affected, 120,000 owners saw their annual tax increase by &euro;10 with the upper increase of &euro;50 applying to 7,000 vehicles.  Motor tax is payable for three, six or 12 months.  Any proposal to abolish motor tax would also need to consider the position of vehicles under current taxation at the time of abolition.  It is likely that the owners of such vehicles would look for refunds of the proportion of motor tax paid for the time remaining on the disc.  This would add significantly to the first-year cost of abolition as 2.9 million vehicles are under current taxation at any given time.<\/p> <p> Another aspect to be factored in are the provisions of the Eurovignette directive, which provides a legal framework for charging heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain roads.  While the directive largely concentrates on the provision of mechanisms for infrastructure charging, it also sets minimum rates for vehicle taxes applied by member states to heavy goods vehicles.  The minimum rate for the heaviest band is &euro;929.  Since the reduction in motor tax from January 2016 to a top rate of &euro;900, Ireland has been in technical breach of the directive.<\/p> <p> Last but not least, motor tax is an important environmental policy lever.  Motor tax based on CO2 emissions is on a graduated banding structure differentiating in favour of the most environmentally-friendly vehicles.  Abolishing motor tax would reduce the incentive for owners to move to less polluting vehicles, potentially impacting the transport emissions target for 2030 set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021.  In addition, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare may have considered this area as part of its deliberations on how the taxation system can be used to help Ireland move to a low-carbon economy.  Any proposals to review or change motor tax should also be mindful of the commission's recommendations once published.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000013#L00500","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656582600,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I emphasise that I am clearly not talking about motor tax abolition; I am talking about giving a break to motorists at the moment in respect of a Government charge on an activity that is already heavily taxed and is already extremely expensive because of a number of factors, many of which are outside the control of the Government.  While I am not talking about abolition, I am talking about giving people a bit of breathing space for a limited period because motorists are already paying more than anyone ever anticipated to get from A to B.<\/p>  <p>  Because of the structuring of our motor taxation system, doing that would give owners of older vehicles, people who are typically less well off, more of a break than owners of newer vehicles because the ridiculous system we have taxes older cars much more.  Someone can drive a newer car with a value of multiples of that of an older car and pay a fraction of what the owner of the older car pays.  This would be a very fair measure.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome some of the positive interventions, including reducing the prices of public transport.  However, those interventions do not affect rural dwellers for whom public transport is not an option.  It is either non-existent or not responsive to their needs in getting from A to B, getting to work, or dropping children to school, childcare or elsewhere.  This would be a targeted measure to give those people a bit of help with their transport costs because they cannot avail of the Government interventions in reducing public transport prices.<\/p>  <p>  In conjunction with the Department of Finance, the Department of Transport needs to give this further consideration.  This measure could be introduced pre-budget through a statutory instrument.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the matter to give the hard-pressed motorists of the country a bit of a break because we know things will not get easier any time soon.  The Government needs to reduce any charges it is putting on motorists as much as we can.

People can phone 1800-828010 or go to <i>myoptions.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Last week, the news broke that the US Supreme Court had overturned Roe <i>v<\/i>. Wade, the case permitting termination of pregnancies across that jurisdiction.  It was a shocking reminder that rights established for decades can quickly be removed.  Equally worrying was the scale of celebration and pace at which lawmakers, primarily men, moved to restrict healthcare for girls and women.  These events are a sobering warning.  Some people in Ireland, including politicians, joyfully welcomed the news that the lives of girls and women were being put at risk, and we know this is especially the case in disadvantaged and minority communities.<\/p><p>While the right to bodily autonomy and healthcare, including termination - because abortion is healthcare - has been established by popular vote here, we know nothing is guaranteed.  Some groups are still actively working to deny the will of the Irish people and threaten hard-won rights.  However, we also know that the work is not completed to ensure that all people who need it have access to free, safe, and legal abortions in Ireland.<\/p><p>Recent UK Department of Health and Social Care figures show that 367 people from the island of Ireland were forced to travel to Britain for an abortion in 2021 - 206 from the Republic and 161 from the North.  These are just the UK figures of people giving Irish addresses.  In reality, there are many more.<\/p><p>For those travelling from the Republic, the vast majority were more than 12 weeks pregnant, with fatal foetal anomaly cases being the leading reason.  This is an indictment of our current abortion laws.  These are not abstract numbers; each one is a person being forced to leave the State for healthcare.  In many cases, it is women and their partners enduring the pain of complicated pregnancies and foetal anomalies.  These are heart-breaking and clinically complex situations.  It is beyond disgraceful that our laws after repeal are still forcing hundreds of girls and women to travel for healthcare.<\/p><p>They are in the midst of the most difficult and emotional decisions they will ever have to make.  They then need to navigate travelling to another jurisdiction, going through the chaos of Dublin Airport, or being fearful if they can afford it in a cost-of-living crisis.  People living in rural areas, working-class people, disabled people, migrants and people living in direct provision all face additional barriers.  It is important to note that the Abortion Support Network is a UK charity which provides financial assistance, accommodation and consultation to people from Ireland and other jurisdictions to access care in Britain.<\/p><p>Our laws are forcing suffering onto people already going through one of the worst events of their lives.  The incredible work of Termination for Medical Reasons and all the courageous women and families who told their stories reveal the lived reality of this oppressive legislation.  The current review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 must remove these cruel restrictions.  Other restrictions need to also be addressed, such as the three-day waiting period, which has no basis in medical science, and the absence of abortion services in large parts of the country.<\/p><p>Recent events in the US have brought this situation back into the headlines, but it has been the lived experience for many since repeal.  It is now up to the Government to help them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000014#M00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1656582600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which is very timely in light of everything that has gone on in US.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, sends his apologies.  I am taking the matter on his behalf and I will read out his exact script if that is okay.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we acknowledge the very upsetting situations faced and difficult decisions made by the people behind these statistics, and the very sad circumstances that surround these terminations of pregnancy.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act permits terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of a pregnant woman; where there is a condition present likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. <\/p>  <p>  Expanded termination of pregnancy services commenced on 1 January 2019 and are provided through participating doctors and hospitals throughout the country.  However, I am aware that statistics reported by the Department of Health and Social Care in the UK showed that women with Irish addresses continued to access termination of pregnancy services in that jurisdiction in 2021.<\/p>  <p>I assure the Deputy that it is a priority for my Department that the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is fully implemented and is performing as it should be to enable all women in Ireland to access services quickly and easily without bias or judgment.  There has been a substantial reduction in the number of people with Irish resident addresses availing of termination of pregnancy services in the UK since the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and the commencement of services.  There is regular ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise.  We will continue to ensure the positive rolling out and enhancement of these healthcare services.<\/p> <p> Four years ago, the Irish people voted decisively to change the Constitution and give the Legislature responsibility to regulate termination of pregnancy services.  The people voted in the knowledge of the legislative proposals that would be progressed to deliver on this outcome.  In line with the statutory and Government commitments, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has commenced this review of the operation of Act.  The review will assess the effectiveness of the operation of the legislation and will be conducted in a fair and transparent manner.<\/p> <p> The review is being led by an independent chair and comprises two main phases.  As part of the first phase of the review, information and evidence on the operation of the Act is being collected from women who use the service and from health professionals who provide the service, along with the views of the public through a public consultation, which closed on 1 April.  In the second phase of the review, the chair will assess the extent to which the objectives have and have not been achieved and will make recommendations to address any barriers identified.  The chair is expected to conclude her report and provide a report to the Minister at the end of the year.  This process will provide an important examination of how our termination services are operating and will give us a chance, where necessary, to identify improvements to the operation of the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000014#M00600","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656583200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has said that current legislation enables all women to access abortion services but it does not.  There were 367 women who travelled to the UK that we know of but clearly there are many more, and they did not have access to that healthcare in Ireland.  It is deeply disappointing and concerning that the Government is determined to review only the operation of the Act rather than providing the changes necessary to prevent further suffering.  Could we honestly say we are happy with the fact that women and families who received the worst possible news are being forced to travel to another country for healthcare?<\/p>  <p>  The review of the legislation is a missed opportunity to update our laws in line with best medical practice and the lived experience of families.  Regrettably, the lack of action and resolve on this and related issues is clear.  The Government has failed to bring forward promised legislation on safe access zones around GP surgeries and hospitals.  Instead, the Together for Safety group has, in co-ordination with Senators, sought to progress a Bill where the Government has failed to do so.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the larger context of maternal healthcare in Ireland.  We are years, if not decades, away from a patient-centred system in which midwives have a leading role.  We have shockingly low rates of home births in Ireland, with an institutional culture of forcing women into maternity hospitals.  The Community Midwives Association and the Midwives Association of Ireland have called the HSE ban on water births \"non-evidence based, unethical and inequitable\".  More than 3,000 women annually are hospitalised because of severe pregnancy sickness when a medication that could assist in many cases is unavailable on the drugs payment scheme or medical card.  There is also a vastly disproportionate over-representation of ethnic minority women among maternal deaths in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  All of these matters are connected to how maternal and abortion healthcare are treated in Ireland.  An unwillingness to provide the full range of abortion care needed by girls and women is the same unwillingness to provide the full range of properly resourced maternal healthcare.

I ask for a progress update on the ongoing house building targets for 2022.  We have seen some reports in the media during the week and there seems to be a discrepancy between details provided by the Department and what will realistically be produced.  I would appreciate the Minister providing an update in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I am in my mid-20s and the youngest Member in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, so I am acutely aware of the significant challenges facing a new generation of people without assets who want to be able to purchase their own homes but simply cannot because of the current level of pricing.  It is an enormous concern and this Government more than any other in recent memory has given it the priority it deserves.  I have plenty of confidence in the current plan being put forward, although I have some concerns around who will end up owning the homes we build on completion.  These are valid concerns that must be put forward and I will take this opportunity to make that particular point.<\/p>  <p>  In the construction of new housing it is great to see a significant ramping up of social and affordable housing.  I want to put the case for tens of thousands of young, educated working professionals who are the life of the Irish economy but who are unable to purchase their own homes.  I am a Cork Deputy but I will speak about Dublin because it is important to recognise it as a primary city that is a huge part of the ecosystem of developing young working professionals who may be educated in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  People travel from all over the country to work in Dublin in many of our companies across a range of different sectors at a young age before eventually transferring back to their home.  That seems to be the pattern for so many young Irish working people.<\/p>  <p>  Somebody who wants to rent a two-bedroom apartment in this city with the simple luxury of an en suite bathroom could expect to pay well in excess of &euro;2,000 per month.  With parking, that could go to &euro;2,600 or &euro;2,800 in many parts of the city.  This shows the system is utterly broken.<\/p>  <p>  I respect the Central Bank of Ireland's independence but we are elected by the people.  It must be acknowledged that for so many people who are fortunate or in a good position to earn a high wage, it is unrealistic to expect them to get a 10% deposit if they have been paying extremely high rents over five, six or seven years, which in itself proves they are more than capable of meeting mortgage repayment obligations.  As a Government we must go to the Central Bank to outline our specific concerns in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  There are so many people who could buy a house tomorrow, with mortgage repayments significantly lower than rent.  Although a mortgage is a major burden on every family in this country and any individual who is repaying a mortgage, at the end of the term he or she owns the asset.  It would not be a cuckoo fund in Singapore, Shanghai or Tokyo owning it.  It is deeply frustrating to know this when I listen to many of the esteemed economists advising there is a requirement for them to be involved with the market to push the building of new premises in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The simple reality is those who are in a position to be able to purchase houses in Ireland and repay mortgages are being restricted because they are paying high rents and there is a requirement for a deposit when buying.  It is perhaps something we could look at.  I look forward to the information the Minister of State will provide to the House on housing provision for 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000015#N00500","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1656583200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to provide an update on social and affordable housing provision.  I am taking this on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who sends his apologies but who has provided me with the reply to the Deputy's question.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All is the Government's plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade.  This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes out to 2030.  The focus of the social housing programme will be to increase the number of new builds with a target to reach delivery of more than 9,500 new-build homes on average every year for the next five years to 2026.<\/p> <p>In September 2021, the Minister issued targets for new-build social housing to all local authorities for the period 2022 to 2026.  Delivery of affordable new housing is also a key objective across the affordable housing delivery streams.  In March of this year, five-year affordable purchase and cost rental delivery targets were issued to those local authorities with an identified and significant need for affordable housing provision.  <\/p> <p> One of the actions in Housing for All requires local authorities to develop and submit housing delivery action plans to include details of their social and affordable housing delivery.  In the action plans, local authorities provide information on the location where housing will be delivered and the planned number of homes to be delivered in each year.  The plans also include information on other delivery streams, including delivery by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency, LDA.  All local authorities submitted initial housing delivery action plans to the Minister in December and there has been further engagement between local authorities and the Department to ensure all plans are consistent with social and affordable targets, in addition to the range of policies set out in Housing for All.  <\/p> <p> This year sees the beginning of delivery under the range of affordable housing programmes, representing the first State-supported affordable housing and delivery in a decade.  Households are already enjoying the benefits of the new cost rental tenancies, with over 200 homes already tenanted and more schemes opening between now and the end of the year.  <\/p> <p> The first local authority affordable purchase homes in south Dublin will have their new owners next month and in Cork city, we will be advertising shortly affordable homes for purchase in two schemes.  In addition, the first home shared equity schemes will launch next week and will be funded to support 8,000 home purchases by 2026 by affordability constrained first-time buyers and some households starting again under a fresh start principle.

I know the Minister of State shares that view.  I thank her for the response and I appreciate it but I ask her to bring back to the Minister the message that I want this year's figures, which I asked for but did not get this morning.<\/p>  <p>  We have done Trojan work.  The sole focus of much of the discussion in Fianna F&aacute;il was that we would take the broken housing system when we entered Government in 2020 and try to put in proactive measures to increase the supply of housing, despite having to deal with a pandemic.  That cannot be disputed and I fundamentally disagree with what many Opposition parties wanted to do to fix the problem.  By tearing up the rule book, we will push the process back by a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  When these houses come on stream, whether it is the houses for which planning permission has been granted or new private housing developments, I am concerned about who is going to buy them.  I want domestic residents and first-time buyers in this country to be prioritised over the next two to three years.  I make no apology for saying that.  We need to tackle the argument that there is a necessity to have vulture and cuckoo funds and other institutional investors involved in financing the construction and purchase of new apartment developments and housing developments in this country in order for them to be built.  We must remove that argument and reallocate that demand by looking at the tens of thousands of people who in recent years have clearly demonstrated that they can afford to pay the price of a mortgage because many are paying rents that are double what they would pay in a mortgage.  I ask that the Minister champion this matter on behalf of the House with the Central Bank.  While I recognise the Central Bank's independence, it is failing and that has to be acknowledged.  The social and economic consequence of what is happening when it comes to who is purchasing residential property is absolutely shocking and we need to put a stop to it.

T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht de dh&iacute;th ar na teaghlaigh seo anois.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the State, families are in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis.  Many parents find themselves under serious financial pressure.  Times are very tough for parents whose number one priority is their children.  I have said before that the cost-of-living crisis is happening right here, right now.  Workers and families cannot afford to wait any longer.  There is a serious concern that, faced with a cost-of-living crisis, families will face real difficulty in meeting back-to-school costs.  Many parents are viewing their child returning to school in August with a sense of dread.  They are sensing that because of high costs at a time when they are already being put to the pins of their collars.  Schoolbook lists began to arrive last week and this week in many households across the State.  No parent should dread their child's return to school but that is what is happening in so many households.<\/p>  <p>  My party's education spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, spoke to a mother from Cork who faces back-to-school costs of &euro;1,700.  She is, in her own words, terrified as to how she can make ends meet.  Last year, a back-to-school survey was carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions, which found that parents were spending &euro;1,500 per child returning to secondary school and &euro;1,200 per child returning to primary school.  One quarter of these families were going into debt to cover these costs.  That means using their credit cards, taking out loans and even going to the local moneylender just to send their kids to school.  This year, in a cost-of-living crisis where bills and prices have continued to spiral, many parents are stressed and really anxious.  A child's education should be a cherished right, but for so many, the price of education is a cause of concern and anxiety.  That is simply wrong.<\/p>  <p>  This week, we heard from staff at Barnardos who described families buying their children pyjamas to wear in the daytime because it was the cheapest option.  It was the only option they could afford.  For a Republic that was meant to be established on the basis of cherishing all the children of the nation equally, this is the grim reality of Ireland today.<\/p>  <p>  Last night, the Government voted against Sinn F&eacute;in's motion to introduce an emergency budget that would lift the pressures off families in the here and now, including measures to support them in meeting back-to-school costs.  Given the Government's vote against Sinn F&eacute;in's motion last night, the T&aacute;naiste's message to struggling workers and families is clear: the Government will not provide further support to them now or over the summer months.   The message is simply clear that they are on their own during this time.<\/p>  <p>  What will the T&aacute;naiste say to that terrified mother in Cork who faces school costs of &euro;1,700 and does not know how she will make ends meet?  What will he say to her given the Government's stance that it will have no further interventions until budget time?  What will he say to the tens of thousands of other mothers and fathers in exactly the same position, worried about how they will meet the costs of their children going back to education as the school bills roll in this week like they did last week?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000017#T00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1656584400,"counter":145,"content":"<p>At the outset, I acknowledge the fact that the cost of living in Ireland is rising very fast.  Indeed, this is the case all around the world.  Governments are doing their best to deal with that but there is only so much any government can do.  Obviously, people have seen big increases in the cost of petrol and diesel, utility bills, grocery bills and other bills as well.  Everyone is feeling the squeeze, of course, but some people, particularly those on the lowest incomes, those with large families and those in rural areas, are feeling the pinch of that all the tighter.  Sometimes, they have to make very difficult decisions on what to spend money.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has acted already.  If the Deputy compares what we have done in Ireland relative to what has been done in similar countries, we have done just as much if not more.  As the Deputy knows, we had a budget package that kicked in in January with an increase in the minimum wage, reductions in income tax and increases in pension and welfare payments, including targeted payments such as the living alone allowance and fuel allowance.  We effectively had a mini-budget or emergency budget already, with &euro;1.4 billion in measures since the budget, including reducing excise on petrol and diesel, reducing VAT on electricity and gas, the &euro;200 discount on people's electricity bill and a further fuel allowance payment.  That is just to give a few examples of what has being done since the budget.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, other measures will take effect before the budget in the autumn.  As the Deputy knows, the school clothing and footwear allowance will be available for those who are eligible for it.  We increased the funding for that significantly in recent years.  For those attending third level institutions, the increase in the SUSI grant will take effect alongside the fact more people will become eligible for it.  Those measures were announced in the budget but they will actually take effect over the course of the summer in terms of people going back to school and college.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, facing a big bill can often be the toughest thing for people.  People might be getting by week by week, but obviously, a big bill arriving can be a big difficulty for a family.  They might be getting by week to week but that big bill, whether it is for car repairs or back-to-school costs, can hit people very hard.  As I said, much has been done already with &euro;2.4 billion for families to help them with the cost of living.  There is more planned in the autumn in and around the budget.  We want a set of actions that will take effect almost immediately in the days and weeks after budget day to help people through the winter in particular.  A series of more regular moves will take effect then in January.  That is the plan on which we are doing much work at the moment.  As I said, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance will become available over the course of the summer as well as the improvements in the SUSI grant for those attending third level institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000017#T00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1656584400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I do not think that will be any comfort to that mother from Cork or, indeed, all the other families who face a summer of dread.

They do not know where they will get the money to pay for basic things like schoolbooks for their children or a school uniform to put on their kid's back come August.  I plead to the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of these individuals and many more like them that the Government needs to change tack and bring forward an emergency budget.

This is what we will see for the next year or two from Sinn F&eacute;in, and that is fine.  However, the Government has acted already.  We have acted since the budget and over the summer other measures will take effect, including pay increases for some people and in the public service, the back to school footwear allowance and the improvements in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant for third level.

That is because over 200 children still do not have a school place on the last day in June for the coming September term.  It was a privilege yesterday to be joined by parents, advocates, SNAs, teachers and young people for the debate on the Labour Party's Autism Bill 2022, which seeks to address the serious shortfall in provision for autistic people, both adults and children, who are simply without services.  We heard words such as \"hellish\" and \"a nightmare\" used by parents when describing their experiences in securing services for their children.  We have asked the Government to take urgent action on this.<\/p>  <p>  We were glad the Bill was not opposed yesterday on Second Stage.  What we want is what children and adults in other jurisdictions have as a matter of right, which is a national autism strategy to address provision in education, healthcare, employment and training.  We see it in Northern Ireland under the Autism Act 2011, in England under the Autism Act 2009 and in Malta which has a national autism empowerment strategy.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has been calling for this for some time.  Indeed, over a year ago, Labour Party Deputies put forward a motion to introduce a national autism empowerment strategy.  We were promised action on that within a year by the Government and we accepted that response.  We waited for longer than a year but, regrettably, over a year on we are still hearing the same experiences and frustrations.  We saw this frustration expressed in the report of the Ombudsman for Children, a damning report of Government failures in regard to children.<\/p>  <p>  We do not believe that anybody in the Government thinks that a 36-month waiting list for an assessment or intervention is acceptable or that it is acceptable that over 15,000 children are being bussed out of their local communities to access an appropriate or acceptable education.  We do not think it is acceptable that so many schools are lacking the wraparound additional supports that are needed to ensure a proper and adequate education for children with autism.  In recent weeks we see news headlines still being dominated by a lack of provision and lack of school places.  Worst of all, we see children who are still without a guarantee of a place in the autumn.  I know the Government's legislation is to be debated tomorrow, but it is too little, too late for those children and their families.  What we heard from the groups, advocates and parents who were with us yesterday in the Visitors Gallery was an urgent desire for the Government to take steps today to ensure that we are not back in the same place next year.<\/p>  <p>  What timeline does the Government have to ensure we are not back in this position next year?  What timeline does it have for addressing the serious shortfalls in provision for children and adults who are lacking the basic human rights they should have just because they are autistic?  Why are we still failing those children and adults?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000018#U00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1656585000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue again.  I emphasise that the Government is committed to ensuring that every child with special educational needs has access to an education.  One child who does not have a school place is one child too many.  We fundamentally believe that our most vulnerable children in society should be prioritised.  That is why the Government is introducing new legislation this week.<\/p>  <p>  The new Bill was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday and it will ensure that adequate provision of special educational needs placements is available for the coming year.  We have school placements for probably over 1 million children - those who have special needs and those who do not - this year in September, but there is a particular issue with approximately 100 children in the Dublin area for whom we do not have a place.  We are determined to make sure that a place is made available, and not at the last moment in late August or September.  We want to make sure that parents know they have a place for their child in the coming weeks.  That is the timeline we are working towards.  The new process will allow a ministerial direction to be served on a school within six to eight weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out its opinion that there are insufficient schools in a certain area.  Of course, we will endeavour to make sure that happens far more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's Bill, we very much welcome it as an important contribution to the debate on these issues.  I welcome the fact that the Labour Party is putting forward solutions.  It was discussed in the Cabinet during the week and the Government decided not to oppose it.

As I said, we heard yesterday from parents who are very frustrated.  In some cases they have had to approach 18 or 25 schools simply to try to get a place for their child and were still unable to do so.  Many parents in my constituency, Dublin Bay South, are at the end of their tether trying to secure places.  There is a pinch point at every stage - transition to primary school, transition into secondary school and leaving secondary school and going to college or training.  At all these points parents have to fight so hard that it becomes a consuming exercise in activism for many of them.  They should not have to fight for what should be basic rights for their children and young adults who are simply not getting the recognition and support they require in the State.<\/p>  <p>  We heard yesterday from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about the strategy she is developing, but it is not to be underpinned by legislation.

It is wrong that parents have to fight and struggle for a place in school for their children.  I met parents in Dublin 15 in my constituency who are in this position.  We managed to resolve it in our constituency in the vast majority of cases and I think we will resolve it very shortly.  There are things parents may have to fight for in life, but a place in a school should not be one of them.  I totally agree with the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the current position, I am told there are 80 children waiting for a place in a special class in Dublin who are not already in a mainstream setting.  Recent weeks have resulted in eight primary schools saying they will open special classes in the new school year.  This will reduce the number down to 56.  Further engagement is happening with schools at present.  That will continue intensively in the coming weeks with the intention of further reducing the number of children requiring a class placement.

Last Monday, a young man came to my office.  He is 27 years old and is married with two children.  He has been working, his wife is working and they have a mortgage.  Unfortunately, he had an accident and he is waiting for treatment.  He tried to continue to work but he had to give up the work five weeks ago.  He was getting some painkillers for the pain.  He was told when he was getting the injections that they would last up to six months.  The pain left him for five and a half weeks.  The prospect before him is 18 months waiting for an assessment.  Then he will have to wait another four years for surgery.  That is what he has been told by the hospital.  This young man cannot lift his children, he cannot drive and he can hardly walk.  That is his current position.  He is relying on his mother to bring him to the doctor and relies on his father to help around the house.  He has a mortgage to pay, which he is struggling to do.  This is not somebody who is looking for a handout or for something soft.<\/p>  <p>  This is what is happening with the services in the orthopaedic unit in Galway.  There are massive delays.

It is important that we get the health service right.  We need infrastructure, additional beds, additional staff - when I say \"staff\" I mean nurses - and functioning accident and emergency units.  We also need to put in place the necessary services our people deserve.  We need to dispense with these codes for public procurement and appraisals for every project we have to undertake.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is in the Chamber.  He has to take on board the fact that we cannot continue with the same processes, while the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is sitting beside him, is trying to improve services.

Notwithstanding the fact we probably have 1,000 more beds than we had two years ago, more staff in our health service than ever before, a bigger budget than ever before, and more doctors than ever before working in our health service, we are, essentially, running up an escalator that is coming down at us.

That has put us in a position that is not where we wanted or expected to be at this stage.<\/p>  <p>  We have an ambitious plan to reduce waiting lists that has been published.  The Minister for Health and I have been down the steps already with that plan.  It is a &euro;350 million plan to improve waiting times in 2022.  It is the biggest waiting list plan I have seen in my time in politics by quite a distance.  If it works, and a lot will depend on whether we get hit by serious waves of Covid, we should have fewer people on active waiting lists by the end of this year than at any point in the past five years.  I am not saying we will get there but it will be a huge achievement if we can get to the point, by the end of the year, where waiting lists will be at a five-year low.<\/p>  <p>  Every patient waiting more than six months for a high-volume procedure, which includes the vast majority of orthopaedic procedures, will be offered treatment through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this year.  The waiting list action plan identifies 15 high-volume procedures.  The commitment is made that anybody who is waiting more than six months and is clinically suitable can receive his or her care through the NTPF.  That fund has confirmed it has authorised offers of treatment to almost 7,000 people and has sufficient capacity to increase what it is doing by approximately 100% by September 2022, thereby offering treatment to all 75,000 patients who are waiting for these procedures by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000019#V00200","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1656585600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>There are plans to improve waiting lists and money is going into the system as if nothing else is happening.

To come to this conclusion, all we have to do is listen to any interview with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, or the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  A recent EUROSTAT report from the European Commission revealed that Ireland was the most expensive EU country when it comes to the cost of living.  Prices in Ireland were found to be a staggering 40% higher than the EU average in 2021 and matters have worsened significantly since then, as we all know.  The report also revealed that, astonishingly, the cost of housing in Ireland was 88.5% higher than the EU average and a staggering 88% higher for utility bills such as electricity and gas.  The average cost of food here was 17% higher than in the EU27 countries.  These are the figures we are talking about.  Milk, cheese and eggs were found to be an average of 25% higher in cost, fats and oils were 22% higher, while breads and cereals were typically 20% higher.<\/p>  <p>  Despite Ireland's crippling cost of living, the Government has failed to act in any meaningful way, although EU governments have taken many measures to cut back on excise duties.  The Rural Independent Group has tabled motions on this matter, as have other groups.  Last night, there was another vote on a Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  We also tabled a Private Members' motion last April asking the Government to axe the carbon tax, which would have the impact of putting approximately &euro;8,000 directly into every person's pocket and knocking ten cents off the price of a litre of fuel by 2030, but that was rejected.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has remained tone deaf on many issues, despite the people suffering.  As I said, the current cost-of-living crisis is financially crippling lower income earners, including pensioners, struggling mortgage holders and, of course, the unemployed.  It is also having a disproportionate impact on all residents and farmers throughout the country.  Research has shown the impact of the crisis on rural dwellers has been much higher.  We all know that from listening to people every day of the week.  Rural communities and farmers face crippling costs for feed, fertilisers and fuel, which has the potential to wipe out many viable farms.

It tells us the cost of living in Ireland is high and much higher than the European average.  That will not come as a surprise to anybody as it was well known already, but when we drill into the detail, the report tells a slightly more complex story.  There are countries where the cost of living is higher than Ireland's, including Norway, Switzerland and Iceland.  There are countries that are similar to us, for example, Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg, and there are countries where the cost of living is much lower than Ireland's, including Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania.<\/p> <p>What is sometimes missing from the analysis and commentary around the report is the acknowledgement that salaries and wages in Ireland are much higher than the European average.  They are 35% or 36% higher than the European average.  There is a correlation between high-pay, high-income countries with a high standard of living and higher costs and countries where there is low pay, low standards of living and costs are lower.  I would certainly prefer to aspire to be in that group of high-income northern European countries, even if it comes with higher prices, than to be a low-income, low-cost country.

We have reduced excise on diesel to the lowest allowed under European rules.  We have reduced excise on petrol by 20 cent.

There will an exclusion for luxury accommodation because we do not particularly want to control the rents of multimillionaires who are renting penthouses or luxury suites.<\/p><p>The need to control rents should be self-evident, as is the total failure of the Government to do so.  Rent pressure zones have failed spectacularly in controlling rents.  In the last decade, average rents have increased by more than 100%.  In the last year alone, they have gone up by 12%.  They have now reached truly obscene levels.  While they are going up literally every week, at the last count, the average rent in my area was &euro;2,200 and you would be lucky to find somewhere for that these days.  We should think about that.  That is impossible for the vast majority of working people.  Somebody on an average income would have to fork out approximately 70% of income to meet that rent.  Needless to say, great numbers of people simply cannot do that and are therefore being driven into homelessness.  The income of working people who go out, work hard and do all the right things is, at the end of the week, not even close to enough to pay these absolutely extortionate rents.  We have to do something about it.<\/p><p>By the way, this is also costing the State money.  We have no choice but to support people on lower incomes and to give them the housing assistance payment, lease arrangements and rental accommodation scheme payments but that is costing the State approximately &euro;1 billion a year, a figure that is also rising.  It is insanity.  The public, the taxpayer and the State are being absolutely crucified by these corporate landlords that are charging extortionate rents.  Ordinary people simply cannot afford them and many are driven into homelessness and absolutely desperate situations.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I raised the case of Anthony and Niamh, who are still homeless.  They have two children but the only thing they have been offered since they were made homelessness having been unable to find anywhere to rent after being evicted on the grounds of sale is one bedroom for them and their two children in a hostel in town when the two kids go to school in the Sallynoggin area.  One of the couple works in Bray and the other in Sallynoggin.  The only offer they got was one room for four people in a hostel in Gardiner Street.  It is shocking.  I am not exaggerating when I say I am dealing with approximately 12 cases of households, the vast majority of which comprise people who have kids and who are working, who are going to be in the same situation in the coming weeks.  It is absolutely shameful.  The high rents are directly contributing to this problem.<\/p><p>The Government will say that eventually supply will reduce rents.  That is absolute nonsense.  There is no evidence at all to suggest that.  Even when we had record levels of supply during the Celtic tiger period, rents did not go down but continued to rise, as did house prices.  When you look at what developers are building at the moment, you will see that extortionate rents are being charged for what is being supplied.  We have to do something about this.  It is obvious that we have to deliver public and affordable housing but another key part of addressing this crisis is to control and set rents, as is done in many other countries.  I very much doubt that the Government will agree with this but we will fight hard and campaign for the introduction of a proper rent control regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000023#Z00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1656588000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000023#Z00700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1656588000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000023#Z00800","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656588000,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1656588000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000023#Z01000","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1656588000,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000023#Z01100","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656588000,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656588000,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ar 1.09 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ar 1.53 p.m.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 1.09 p.m. and resumed at 1.53 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Remediation of Dwellings Damaged By the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022: Second Stage","time":1656588600,"counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000024#EE00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1656588600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p> The defective concrete block disaster has haunted lives in Donegal, Mayo and beyond for too long.  People who built and bought family homes to make a life in saw their dreams crumble around them.  Instead of a shelter from the storms of life, their homes became prisons.  With no help available, they turned to the State for support.  When that support was found wanting, they took their message directly to the Government through all routes available.  We have listened and heard it loud and clear.  The scheme that today&rsquo;s legislation underpins is a dramatic leap forward towards a 100% grant scheme.  I believe it goes a long way to address the fundamental concerns and needs of homeowners.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise homeowners' concerns and fears around the proposed enhanced scheme.  They feel their trust has been let down before.  I want to assure them here today that we are committed to making this scheme work and will continually strive to ensure it is improved where that is needed.  I said in August 2020 on my visit to Buncrana in Donegal that every scheme evolves, and I have no doubt this one will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The intense engagement with homeowner representatives over the past year has fundamentally reshaped this scheme for the better.  It is a scheme of State support that is unprecedented anywhere in the world.  It is the State stepping up, and rightly so, to help those who have found no other way forward.  It is a light at the end of a long tunnel for families trapped in crumbling homes.  Let us give this scheme a fair chance.  Let us put in place a solid framework that we can build on and get people&rsquo;s lives back on track.<\/p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the homeowners and their representatives who have engaged with this process through the working group, Oireachtas hearings, submissions to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and the expert group as well as frequent meetings of the homeowners' forum.  That work has shaped this scheme, and where agreement could not be reached, it always shone a bright light on issues.  I know they will continue to press their case and work for a scheme that delivers.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to acknowledge and thank John O&rsquo;Connor whom I appointed as the homeowners' liaison for his hard work and commitment to improving this scheme.  The immense progress we have made to date would not have been possible without his diligence.  I also thank in particular my Department officials who have worked so hard on this very complex and difficult issue.  In addition, I acknowledge my Government colleagues, particularly the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who is here beside me, Deputy Calleary and others, as well as Opposition representatives who have engaged with us through this process.  They have been tireless advocates publicly and more often behind the scenes to press the case for impacted homeowners, not just over the past year but over several years.  I note Deputy McHugh is here as well who has been of great assistance to us in this process also.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of the current defective concrete blocks grant scheme has proven to be challenging for all involved: homeowners, engineers, local authorities and the Department.  Difficulties with the consistent and appropriate application of the IS 465 standard, the financial barrier to scheme entry, the negotiated nature of the methodology by which the grant amount is determined, the significant number of judgment calls required of local authorities in what is a challenging local operating environment, and the adequacy of the grant amounts available were raised as significant issues.  It was clear there was a need to make changes to the administration of the scheme to ensure it is as simple as possible for all stakeholders while ensuring adequate cost control, good governance and, most importantly, good outcomes for homeowners.<\/p>  <p>  The draft Bill today follows on from the general scheme and reflects the decisions made by Government in November 2021 effectively to overhaul the previous grant scheme that was launched in January 2020.  I take this opportunity to draw attention to the key decisions and differences from the old scheme and highlight the major steps forward.<\/p>  <p>  In the new scheme, there is provision for 100% grants subject to an overall maximum grant of &euro;420,000 per dwelling.  This eliminates the mandatory 10% homeowner contribution under the old scheme and increases the cap from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000.  Grant rates are in keeping with the construction cost report prepared by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland such that no homeowner will receive less funding than the construction costs recommended by SCSI in its cost report.  This links the rates to an independent cost source to ensure they keep up to date with real construction costs, unlike the old scheme.<\/p> <p>The scheme includes a Government guarantee in respect of remediation works other than full demolition or rebuild, that is, options 2 to 5, through eligibility for a second grant, if required, for a period of 40 years.  That is a 40-year guarantee.  Neither of those measures existed in the old scheme.<\/p> <p> A revised application process will remove the financial barrier to scheme entry.  It will only require of the homeowner to submit an initial building condition assessment at minimal cost that is recoupable on entry to the scheme.  This removes the &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 entry costs in the old scheme.<\/p> <p> An independent appeals process for applicants is being introduced, with all key decisions under the scheme appealable by homeowners.  Again, this did not exist under the old scheme.<\/p> <p> The scheme will cover alternative accommodation and storage costs and immediate repair works to a maximum value of &euro;25,000 within the overall grant cap.  Again, this did not exist under the old scheme.<\/p> <p> Importantly, the Housing Agency is playing a key role under this enhanced scheme by taking on the financial cost of testing and assessing homes and determining on behalf of the local authorities the appropriate remediation option and the grant rate of each dwelling.  Again, this did not exist under the old scheme.<\/p> <p> There will be a damage threshold to ensure the worst-affected homes are remediated first.  I assure homeowners that this threshold will be set by regulations and kept under continuous review.<\/p> <p> The enhanced scheme will be extended beyond the current scope of principal private residences only to also cover rented dwellings registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, on or before 1 November 2021.  The old scheme was principal private residences only.<\/p> <p> The counties of Clare and Limerick will be included in the enhanced scheme upon commencement.  As all present are aware, the old scheme applied to Donegal and Mayo only.<\/p> <p> There will be a review as required of the overall grant cap and the grant rates, and adjustment, if necessary, by Government order, each year.  The old scheme had no review mechanisms or criteria in place.  There will be a review of the operation of the Act three years after its commencement.  There was no review built into the old scheme.<\/p> <p> Legislative provision is being made for Exchequer funding of local authority- and approved housing body-owned social homes that are affected.  This was not covered under the old scheme.<\/p> <p> Exempt development status under planning legislation will apply to remediation works carried out under the defective concrete blocks grant scheme on a like-for-like basis.  This was not covered under the old scheme.<\/p> <p> I wish to address legitimate concerns and some of the criticisms in respect of the Bill to try to dispel any uncertainty.  The Government decision on 30 November 2021 called for a number of reviews to be completed to ensure this disaster does not occur again and the core problems are addressed.  These included a review of the IS 465:2018 protocol, including consideration of the impact of other potential material such as pyrrhotite.  It called for a review of the adequacy or otherwise of the existing foundations in homes impacted by defective concrete blocks and a review of the potential impact, if any, of full cavity wall insulation on homes susceptible to damage or damaged by defective concrete blocks.  I wish to clarify that the Bill allows for the Minister to adjust, through regulations, any issues that arise from these scientific investigations.  I assure the House that if a problem is found with foundations or other issues through the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, that will be dealt with.<\/p> <p> Existing applicants under the current scheme will not be disadvantaged from being early movers and will benefit retrospectively from the increased grant amounts and allowances that will be available under the enhanced scheme.  Appropriate transitional provisions will be included in the new legislation to provide a mechanism to move applications to the revised scheme once it commences.<\/p> <p> I can confirm that the counties of Clare and Limerick have now been included in the enhanced scheme.  Given the possibility that the spread of impacted homes could be wider than the four counties currently accepted into the enhanced scheme, the extension of the scheme to other local authority areas was considered as part of the wider deliberations on the scheme by the Government.  I, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, may, with Government approval, extend the scheme to additional counties where the evidence supports such an extension.  Importantly, a pathway for the admittance of other local authority areas onto the scheme is now in place and it has worked for Clare and Limerick, as evidenced by their inclusion in the Bill.  I assure Deputies that my Department and I will deal promptly with any submissions received from other local authority areas that seek admittance to the scheme.  The Bill provides for me, as Minister, to introduce a scheme of grant assistance for local authorities and approved housing bodies to remediate social homes in their ownership that have been impacted by defective concrete blocks.<\/p> <p> The estimated overall cost of the enhancements to the scheme and the new scheme is &euro;2.7 billion, which includes some 7,500 homes across the State.  The additional costs reflect the construction costs as set out by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and inflation.  I reiterate that, each year, I or another Minister will be able to vary that rate on review without having to amend the legislation.<\/p> <p> The devastating impact of the crisis and scale of the State intervention demands that we ensure this never happens again.  In October, I ordered an audit of all active quarries in Donegal by the National Building Control Office arising from concerns over compliance.  On Tuesday, I received a copy of the report.  I am now reviewing it with a view to publication and ensuring its recommendations are carried out.  I will update the House on this matter as soon as I have concluded that review.  In addition, the NSAI has been tasked with undertaking a review of the Irish standard for concrete blocks, including aggregates, to ensure it is fit for purpose.  That work is now ongoing.  I will appoint a senior counsel to review the causes of the mica and pyrite disaster and make recommendations on the matter.  I expect to finalise terms of reference and appoint an experienced senior counsel in the coming months.  I will inform the House of progress in that regard.<\/p> <p> The clear goal of these measures is to draw a red line under this scandal and ensure no other properties are impacted in future.  I appreciate concerns in respect of the need to pass the Bill before the summer recess and I thank the Oireachtas joint committee for granting a pre-legislative waiver.  There has been extensive and intensive engagement with homeowner representatives and other key stakeholders on the defective concrete blocks issue through the past 12 months, including the working group on the defective concrete blocks grant scheme, which was established last June and reported in September 2021, following which the Government approved significant enhancements to the scheme.  The expert group on the enhanced scheme was chaired by Mr. Paul Forde, whom I thank for his work and for lending his extensive expertise, knowledge and experience to this process.  The expert group reported on a significant number of technical issues that needed to be considered and advised upon.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland prepared a construction cost report for remediation works under the scheme, the findings of which have been accepted in full by the Government and incorporated in the grant rates under the enhanced scheme, as I committed to do last year.  Account was taken of submissions from Engineers Ireland to my Department on the issue, as well as submissions by homeowners to my Department.  There was considerable ongoing engagement with homeowners through Mr. John O&rsquo;Connor, former chief executive of the Housing Agency, whom I appointed as homeowner liaison officer.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland engaged with a number of reviews relevant to the defective concrete blocks issue, and the Oireachtas joint committee held a special series of hearings on the legislation.<\/p> <p> The remediation scheme needs a legislative basis and, more important, it needs to get going.  We need to move forward with real progress and implement the scheme.  The Bill is a real step forward.  Every Deputy is keenly aware of the scale of the crisis that confronts us.  The scheme is the State stepping up to the mark as we have a moral obligation to put in place practical solutions for impacted homeowners.  We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we need to get a practical scheme moving.  I reiterate that the scheme will evolve in future and we will continually keep it under review.  We will continue to work closely with all Oireachtas Members and listen carefully to their views in this legislative process and in the operation of the scheme.<\/p> <p>I think we can all agree it is essential the Bill passes through all Stages in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad in a timely fashion and that the enhanced scheme can open for applications as soon as possible.  Homeowners have been on a long, hard and often lonely journey since cracks first appeared in their homes.  Today&rsquo;s Bill may not be the end of that journey but I believe it is the beginning of the end.  This Bill provides a clear pathway forward out of the nightmare that has haunted them for far too long.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000024#EE00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656589800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I welcome homeowners from Clare, Limerick, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal, who are in the Gallery today.  I commend all of them, and all affected homeowners, many of whom have been campaigning for a decade.  In particular, I commend them on the incredibly intense level of campaigning over the past 12 months, on the streets and on social media, and their engagement with the Minister and his officials, as well as the Opposition.<\/p><p>Having listened very carefully to the Minister, it is clear there is a growing gap between what he says he is doing and what is in the Bill and on offer to affected homeowners.  Many of us have been talking to those homeowners since the publication of the legislation over a week ago.  The emotions they are expressing to us are anger, frustration and a sense of being very badly let down.  They, and we, are deeply unhappy about the rushed nature of the legislation.  It has also been greatly delayed.  When I raised this point with the Minister last week on the floor of this House, he said it had not been delayed.  On 10 February, in the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I asked him for an update on the legislation and he said, &quot;I hope to publish the general scheme in March.&quot;  He went on to say, &quot;If we need amendments on Committee Stage, we can do that too.&quot;  When I raised the March deadline with some of his officials, they were surprised because they were working to a deadline of the end of April.  April then turned into May and May into the start of June.<\/p><p>Here we are with very important legislation, which every Member of this House wants to get right in the best interests of the homeowners, and we are being given an inadequate amount of time to ensure it is correct.  The accelerated pre-legislative scrutiny at committee was not ideal but that was a gesture of good faith on behalf of many of us to show we did not want to delay the process.  A Bill of this size and complexity getting just two hours of consideration on Committee Stage next week is a scandal.  The price tag for this Bill could go up to or maybe even exceed &euro;3 billion.  Two hours of debate is negligent, if not reckless.  In my considered view, and in the view of many others, this Bill is not right.<\/p><p>It would be very easy for the Minister to dismiss my views and those of my colleagues, or others in opposition.  What I want the Minister to do is listen very carefully to the words, not of other politicians but of the homeowners themselves.  First thing this morning, a joint statement was issued by the Donegal Mica Action Group, the Mayo Pyrite Action Group, the Clare Pyrite Action Group, the Limerick Pyrite Action Group and the Sligo Pyrite Action Group.  I urge the Minister and his Government colleagues to listen to what they had to say.  The statement reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe, the representatives of the homeowners, across Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and Sligo, would like to issue the following joint statement regarding the Defective Block bill scheduled to be debated in the Dail today.<br \/><br \/>It is imperative that the voice of the Homeowners, the victims of Defective materials, is heard and that [in particular] the Government TD&rsquo;s, those individuals that we have voted into office, listen before it is too late.<br \/><br \/>Listen, because to date, you have not listened.  We are angry, frustrated and the endless torture will not be tolerated to go on a minute further.<br \/><br \/>Over the past ten years, we have engaged endlessly with different government officials and government parties.  We have entered talks bringing with us our lived experience of this nightmare.  Arming each official with the practical solutions of what is needed on the ground to deliver a scheme that will rebuild our homes.<br \/><br \/>At each stage we have encountered obstacles.  We had been delivered a scheme that was so flawed it proved financially unviable, and practically unworkable to be of any use for impacted homeowners.<br \/><br \/>Last summer talks were entered into again with homeowner representatives from Mayo and Donegal (other impacted counties [including Clare, Limerick etc.] were excluded from this process), under Government pretense of forming a joint working committee, which would take on board homeowner input. The aim: a joint working effort that would design a Scheme that truly provided the 100% Redress, that the full Government supported on June 15th 2021.<br \/><br \/>Sadly, this was not to be the case.  Not because we homeowners did not engage but because the Dept of Housing Officials and Govt officials wasted 3 months defending their already debunked 90\/10 scheme.  When the Minister of Housing announced the scheme in November it showed &quot;Lessons had not been Learned&quot;.<br \/><br \/>Presented to the press was a trojan horse, that brought with it all the media spin the Department of Housing could throw at the public.  Spin that said it was indeed 100%, when it is not.  Spin around a figure of &euro;420,00 which very few will ever get.  Spin about the burden to taxpayers, when we are the very taxpayers who have been left to suffer in rotting homes, built with unregulated blocks.  Portraying us homeowners as greedy, as chancers.  Their indifference for the people in homes built with defective blocks quite evident through the schemes many clauses and trappings.<br \/><br \/>Not to be deterred or walk away, representatives again agreed to enter discussions with government representatives.  Our aim &ndash; to try and improve the new Scheme for a third time.  All areas were reviewed, and solutions provided to the additional problems created by the Department.  Solutions were presented for rental property and holiday home inclusion, an increase on the max grant available, inclusion of foundations, the controversial Damage Threshold assessment, to name a few.  Multiple weekly meetings over 6 months were held on the pretense of designing a Scheme that would work.<br \/><br \/>This bill was due to be different.  This engagement would be different from past experience.  We would work together to design a Scheme that truly provided the 100% Redress, that the full Government supported on June 15th 2021.<br \/><br \/>Last week we were due to see the fruits of our labor delivered.  A workable scheme that would enable the thousands of homeowners across 13 counties to move forward with their lives.  Instead, what was delivered over 60 pages was contempt for us homeowners, in the same week the Housing Committee heard quarries are still producing defective materials.  How can we [be expected to] trust a system which is not fit for purpose failing in its responsibility to protect victims, citizens, and taxpayers?  Threats of fines and imprisonment for innocent homeowners.  Minister nowhere mentioned were the equivalent fines or threats of imprisonment for the true perpetrators in this.  The producers of these defective blocks, including giants of the Irish ... [construction] Industry.<br \/><br \/>We have scaled every obstacle put in our way.  But it appears the government has strung us along for months.  Practically every suggestion and solution presented ignored by the Department of Housing and Housing Agency officials.  The voices and plight of the ordinary homeowners treated with cynical contempt by those with the power to do better by us.<br \/><br \/>Over the past week, and pressed to the wall we have worked around the clock to put forward 80 amendments to make this scheme work.  80 amendments because that are the number of failures in this bill.  We the homeowners are calling on you the elected TDs to listen carefully to the amendments [when they are put forward].  They have come from the insight and suffering over long years of those who know what it means to live in these homes.  The new Scheme will not work without these amendments.  By ignoring us again today, you are wasting more money, destroying more lives.<br \/><br \/>While we wait on the I[ndustry] S[tandard] 465 review which we need to include all deleterious materials scientifically proven to be problematic, along with foundations, you [Minister] must ensure for us, your electorate these amendments are made.  You must forget party politics and focus on what is best for your constituents no matter what their political allegiance and show the flexibility to be the change required to finally make this scheme work.<br \/><br \/>To date this government has broken all parliamentary process when trying to rush this scheme through the statutory legislative stages.  You have given us no time to review the bill, no time to debate the bill, no time to even communicate and discuss the consequences of the long-term aspects of the bill to the thousands of homeowners whose lives will be destroyed by not only defective blocks, but your failure to provide true redress for the problem. <br \/><br \/>Minister let us be [very] clear, so our words are not misunderstood.  If this bill is not amended, we the homeowners will not support it.  We will continue our campaign and protests until it is amended, until it is fit for purpose.  Fit for the citizens of this country who need to avail of it to fix their homes. It is not just our houses that this is destroying, but our daily lives, our working lives, our family lives, our physical and mental wellbeing, the very fabric of our communities.<br \/><br \/>Minister we will not give up. The time for engagement is over.  Amendments are needed.  It&rsquo;s time that your Government and its Dept of Housing listen and deliver what has been promised. <\/blockquote>  <p>That was signed by representatives of the homeowners across the affected counties.<\/p> <p>Those are not the words of a politician or words that can be dismissed as political opportunism; they are the words of individuals and families who are living in homes that are crumbling around them.  I urge the Minister to listen carefully to what the Opposition has to say to ensure we get this Bill correct.  Homeowners are telling us that the legislation is not fit for purpose and that it is defective.  They have drafted more than 80 amendments and asked Deputies to table them.  Many of us have done that and more.  The Minister needs to listen to what they are saying, to consider their amendments and to improve this Bill.<\/p> <p> I want to highlight a couple of key concerns, without prejudice to the others, that we will address next week.  This Bill does not provide 100% redress for the vast majority of homeowners.  Martina Hegarty from Mayo made an incredibly compelling case at the committee.  Many Members present heard her.  She lives in a modest family home in Mayo.  It is approximately 90 sq. m.  She estimates, on the basis of the information available today, that she may get a grant of &euro;169,000.  On the basis of the quotation that she has been given today, before factoring in inflation, the actual cost of full remediation and replacement, as per the grant scheme, could be as high as &euro;200,000.  She does not have the difference.  There is real fear in counties Mayo and Clare that if the damage threshold is based on the recommendations of the expert group, it will be particularly disadvantageous for those with pyrite, because the nature of cracking and damage manifestation is different.  If there is damage to a property, it should be on the scheme.  The damage threshold should only be about prioritising when those homes are worked on.  I urge the Minister to consider that point carefully.<\/p> <p> The formula for calculating the cost is deeply flawed.  Not only do we need updated figures from the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, in advance of the opening of the schemes, specific to the counties and regions affected, the terms of reference, which the SCSI had no hand or part in producing, need to be reviewed so that we get a 100% like for like replacement, not what is currently on offer.  While the 12-month review is welcome, the proposal for addressing cost inflation is capped at 10%.  What happens if inflation is above that?  Who picks up the tab under the scheme?  The homeowner.<\/p> <p> The exclusion of foundations is contrary to the science.  I welcome what the Minister said about the NSAI's work, but it has to be accelerated.  We cannot have a long gap between the opening of the scheme and that outcome.  The same has to be said of the more substantive review by NSAI of IS 465.  We were informed by officials that it will be delayed until the latter end of next year.  That could be nine to 12 months after the scheme is opened, which is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> One of the greatest admissions in the Bill is the fact that the downsizing option includes a penalty.  Going back to Martina Hegarty's case, if she cannot afford the extra &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to remediate and replace her home, surely she should be allowed to take the grant of &euro;160,000 or &euro;170,000 and, within the footprint of her existing home, build a home that is up to 20% smaller than the current one without any reduction in the grant?  That was an incredibly generous compromise by the homeowners.  We all expected something like that to be in the Bill.  Unfortunately, it is not here.  There are also concerns that homeowners will be denied demolition and rebuilding, even when that is the right option.  That is a function of the mistrust that has developed between homeowners and the State.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that does not happen.<\/p> <p> The definition of \"relevant dwelling\" in the legislation is far too restrictive.  Apartments, group homes, nursing homes and other properties are excluded.  Nobody in this House dispute that homes with families living in them, as owners or tenants, have to be the first priority, but I do not see why some pathway for the remediation of other forms of properties could not have been included under the scheme.<\/p> <p> I welcome the inclusion of social homes and the two pilots that we were told about, where the Minister's officials are working with AHBs and Donegal County Council.  Please do not allow these pilots to be slow and the subsequent roll-out of remediation for all affected public homes to be delayed.  Social housing tenants should not be left living in unsafe or crumbling buildings.<\/p> <p> The process involving the council and the Housing Agency, as outlined in the Bill, runs the risk of being slow and overly bureaucratic.  All Members know about the long delays in local authorities because of understaffing.  On a number of occasions, the timelines given for applicants and homeowners to respond are short compared with the more generous timelines for statutory agencies.  That balance has to be struck.  Even I was surprised by the large number of regulations that will be required by the Minister's officials.  They have much work to do between now and the end of the year.  I have the greatest respect for the efforts they make in this regard, but knowing how busy they are, I do not see how all those regulations will be drafted, approved by Government and laid before the House by the end of this year.  It is important for the Government to be as honest as it can with people about the timelines.  Given the delays we have had to date, anticipating further delays is not unreasonable.  Homeowners need to be told when the scheme will be open.<\/p> <p> There is much work to do on this Bill between now and the end of the D&aacute;il term.  We are committed to giving the Minister as much time as he needs and to making ourselves available as often as required to meet that deadline.  The select committee can meet as often as he needs next week.  We have discussed it and have made ourselves available.  That will not in any way delay the passage of the legislation by the recess.  I urge him to work with us on this; the homeowners urge him to work with them too.  They have made clear in their statement that if the Bill is not amended, they will not support it.  Of all the lines in their statement, the profundity of what they have said to us as legislators cannot go unrespected.<\/p> <p> I urge the Minister not to make the same mistakes as his predecessors.  Please do not put in place a defective scheme that does not work.  Do not prolong the misery and heartache for owners and tenants living in defective buildings.  Let us get it right this time.  The Business Committee met today.  The Government Chief Whip undertook to take back to the Government a sincere request from many of us to give us more than two or three hours next week.  There is no reason our committee could not meet for six to eight hours on Wednesday.  We will do that.  That will still allow the Minister to complete Report and Final Stages on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning and to then proceed to the Seanad.<\/p> <p> Going back to what I said earlier, given the impact this legislation will have on thousands of families, on all taxpayers, and the huge sum the Government will have to commit to undo the mistakes of industry and light-touch regulation in the past, the right thing to do is to give us the time on Wednesday to go through the 80 homeowners' amendments, to adequately consider them and to listen to the Minister's response and indication of willingness to take them away to be introduced in the Seanad.  Let us get this legislation right.  It would be a travesty of the highest order, having left families with two bad schemes, for a third scheme to repeat all of those mistakes.<\/p> <p>None of us is playing politics or trying to create any difficulties.  We want what the homeowners want, which is legislation and a remediation scheme that is right.  The ball is in the Minister's hands.  I ask that him to work with us, fix the Bill, pass the amendments, and give all of these homeowners and their neighbours the redress scheme they rightly deserve and so desperately need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000026#GG00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656591000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I will pick up from where Deputy &Oacute; Broin finished.  I absolutely agree that this is not about kicking it into next month, and certainly not next year because this issue is far too urgent for that.  It is about getting it right and we believe that we can get it right.  While I am not a member of the committee, I speak as someone who attends the Oireachtas Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The amendments the Labour Party will bring forward will be tabled in my name, and those in the Seanad will be in the name of my colleague Senator Rebecca Moynihan, the Labour Party housing spokesperson.  This is about getting it right.<\/p>  <p>  The families I speak to, including members of the Donegal diaspora who are resident and politically active in County Louth tell me that they want to get this right.  I speak on a daily basis to the affected residents in Donegal.  All the people I speak to frequently with my colleague, Councillor Martin Farren in Donegal, say that the residents of Donegal and Mayo, and the residents representing those affected in other counties including Clare, Limerick, Sligo and elsewhere, want to get this right and they have waited long enough.  There is now an urgency about getting this done and getting it right.  I certainly will provide my time to allow this to be done correctly and for adequate time to be given to consideration of important amendments.<\/p>  <p>  To be fair, the Minister does not want to make any excessive claims in respect of 100% redress.  The Labour Party wants to put on the record that it has always supported the campaigners' demands for 100% redress.  I will feed back to the Minister his opening lines when he said: \"The scheme that today&rsquo;s legislation underpins is a dramatic leap forward towards a 100% grant scheme.\"  While he did not make any excessive claims, he said that he believes \"it goes a long way to address the fundamental concerns and needs of homeowners\".  Undoubtedly, it is a better scheme than those originally proposed.  He has done some work with the campaigners, and we all have made proposals on how the schemes could be improved but it appears from correspondence that Members have received, and from the views expressed by different groups, that there is still some way to go.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a very small country, and we all know somebody who knows somebody affected by this disaster.  The Minister quite correctly pointed it out and described it as a disaster.  That is exactly what it has been.  The counties with the largest preponderance of mica-affected homes are Mayo and Donegal.  We are aware that homes are affected in Clare, Limerick, Sligo and elsewhere.  At the moment there is also a small number of homes that may be affected in County Louth, the precise extent of which has yet to be established.  The Minister said the scheme may evolve in time and will have the capacity to include other counties if the need arises because the full extent of this is not fully known.<\/p>  <p>  When it is concluded and it is improved, the scheme needs to be agile enough to be able to respond to issues as they arise.  This crisis has touched people throughout the State.  Even if one is not an affected homeowner, one's heart breaks for those who are affected.  Building or buying a home is the biggest investment a person makes in his or her life.  It is a place that one calls home and, as many have done, it may also be the place that one took pride in building oneself.  A home may also be the place where people raise their kids.  It may have been found to be dangerously unsafe, crumbling before the family's eyes, and parts of it may have already fallen away.  It is a daily nightmare, and the stress and the insecurity must, frankly, be unimaginable.<\/p>  <p>  Today is not the day for history lessons.  It is a day for looking forward and doing our best for the people we all seek to represent.  It is about getting on with the job for the people who desperately need our help but it is about getting it right too.  There is still, however, a noisy bunch of ideologues and ideologically-driven commentators, who believe there should be less regulation of business and industry, fewer standards and less enforcement.  They say: \"Let us get rid of the red tape and all of that nonsense.\"  I put it to them that they should sit down with the affected families in Inishowen, or anywhere else in the State, who have been affected and who are now paying the price for poor regulation and the absence of laws and enforcement.  This is not an abstract issue.  If a person believes that because they are not living in mica-affected home and it does not affect them, then he or she is thinking incorrectly.  We all pay in the end for a lack of regulation.  The taxpayers and citizens across the country need to know that the bill for a lack of regulation or poor enforcement, be it in construction or in the banks, always falls on them.<\/p>  <p>  It is not just about mica; there is a pattern.  For example, we have seen thousands of lives fall apart due to structural defaults and fire defects in apartments.  This is another legacy of the Wild West era of \"Whatever you're having yourself, sure it'll be grand.\"  As with many other Members in this House, I have worked closely with the Construction Defects Alliance.  I do not wish in any way to confuse the two issues, but we do need to see action in budget 2023 with practical supports given to the owners of between 60,000 and 100,000 affected apartments who are covered by the Construction Defects Alliance campaign.  The longer this goes on unresolved and the longer that people put off doing the remediation work that needs to be done to make these homes safer, the more unsafe they will be and the more uncertainty prevails.  It would be useful if the Minister in his closing remarks, if he feels it is appropriate in the context of the debate will tell us what we can expect to see with regard to the Construction Defects Alliance campaign in the budget in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  There is an onus on the Oireachtas to atone for the grievous mistakes of the recent past and to put our words into real action.  The Bill and the scheme will need to be right this time for all affected homeowners, now and into the future.  I discussed this with my Labour Party comrade, Councillor Martin Farren in County Donegal, earlier today.  he pointed out some issues with the Bill and the scheme as it is currently presented, and some amendments that could be made to improve the operation of the scheme.  There are many amendments that we will all table for discussion next week and we need time to be able to do that.  First and foremost, we need to get this right and when we do, we need to move on this as soon as possible, especially for owner-occupiers.  They need to be at the front of our minds.  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin correctly articulated, there is an absence of trust and a lack of confidence in the process, which is understandable, given the experience of families and campaign groups to date.  Those families need certainty and people need to be confident that the State will not just support them to the end but listen to the genuine concerns at the moment.  Currently, there is a lack of confidence arising from the direct experience.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, while I am not a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I take an interest in the conduct of the affairs of the committee.  I am aware of the concerns of the joint committee members that have been expressed, which were articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier.  It is important that these concerns are understood and appreciated by the Minister and his officials because I believe these will form the bulk of many of the amendments we expect to deal with next week.  Under head 14, for example, it must be the case that updated SCSI reports on costs should be obtained with regard to the inflation factor.  We simply do not know where construction inflation will settle.  Under head 15, the issue of foundations simply must also be addressed, and they have to be included.  On the matter of whether there might be unsafe levels of mica in the foundations, it is surely as plain as the nose on one's face that this must be established before any work commences.  It must be covered by the scheme in its entirety.  It is not too much to ask that heads could be put together to have a robust testing and certification scheme in place before any remediation work, which could cost up to &euro;400,000, would commence.  Under head 21, it should be self-evident that any appeals process would be independent of all the statutory actors.  That makes sense.  Natural justice insists that this would be the case, and public confidence demands it.<\/p>  <p>  I am also attracted to the argument from a Mayo mica campaigner that a homeowner may be prepared to downsize to rebuild a smaller home within the full amount of the mica redress grant rather than having to build the exact same larger and costlier home.  This proposal has merit and should be permitted, with the necessary checks and balances put in place.  This makes environmental sense too with regard to the life cycle and it makes sense on every level that people should be permitted to downsize where it is appropriate, with checks and balances in place.  There should be no downsizing penalty.<\/p>  <p>  Some consideration could also be given to a fair grant scheme to allow for an award to be paid retrospectively where a homeowner may have had to carry our remediation work well in advance of the prospect of any remediation scheme being put in place.<\/p> <p>It is reasonable and fair to request such an approach.  There are genuinely grave concerns on the grant amounts for house size.  As it stands, it seems that many of the affected families and homeowners may not be able to avail of the scheme to remediate their home and this as to be addressed in the end. Likewise, there are legitimate concerns that the cost of rebuilding mica homes under the proposed scheme would leave many homeowners tens of thousands of euro out of pocket.     <\/p> <p> These arguments have been made in good faith by the people who presented to the committee and who have been in contact with all of us as Deputies and they should not be misconstrued as an attempt to unduly benefit from the scheme as some, though not the Minister, may have put it.  The Government report undertaken by the SCSI did note these concerns, yet one witness at the committee noted that we still have some affected homeowners, victims who have had their lives put on hold, being treated as &ldquo;chancers&rdquo; when making claims.  That sort of experience should be informative for us.  The committee also heard the case of Martina Hegarty from Mayo, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin alluded to.  Although hers is one of the smallest houses eligible under the scheme, she said she will still be left with a minimum of &euro;50,000 shortfall under the proposed framework.  <\/p> <p> Residents in County Donegal tell us all the time that they want to get this right but they want to make sure that owner-occupiers are prioritised.  These are people who are paying their mortgages, who live there and have no other interests anywhere else; that is their family home.  Some, not all, have a sense that they are being held to ransom by others who may be investors in properties in the county looking for the best possible deal.  That is something I have picked up on but I am not saying that is the general view.  It is understandable that owner-occupiers want the right scheme in place as soon as possible, so they can proceed and they should not be held back by what they might describe as ephemeral concerns that are being expressed under the radar by others.  The Minister may be aware of those concerns but I want to put that on the record because the ordinary homeowner is the priority here.  To be fair, the landlord who is on the RTB register, who is doing things legitimately and where someone is living in that house, should also be prioritised.  That is why the scheme needs to be up and running as soon as possible with owner-occupiers prioritised. <\/p> <p> The Minister set out the financial cost to the State of the scheme  His analysis is that it would cost approximately &euro;2.7 billion, which is not an insignificant amount by any stretch of the imagination.  The State has no choice other than to step in and address the issues in this Republic for taxpayers and for citizens because of the absence of regulation under the watch of the Oireachtas over recent times.  This is not a long history; it happened in the recent past.  Recently, I outlined how a reformed bank levy could assist in providing the resources that we need to address the cost demands in the context of this scheme and other schemes that may arise.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned accountability and holding those who are ultimately responsible for this to account.  We need to hear more about that.  Legal proceedings are being launched by some of the affected homeowners against those they deem responsible for this disaster.  Some form of assistance should be provided to them by the State.  The NSAI, and county councils may well be joined in those actions.  Ultimately, they are agencies of the State and they are accountable and responsible, and in the case of State agencies, they are responsible to the Minister who, in turn, is responsible to the House.  <\/p> <p> We need to make sure that this never happens again.  That is why this House needs to make a determined effort and the Government needs to learn from this and ensure that regulation is key and regulation and enforcement is implemented properly and to the standard that would be expected in a developed wealthy Republic.  <\/p> <p> Let us take the builders' register.  Industry interests are essentially policing themselves again.  Do we ever learn?   If we cannot learn from the mica scandal, something that has come at huge expense to many thousands of families across the country, not only financially but also emotionally, psychologically and materially, then when will we ever learn?  I cannot say that these mistakes or issues will never arise again.  Legislation is going through these Houses and there is a proposal that will soon find its way into law where we will have a builders' register that will effectively still be regulated by the representative body for builders in this country.  That is bizarre and does not stand up to scrutiny.  The Minister knows my view on this and that of many Opposition Members.  That is not a sustainable position.<\/p> <p> The suppliers of defective blocks must be held to account.  What committee members heard last week regarding the operation of quarries needs to be investigated and properly interrogated.  Higher standards need to be put at the centre of our approach to this in the future.  Lessons must be learned. <\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister again to work with us to give more time to take amendments next week and, indeed, the week after.  I have said many times in the House and in the media that such is the challenge around the cost of living that we cannot wait until October, or it seems now late September, for a budget we need it now.  Myself and my Labour Party colleagues are prepared for the House to sit longer.  I cannot speak for other Members of the Opposition but I know that we are all determined to get this right.  We are prepared to sit ain committee and I know the Seanad would also be prepared to sit longer if it meant getting this right and concluding this difficult journey in the right way.  We all know what we need to do and the Minister needs to enable us to get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000028#JJ00200","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656591600,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I welcome an important step in this legislation coming before the House.  It is a crucial step in ensuring that homeowners in my own county and many other counties can get their lives back on track and try to remove themselves from the nightmare that they have been living for well over a decade.<\/p>  <p>  Like every other person in Donegal, I have neighbours, family and friends affected.  If someone is not affected, he or she has a brother or sister, mother or father, or a son or daughter affected.  That is how pervasive, unfortunately, this disaster is in my home county, particularly in the northern half.  Unfortunately, it has affected every family in the county.  It has impacted their mental and physical health, the lives of children as they have grown up and marriages.  It has put an immense strain on family life and on people being able to live a normal life.  That is why it is so crucial that we get a scheme in place that will work for families and deliver the support they need to get their homes fixed.  <\/p>  <p>  I first visited a home impacted by this in late 2013 and I campaigned in opposition to get a scheme in place in as timely a manner as possible.  Since gaining the privilege to work as a Cabinet Minister, following my appointment to Government, I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Taoiseach and party leaders, Government colleagues and constituency colleagues from all parties to progress a Bill and to try to bring it forward as quickly as possible.  I want to recognise the work of everyone who has contributed to that.  I recognise the support of the Taoiseach who visited the county and put in place a working group following on from that to fully examine the issues at play and the tremendous role of the Minister in leading out on this and bringing the legislation together working with his team, including John O'Connor, Kevin Dillon, all his officials and the Office of the Attorney General.  I want to particularly recognise the role of homeowners and the work that they have done while living what should have been a normal life in trying to get this issue addressed and fixed.  I thank those involved in the working group.<\/p> <p>I welcome those who are here today.  It is far from the first day that many people have been outside the House, in the D&aacute;il or in this city on this issue.  I commend the work put in by Michael Doherty, Paddy Diver, Eileen Doherty and Ann Owens in the working group that was established.  I commend the work and leadership of the Mica Action Group under the chairmanship of Eamon Jackson in Donegal and Martina Hegarty in Mayo.  That is what it has got to get us to this stage.<\/p> <p> There are 50 pages of legislation here and the Bill was published over a week ago.  I have done all I can working within Government to try to get to the stage where it delivers an entirely different scheme, with an entirely different level of support, from the scheme that was there previously.  The work the committee did last week was important and the examination and the consideration of the D&aacute;il and Seanad will be important.  I recognise and welcome the support across the D&aacute;il to get this legislation passed by the summer recess.  I note the unanimous support of the housing committee last week.  I welcome that the committee structured its examination to ensure that would be possible.  It will be important to have further engagement with the Business Committee to try to provide as much time as we can for this before the recess.  I know several Bills are coming through the D&aacute;il over the next two weeks and we have a very heavy schedule.  However, as much time as possible should be provided to this Bill.  It is important that the amendments being submitted today are given consideration and reflected upon.<\/p> <p> This is an entirely different scheme from what was in place previously.  It is based on independent assessments and costings provided by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland based on up-to-date building costs as recently as March.  It has a cap of &euro;420,000 versus the previous cap of &euro;275,000.  Unlike the pyrite scheme on the east coast, it facilitates rental properties - one rental property per owner.  Unlike the previous scheme, the new scheme provides &euro;15,000 for accommodation and &euro;5,000 for storage.  When the scheme is enacted, an application will cost &euro;500 as opposed to the &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 that homeowners had to find upfront previously.<\/p> <p> More work remains to be done.  The regulations will be important.  I look forward to working with the Minister and colleagues to ensure those are brought forward as quickly as possible.  We need to consider the outstanding issues to be addressed in the legislation or regulations, for example, flexibility on downsizing.  Also important is the National Standards Authority of Ireland's work on the new deleterious materials that have emerged such as pyrrhotite and other sulphurs.  Information needs to be provided as quickly as possible so that scientific advice is available to the Government to ensure the scheme can be updated and the science follows.<\/p> <p> In the interim period, we need enhanced engagement between the Department, Donegal County Council and other local authorities to ensure as many as possible of the applications in train can move on and that as many houses as possible can be fixed as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> I again thank everyone involved in getting us to this stage.  More work remains to be done, but we are in a strong place now and that is thanks to the engagement of homeowners and everyone coming together to do this.  It is important now to step it out and take on board the views of all in the House who recognise the importance of ensuring this Bill, providing for the scheme, is passed before the summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000029#KK00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656592200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>All of us in this House have made the choice to put ourselves before the public and become public representatives.  We have made choices to make political decisions.  The people in the Gallery, those with houses affected by pyrite, did not make choices to be political.  However, they have been forced into this by the consequence of what has happened to them.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Bill the Minister has brought before us today does not deal with the matter sufficiently.  He heard the testimony from the people in Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Limerick and Clare.  They have been left with a shortfall of between 20% and 30% to rebuild their homes which are falling in pieces around them.<\/p>  <p>  It is disappointing for them and it is disappointing for the country that we are in this predicament.  All of us pay taxes.  The Government is about having a safety net for people.  When they are in trouble and their backs are to the wall, they need to have somebody to back them up and that is the Government they elect.  That should be there as a last port of call.  The Minister is letting them down here.  That is very clear from the testimonies that have been read out today.<\/p>  <p>  Some 80 amendments to the Bill have been tabled.  We often have many amendments to Bills before the House, but to have 80 is a reflection of how deficient this legislation is in delivering for the people across all these areas and indeed other counties that may yet be affected.<\/p>  <p>  An abundance of houses in my constituency in County Sligo have the same problem.  Homeowners have applied to the local authority and to date they have not been approved for the scheme.  We need a process to ensure they are accommodated quickly.  It is not just in these counties because, as we know, county boundaries do not have some kind of limits that materials cannot cross.  There are no checkpoints at county boundaries to see if deficient materials are crossing into other counties.  It is quite clear that many counties around the country will have the same problem with deficient materials.<\/p>  <p>  We need to ensure this scheme works for everyone everywhere who finds themselves in this situation.  We need to ensure priority is given to people who are owner occupiers, people who are renting houses in this situation, but also others as has been said.  Nursing homes and various other public buildings will have the same problem and this scheme does not address those.  It is very clear that this scheme is deficient and the Minister needs to accept that.  He needs to make the space to accept all the amendments that have been tabled by various Deputies.  He needs to ensure time is given to get the legislation to work.<\/p>  <p>  What we have is simply wrong.  We have left and right in this Chamber but we also have right and wrong in it.  It is wrong that people would be wronged in this way and left with homes crumbling around them.  The Government is not stepping up to the mark adequately to provide for their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000030#LL00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1656592200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and a member of the Business Committee.  My understanding from the discussion at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is that the members of the committee are more than happy to meet next week for six, seven, eight or nine hours, or however long it takes to go through these amendments in detail and scrutinise them to ensure we can get the best Bill possible.  Members of the committee will make themselves available to do that.<\/p><p>That proposal was discussed at this morning's meeting of the Business Committee.  No one present made any objection to it.  There was a very strong view from many of the groups and parties represented there that enough time should be allowed next week to go through the amendments.  The Government Chief Whip committed to check with the Department and the Minister to see if that would be acceptable.  We can meet next week for six, seven, eight or nine hours, or however long it takes to discuss the amendments properly to ensure we get the best Bill possible.<\/p><p>All we need is for the Minister to okay that proposal.  I urge him to do so because if he approves it, we will give the six, seven, eight or nine hours needed next week at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to go through the Bill in detail and discuss all the amendments.  I urge the Minister to give the green light so that we can do this Bill justice.  Considerable work has gone into it.  It is important that we get it right and do not fall short because of time at this stage.  It is entirely down to the Minister to give it the okay.  There are no objections from any other quarters that I am aware of.<\/p><p>In discussing this Bill, I want to recall the recent words of our President, Michael D. Higgins, who stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere is a powerful word.  Home.  Home.  Home is about the about the outpouring of intimacies and emotions.  Sometimes it is only a very simple thing but it is where personalities are developed, where relationships with others are developed.  It is a place to come back to, a place to depart from. <\/blockquote>  <p>When we talk about this Bill and defective blocks and we talk about crumbling buildings, we are talking about the place where families seek shelter and refuge.<\/p> <p>They invest their lives and emotions to create a home.  It is more than a building.  When the place people call their home and their refuge becomes unsafe, and they have no place to return to to escape that stress, it creates huge pressure and puts people under immense pressure.  We have all the fallout from that, including mental health problems and everything else that other Deputies and Ministers have spoken about.<br\/><br\/>The Government is bringing forward a Bill for a remediation scheme that in its estimation will cost &euro;2.75 billion.  There are four things we should expect from it at the very least.  They are that there would be proper scrutiny of the Bill and every effort would be made to recover costs and go after those who are responsible.  We should expect that not a single quarry would continue to operate that is producing substandard materials that lead to people's homes crumbling.  We should also expect that every measure necessary is put in place to ensure this never ever happens again.  That is not too much for anyone to expect.<br\/><br\/>The Minister can change the way we are scrutinising the Bill.  As we speak, only two hours is being allotted next week for Committee and Remaining Stages, which means we will not be able to give it the scrutiny and put forward proposals to improve and change the Bill if needed, or to hear the Minister's response.  The deadline for amendments was 11 a.m. today, before we even began Second Stage, which is not following proper process.  There is the use of the guillotine and the legislation is being rammed through in a way that is utterly unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>There is a pattern developing with this Minister.  When legislation is not contentious, such as the first parts of the electoral reform legislation, where we saw much consensus, we are given ample time to discuss it on Committee Stage and go through different amendments.  When it comes to complex and contentious legislation, or legislation that needs proper and detailed scrutiny, we see the time allowed for discussion shoehorned into an impossible slot to give it proper attention.  We know from previous experience that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  I appeal to the Minister again on this.  Only one person can remove the obstacles to the housing committee having nine hours or whatever amount of time it takes next week to go through the Bill on Committee Stage, and that is the Minister.  I appeal to him to agree to that proposal because nobody else has objected to it.<br\/><br\/>The timelines imposed mean affected homeowners have not had a chance to study the Bill in detail, make suggestions and give the feedback they would like.  We heard the statements before from affected homeowners, who engaged over the past year or number of months in good faith, working in detail through different issues.  They are deeply concerned, disappointed and very frustrated that the work they have done is not reflected in this Bill.  In fairness, they put their hearts and souls into the process.<br\/><br\/>We should expect the Government, if the Bill looks to do everything possible, to hold those responsible for this problem to account.  The Government must hold big industry that is responsible for this disaster to account.  The full cost of the remediation must be recovered.  The Minister has been vocal on the issue of recovering costs and made plenty of statements about it but we still have not seen anything done.  Some large Irish construction companies are currently contributing to the UK redress schemes arising out of the issues relating to cladding at Grenfell Tower and the disaster there.  The equivalent company is not being held to account in Ireland at this point.<br\/><br\/>It is very important measures do not punish the entire sector because that would punish people who have complied with all the standards.  This must be about holding to account those who are responsible.  That is really important if we are to have accountability built into this process.<br\/><br\/>We learned at last Thursday's meeting of the housing committee - and the Minister repeated it in his opening comments - that the Government &quot;intends&quot; to do something about this and there is an intention to appoint a senior counsel to look into cost recovery.  Incredibly, terms of reference for this work have still not been drawn up and nobody has, as of now, been appointed.  There is an urgency in this because the Statute of Limitations will kick in and prevent action being taken after a certain period.  There is a ten-year window and it will start to kick in with some aspects quite soon.  That tells us everything we need to know about the level of urgency the Government is showing to recovering costs from those who are responsible.<br\/><br\/>The Government has been negligent with respect to rogue quarries that are still operating.  We were told in last Thursday's meeting of the housing committee by Mr. Aidan O'Connell, an experienced and qualified engineer, about such quarries.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe have experience of 12 counties where we have seen damage.  As of last week, we are now on county 13.  That was a substantial amount of properties to be inspecting, reviewing and so forth.  One of the difficulties we are having, and I understand this is a public forum, is that the quarry owners recognise they have a problem and are suppressing some of the information and some of the damage and doing side deals with homeowners to try to suppress it within the counties.  Ultimately, I believe where all these locations are will come out.<br \/><br \/>I encourage people and Deputies who have knowledge of affected quarries, because I am aware of some areas in the southern part of Ireland and on the south-east coast where there are affected properties and they probably are well aware of where that material has come from, to come forward and give that information to the National Standards Authority of Ireland or Engineers Ireland. <\/blockquote> <p>He continued:<\/p><blockquote>\tI do know certain quarries that are still producing concrete blocks and material that is wholly unsatisfactory and they continue to do it knowing that material is still wholly unsatisfactory.  I believe that some TDs and other public personnel do know that themselves and I would encourage them to try to use any of their authority to get it stopped. <\/blockquote> <p>That is an incredible statement and, to be frank, I am very disappointed the Minister did not address the matter in his opening remarks.  He said he had ordered an audit of all active quarries in Donegal but what about the other quarries that we know, as of last Thursday, are operating around the country?  I have been in touch, as I know others have, with the National Building Control Office about this, urging it to act.  Why is the Minister not acting on this and why did he not address the question in his opening remarks?  Why are quarries still operating and producing substandard material leading to crumbling houses, putting families and communities through all that stress?  What is the Minister doing about this and why are we not hearing from him about action?  Everybody in Ireland deserves to hear from the Minister about what is being done about these quarries, which are still operating.  It is utterly unacceptable that the Minister with responsibility for this had nothing to say about it in his opening comments today.  I urge him to address the question in his closing statement.<br\/><br\/>If this is not to happen again, there are four actions the Government should take as a matter of urgency.  We need a national building control authority along the lines of the National Food Safety Authority of Ireland and we must make the inspection and certification of building and development properly independent to completely break the self-certification model that has been an absolute disaster.  We must introduce latent defects insurance, although the Government opposed my recent amendments in legislation to do this.  We need an independent regulator of the building industry rather than one run by the building industry, which is what is being done.  Given the huge costs, stress and trauma caused by building defects and defective blocks, it is inexcusable that these measures have not been taken already.<br\/><br\/>I will touch on the assignment and subrogation of claims to the Minister, dealt with in section 29.  This means homeowners will not be able to take legal actions if they sign up to the State's redress scheme.  We know that so far, 34 High Court writs have been issued and hundreds more could be expected.  Would it not be in the State's interest to allow homeowners to recover costs against third parties, especially for non-grantable losses or any of the costs of construction or remediation not covered by this scheme?  It appears this section of the Bill will prevent homeowners from recovering those costs through legal action.<\/p>  <p>We need to know on what basis the State purports to inherit a plaintiff's rights to recover sums that are not covered by the grants for which third parties could otherwise be liable.  I asked officials from the Department about this at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last Thursday.  We were promised an answer but I have not received one.  This is one of the problems with rushing this legislation through in that we raise legitimate questions, as we are meant to do as part of the democratic process, and we do not get answers.  That is a deficit in this process.<\/p> <p> Does blocking these legal actions mean that people who are not covered under the scheme could end up taking a legal case and get financial recourse for thousands of other homeowners?  Last week, representatives of the affected homeowners informed the committee that they felt this part of the legislation was designed to put the frighteners on them and stop people pursuing a claim against anyone.  While there were measures in the Bill to prevent affected homeowners from taking from legal action, there are no such measures with respect to taking on those who are responsible for this disaster.<\/p> <p> Previous speakers mentioned the option of penalty-free downsizing.  This is a very good proposal, which has been put forward as a compromise by affected homeowners.  Again, we have not heard a good explanation of the reason it is not being provided for.  This option makes sense given the environmental benefits it would have in terms of reduced building materials and less energy to heat homes.  As such, it is in line with Government policy to tackle climate change.  I ask the Government to consider allowing penalty-free downsizing and flexibility.  It makes eminent sense to do so.<\/p> <p> On the damage threshold, there is a concern that this will potentially exclude and delay thousands of homeowners in pyrite-impacted counties.  The reliance on visual inspections and assessment of photographs will mean some homeowners will be excluded and core testing will only apply if owners pass the damage threshold.  Concerns were articulated last week that this could mean that homeowners who have understandably taken some small measures to prevent additional water egress and the damage that causes may not meet the damage threshold as a result of the very small measures they have taken.<\/p> <p> A scientific and evidence-based approach should be taken and should rely on core testing.  This a line that is worth repeating.  I do not think there is anything controversial about taking that approach.  Why then is that approach not being taken and why are we not relying on core testing for assessing the damage threshold?<\/p> <p> There are a number of other issues with this Bill and I and other Deputies have submitted a large number of amendments to it.  I have concerns that the revised rates and caps are not in line with forecast inflation and that the proposals on cost inflation in the Bill are inadequate.  I also have concerns that the approach taken is not following the science and does not ensure all deleterious materials are assessed and the foundations are tested.<\/p> <p> We were told last Thursday at the housing committee that the Housing Agency, for example, has not done any testing of foundations in Donegal.  Why is it that the case?  Why is there an aversion to taking a scientific and evidence-based approach to that?  Why are we not taking an approach that would mean that no defective concrete block homeowner is left behind?<\/p> <p> I am concerned that the approval process is complex and has so many stages that it will not be user-friendly.  We have to think of this in terms of the stress and trauma that homeowners have already gone through.  Making those processes more difficult for them does not help.<\/p> <p> There are also concerns about the power and discretion being placed in the hands of the Minister in setting regulations without scrutiny.  There are concerns that the 18-month time limit may cause issues with accessing contractors and builders, especially in areas of high demand.  <\/p> <p> It is very important that we get this legislation right.  Rushing it does not help at all in that regard.  There must be accountability and recovery of costs from those who are responsible.  The lack of action on that to date is utterly unforgivable.  The rogue quarries producing substandard materials which are damaging homes and lives to this day need to be shut down and dealt with.  It is completely unacceptable that the Government is not acting on that.  There needs to be action now to ensure the construction sector is independently and robustly regulated to ensure issues like this never arise again.  The passage through the Houses of the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 means the sector will not be independently regulated but will regulate itself.  It is incredible, after everything that has happened in this country, that the Government would do that.<\/p> <p> I agree with the comments of Deputy Nash on the proposal from the Construction Defects Alliance.  We need to see action on that in this year&rsquo;s budget and I hope that the Minister will address the matter in his concluding remarks.<\/p> <p> I reiterate that the House could give this Bill the justice and scrutiny it deserves and the time needed for the amendments if one person, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, were to facilitate and agree to that.  Nobody else has objected to the suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000030#LL00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656593400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this important legislation.  The life-changing discovery by so many householders in County Clare of the presence of pyrite in their homes in recent years has exposed the fundamental flaw in the previous scheme, namely, that households in County Clare were simply excluded and had no access to grant aid and nowhere to turn for redress.  The establishment of the Clare Pyrite Action Group by Dr. Martina Cleary in September 2020 has led to the welcome Government decision of 14 June 2022 to include County Clare in the new scheme we are debating today.  <\/p><p>Affected householders in County Clare have travelled a long road to get to this point.  I pay tribute to the sustained campaign of the Clare Pyrite Action Group led by its chairperson, Dr. Martina Cleary, and the vice-chairperson, Mary Hanley, working together with the director of services of Clare County Council, Anne Haugh, and her team of Siobh&aacute;n McNulty and Tony Neville, together with expert engineer, Simon Beale.  I also want to mention the great work of the <i>The Clare Champion<\/i>journalist, Fiona McGarry, who has covered this issue extensively over the past number of years.  <\/p><p>The Clare Pyrite Action Group has identified 1,025 potentially impacted private homes, 17 private housing estates, five local authority housing estates and 11 large-scale public and private dwellings.  I strongly believe this is a conservative estimate and many more affected homeowners will come forward given that County Clare is now eligible for this scheme.<\/p> <p>The headline aspects of the new Bill are welcome and include the increase in the maximum grant available going from &euro;275,000 up to &euro;420,00 per dwelling; grant rates in keeping with the construction cost report prepared by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland; a Government guarantee regarding remediation works other than full demolition and rebuild, that is, options 2 to 5, through eligibility for a second grant, if required, for a period of 40 years; the introduction of an independent appeals process for applicants, with all key decisions under the scheme appealable by homeowners; alternative accommodation, storage costs and immediate repair works to a maximum value of &euro;25,000; the Housing Agency playing a key role under the enhanced scheme by taking on the financial cost of testing and assessing homes and determining on behalf of the local authorities the appropriate remediation option and grant rate for each dwelling; the extension of the enhanced scheme beyond the current scope of the principal private residence only to cover rented dwellings registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB; and exempted development status under the planning legislation for remediation works carried out under the defective concrete block scheme on a like-for-like basis.<\/p> <p> A number of concerns were expressed to me regarding the proposed new scheme and, as with everything, the devil is in detail.  Many of these matters were discussed by the working group, which was set up in June 2021 and includes affected householders from counties Donegal and Mayo.  This working group did not involve County Clare homeowners.  While I acknowledge that the Clare Pyrite Action Group was given a briefing on the general scheme of the Bill by officials literally days after its publication, and got the opportunity last week to appear before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that is the sum total of the group's involvement in this scheme, which is really disappointing.<\/p> <p> The principal issues that have emerged and which were raised with me by the Clare Pyrite Action Group principally include the damage threshold.  The concern from a County Clare perspective is that the proposed visual inspection of a 1.5 mm crack may leave Clare homes behind.  I say this because access to core testing has enabled County Clare homeowners to make an undisputable case for inclusion in this scheme.  The reality is that houses in County Clare might look visually fine, principally because homeowners have maintained the render on their homes.  If a proper assessment were to take place as part of the assessment process, however, these houses will most certainly be found to be structurally unsound and dangerous.  It is important that regulations that will accompany this Bill recognise this critical point and facilitate homeowners to have the right to appoint their own engineer who will work on their behalf and have access to results.<\/p> <p> In terms of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, I believe that any new reports commissioned for calculation of the rates must include County Clare in order that there is no delay in Clare homeowners entering the scheme and beginning the remediation process as soon as the scheme opens.<\/p> <p> With regard to the appeals process, the time limitations for this must be extended to at least 90 days to afford homeowners the opportunity to prepare any additional materials, as required, to prove their case.  They must also be allowed to submit additional materials rather than prohibiting them from doing so.  This could, for example, be additional independent evaluations of the property or testing.  Remediation options must be appropriate for the damage caused by pyrite attack, which also includes the issue of foundations.  Essentially, householders cannot rebuild their homes without scientific testing and its assurance that their house foundations are sound.  There is also the option with regard to downsizing, which I think needs serious consideration.  We also need to pursue with vigour the quarries responsible for this scandal and hold them to account at every opportunity.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister in his concluding remarks respond to the matters I raised today and, where necessary, will he bring forward the required amendments to this Bill and the accompanying regulations?  I also believe additional time is clearly required for the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and its members to consider fully this legislation and the amendments that will be put forward.  It is important that householders who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with crumbling homes can turn to a fit-for-purpose scheme that enables them to rebuild their homes and lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000032#NN00200","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656594000,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Homeowners in counties Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and up to seven other counties are living in buildings that were built with defective blocks, foundations and other damaging materials like mica and pyrite.  They are feeling the impact of light-touch regulation of building product surveillance that was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the 1990s.  This has left many, like the families in the Gallery, to live in crumbling homes for more than a decade.<\/p>  <p>  For those in County Tipperary, there is still uncertainty about the future and this is something that needs to be addressed.  Indeed, the Minister said last week that further local authority areas can be added as the necessary evidence supports inclusion.  This is no way to treat homeowners who are dealing with such disruption to their lives.  We need to end the uncertainty.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill we have seen falls far short on a number of counts, however, which is another failure on the Minister's watch.  An effective scheme is one that addresses the needs of each household that is affected, and being fully encompassing is key.  I will mention as an example how homeowners who opt to build a smaller home because the grant will not cover the full cost of replacement are being punished with a further reduction in the grant.  The damage threshold, as designed in the Bill, will exclude many homeowners.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  It must be amended to allow for prioritisation of the worst-affected homes and not the exclusion of affected homes.  The exclusion of large numbers of buildings such as holiday homes, community buildings and small business premises is another hole in this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I will go back to the need to scrutinise properly a Bill that will have such profound consequences for households.  The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage was practically railroaded into having to engage in what can only be described as an accelerated scrutiny of this Bill.  As one homeowner said, it has been under a week since the publication of the heads and the draft text of the Bill, so there has been very little time to engage with the proposals and to format this information.  To allow an extremely limited amount of time to scrutinise a Bill of this importance is a masterclass by the Government in shirking accountability.  The affected mica and pyrite homeowners have submitted a significant number of amendments and are urging all Deputies on both sides of this Chamber to support these to fix the defects in the Minister's Bill.  The Minister must accept these proposed changes and ensure no guillotine is imposed.  It is high time to do the right thing by homeowners, listen to their concerns, get this right and help them get through the hell they are dealing with daily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000033#OO00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1656594000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The first thing I wish to do is pay tribute to the many campaigners throughout the country, some of whom are in the Gallery.  When faced with a situation where they discover the house they bought whatever number of years ago is basically crumbling around them, people could be forgiven for collapsing into despair and thinking there is nothing they can do.  We are still not where we need to be but we are at the point we are now because the campaigners did not just take that approach.  Their backs were to the walls and they campaigned extremely valiantly and eloquently like, for example, those who appeared before the joint committee yesterday and those who campaign persistently in massive numbers.<\/p>  <p>  I had the privilege of speaking at a massive protest numbering thousands of people outside the Custom House in Dublin last October.  The determination and resilience of the people there was absolutely clear.  I really want to say fair play to all of them.  They have also helped to raise the plight of other people who are affected by other construction defects, which I will mention later, and have shown that if people campaign, they can actually force change on the Government.  They have had an enormously positive impact in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The message from the campaigners, which is part of the reason the campaign has been so effective, has always been extremely clear: 100% redress and nothing less.  The profoundly strong moral argument behind it, which everybody could understand, is that this is not their fault.  This is not the fault of homeowners.  They had no hand, act or part to blame in terms of this situation.  The responsibility lies with the quarry owners, builders, developers and successive Governments that have built a Republic of developers, quarry owners and so on as opposed to one that serves the interests of ordinary working people.  I will summarise the problem and then go into some more details.  The problem we have at the moment is that the Bill, as presented, is in reality really quite far from 100% redress and nothing less.<\/p> <p>In reality, there is a nice big asterisk beside the redress.  It is a road to 100% redress and then a bunch of small print which has the effect of reducing the amount of redress to significantly less than 100%, meaning that homeowners will continue to be in a crisis situation.<br\/><br\/>I will read a crucial part of the statement issued by the different campaigns from across the counties that came together.  It addresses the Minister:<\/p><blockquote>\tMinister let us be clear, so our words are not misunderstood.  If this bill is not amended, we the homeowners will not support it.  We will continue our campaign and protests until it is amended, until it is fit for purpose. <\/blockquote> <p>It does not get any clearer than that.  The Minister knows these people are not joking or making empty promises.  They are capable of running extremely effective campaigns.  At this point, we are coming to the business end of things here.  This is Second Stage and the deadline for amendments has already passed.  The window for the Government and the Minister to make the right decision is quickly closing and I strongly urge the Minister, primarily for the benefit of the homeowners but also in his own interest, to do the right thing, to make sure the amount of time for Committee Stage is expanded to give the Bill appropriate consideration and to agree to the amendments that will turn this into a 100% redress, nothing less scheme, which is what is required.  We can recall 2017 when the then Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government was discussing the pyrite scheme at the time.  The committee recommended: &quot;The mission statement of the Redress Scheme should be: 'Ordinary owners who purchased in good faith should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others'.&quot;  It is very simple in terms of what should happen.  There is nothing complicated about it.<br\/><br\/>Before I go into things in a little more detail, I will first make a point for anybody who is watching this debate.  When Members on this side of the House call for more time for debate on Committee Stage, there is something people should be aware of regarding what happens in the D&aacute;il.  It is not just that there will not be enough time and therefore not enough exhaustion of the issues and a chance for everybody to contribute, but that we only get as far as the Committee gets with the amendments.  If it has not reached one's amendments, they just fall and are gone if they are not Government's amendments.  The Government's amendments automatically pass.  However, I understand we do not have Government amendments.  If they are Opposition amendments, they automatically disappear in a very undemocratic way.  They are just defeated.  We do not even get to have a vote on them, never mind having the type of exhaustive, comprehensive discussion that is clearly necessary as a result of, first, the situation the homeowners are facing and, second, the amount of money the State is, rightly, talking about spending.  That is one point.<br\/><br\/>The second point in terms of going into the details, we agree with the amendments that have been tabled by Deputy Pringle and others.  I believe there are 80 in total because, as the homeowners brought forward, there are 80 different mistakes and flaws in the Bill.  I will highlight a few.  One is the limitation in section 5 to a small number of counties.  I do not see the logic of doing that.  It does not make sense to do it as we do not yet have a full assessment of where the defective blocks have been used.  Section 8 of the Bill limits the scheme to homes built before 2020.  Again, it does not make sense, particularly in the context of the extremely worrying evidence heard by the committee last week that there may well be defective blocks still being produced as we speak.  Obviously, we have to act to ensure that this is not continuing, but it means putting a time limit for when the homes would have been bought is completely inappropriate.  Similarly, limiting the scheme only to owners who bought their home before 2020 is an unfair and arbitrary line.<br\/><br\/>The issue that has been highlighted and which appears to be a vital question in respect of section 12 is leaving out the cost of replacing foundations when they are affected.  Again, it does not make any sense, neither from the point of view of the homeowners who are affected by mica nor from the point of view of the State.  It will not make any sense for the State to spend billions of euro and to have whatever proportion it is of those euro going into building on defective foundations which will not last and the house will have to come down and it will have to be done all over again.  It would be a crime for us to go through that process.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the point about garages and walls being included, these in reality will constitute a significant reduction in the amount of money that homeowners are able to get.  There is a cap on the total amount of money a homeowner could get.  We have the cap, but we already have had massive amounts of inflation and there will be more by the time the scheme comes into operation, so clearly it is completely inadequate.<br\/><br\/>The point regarding no penalty for downsizing has been extremely well made by the campaigners.  The idea that we should disincentivise people from downsizing their house makes no sense either from a justice point of view or from an environmental point of view.  We should not be putting pressure on people.  If they want to rebuild the same house they currently have, they should be facilitated with 100% redress, but if they want to downsize for whatever reason, the State should fully support them in that.  It means using fewer materials and having a smaller carbon footprint.  That is a good thing and in no way should they be penalised for it.  There are a number of other flaws, and they are being addressed in the Opposition amendments.  They include arbitrary limits in grant timings and flawed methods for calculating the redress.<br\/><br\/>The features in these debates are the fundamental points.  We are in a crisis situation.  We have been through the pyrite issue, now we are dealing with mica and we are going to be dealing with very significant other construction defects and problems, particularly in apartments.  It is all a microcosm of the failings of the Irish political system and its Government.  It is a crumbling monument to all that is wrong and has been wrong with both the Irish construction sector and the political influence of that sector.  It was the predecessors of the Minister and of the Government, which also include both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael down through the years and decades, who presided over a system of self-certification and extremely low levels of regulation and who just allowed shoddy work and inadequate practices to happen all over the place with, at different levels, quarry owners, builders and so forth all operating simply with the aim of maximising their profit and cutting corners at the expense of ordinary householders in the first instance and now, necessarily, the public as a whole in terms of having to pay for a redress scheme.<br\/><br\/>I draw two conclusions from that.  One is that what is necessary now is 100% redress, nothing less, paid for by the State.  Then the State should mercilessly pursue those who are responsible and who created this mess, with a view to maximising the amount of return to the State.  If we can prove that there has been, and the homeowners certainly believe there has been, conscious awareness and knowledge of what was happening on the part of the quarry owners, for example, the quarries should be taken out of private ownership with no compensation and into public ownership, including assets and so forth.  All those assets should be used to right the wrong for which they are responsible.<br\/><br\/>The second conclusion is that we would be in a much better place to deal with this situation if we had a State construction company.  We need to create a State construction company both to address the housing crisis and also to be able to address rapidly the construction defects that have been discovered and will be discovered in the future.  We would be able to deal with it rapidly, as opposed to being reliant on the private market and so forth.<\/p> <p> The final point I will make is that at different phases of this campaign the tactic of divide and rule has been used by the Government or its outriders through asking people in Dublin why they should pay for people in Donegal, Clare or wherever.  Various articles in newspapers and so on have suggested some injustice is being done in that regard.  I say to all the people in the counties affected that the people I represent in Dublin South-West, and the vast majority of people in Dublin and throughout the country, do not share any of those attitudes.  What there is from ordinary people in Dublin and everywhere else is a sentiment of solidarity, fair play and outrage at the injustice that has been perpetrated on people who have experienced the mica issue.  There is also, of course, a sense of why should these people be punished for things that are no fault of theirs but are the responsibility of quarry owners, construction companies and so on?  That divide and rule tactic did not work at all.  There was a major upswell of support and solidarity.  The extremely effective campaigning, including the stickers and posters throughout the entire country raising awareness of this issue, played a very important role in that support.  The divide and rule tactic was completely ineffective.<\/p> <p> This makes me return to the point I referenced at the start, which is that this issue has given people confidence elsewhere.  I will give an example I raised last week with the Minister.  In my constituency, I am now in touch with a significant group of apartment and duplex owners.  These are people in a major apartment complex where significant defects have been discovered.  When I spoke in the Chamber last week, I said to the Minister they were being told they needed to pay &euro;15,000 to deal with fire defects.  Since then, they have received a quantity surveyor's report that states it could cost up to &euro;45,000 for each apartment.  These people are not able to pay that.  They do not have that kind of money.  There is no way that will work.  It simply does not work for them, yet they were presented with the threat that fire officers would shut down access to the building.  However, because of the mica campaigners, they have a sense that this is not on and this is not right.  Just like the people affected by mica, this is not any responsibility of theirs, they could not possibly have known this when they bought their apartments, and they should not be left with the bill.  They and others, and I am aware of another apartment block in Carrickmines, for example, are coming together to say they need redress.<\/p> <p> I support the call that has been mentioned for tax credits in respect of these schemes, but I will make the point that such credits imply people can pay upfront.  Most people do not have &euro;15,000, never mind &euro;45,000, in the bank.  That does not work.  We are now seeing a situation where we are talking about tens of thousands, if not more than 100,000, apartments in particular that were built during the Celtic tiger period, whose owners are victims of self-certification, poor regulation and shoddy building practices, exactly like those issues experienced by homeowners affected by mica.  The idea these people will be able to pay upfront to deal with this is not going to work.  Simply put, we will need a redress scheme, as we had for those affected by pyrite, and we absolutely had to have for those similarly affected by mica, for apartment and duplex owners affected by the shoddy construction that happened during the Celtic tiger, in particular the fire defects.<\/p> <p> I understand the working group was due to report by the end of June, which is today.  I suspect it will be another couple of weeks before it completes its report.  If a tax credit is included in the budget, it is much better than nothing but it will not be enough.  We are now seeing a major problem, partly as a consequence of mica and people becoming aware of it, but also due to fire inspections and so on that are being done.  The same basic principle applies: it is no fault whatsoever of the homeowners.  They were victims of the construction industry, the Government and the State, which poorly regulated that industry, and the State, therefore, needs to step in.  We need to have redress schemes.  We then need to pursue those responsible for the situation we are currently in.<\/p> <p> I am putting the Minister on notice that, unfortunately, this will not be the last redress scheme that will be needed.  I strongly encourage him to take on board the points being made and the position of the mica campaigners.  I ask him to agree to the extension of the debate on Committee Stage to make sure we get to hear all the amendments and, most important, that he accepts the amendments and agrees to a genuine, 100% redress scheme and nothing less because it is what is necessary for the homeowners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000033#OO00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656595200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I welcome the chance to discuss this legislation.  I acknowledge the significant work put in by so many people to get to this point, including the Minister, his team and his officials, but especially homeowners from Mayo, members of Mayo Pyrite Action Group, North Mayo Pyrite Group, Mica Action Group in Donegal, and similar groups from Clare, Limerick and Sligo.  Last week, one of their representatives said they were ordinary homeowners put in an extraordinary situation.  They led an extraordinary response, which should be acknowledged, but those that put them in that situation have to be pursued.<\/p>  <p>  At last week's hearings of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I was struck by the lack of urgency around the appointment of a senior counsel to pursue the avenues into why this happened and into those who caused it.  Far greater urgency needs to be invested in pursuing those matters and that investigation.  When we consider that in the UK &pound;2 billion has been put on the table by the industry in respect of the cladding situation, that is the kind of response we need to see here.  We need to see a contribution, not a levy because that will be passed back, out of profits from some of the most profitable companies in the country to pay towards this and other issues, such as the apartment defects issue.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a lack of response and a lack of engagement from the banks, which are among the ultimate winners in this because they have the mortgages.  The owners are paying banks for their homes.  The banks own those assets and they are very slow in co-operating with and assisting homeowners who are in a situation of having pyrite or mica in blocks.  The banks have made it very difficult for homeowners, as have insurance companies, which are welching on contracts throughout the country because of the suspicion of the presence of pyrite, mica or pyrrhotite.  Insurance companies and banks need to be brought to heel and told they have to serve the people regarding this.  The Government is putting its cards on the table here and, equally, we need to see a far greater engagement with companies such as these.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly refer to a number of areas in the Bill.  I have made a detailed submission to the Minister's office from Ms Martina Hegarty and Ms Josephine Murphy on behalf of the two Mayo mica groups regarding the Bill, which his officials have received and are considering.  On section 5, while I welcome the inclusion of Limerick and Clare, the inclusion process is quite cumbersome.  The people of County Sligo, in particular, who began the process at the same time as County Clare, have been left waiting and wondering why they have been left aside.  There needs to be some sort of assistance provided from the Department to the relevant local authorities because there is a reluctance on the part of those authorities to get involved in this matter.  There is also a complete lack of skills in many local authorities to engage in it.<\/p>  <p>  On section 8 and the whole area of the definition of \"relevant dwellings\", it is important all parts of the house be included.  There is a concern that some extensions may be excluded.  There is also an issue around garages.  There is rather fancy word for garages and things like that in the Bill.  They will equally have defective blocks, which are dangerous to those in the house, and they need to be included in the scheme.  It is a similar situation with boundary walls.  The Minister has given me a commitment they will be included, but boundary walls in public areas of housing estates also need to be included in the scheme.  They offer a serious threat.<\/p>  <p> On sections 10 and 11 and the core area of grants, the Society of Charted Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, process was detailed and published last March.  That would assume the process is working on the basis of construction costs in November and January.  That needs to be updated before the scheme goes live.  Smaller homes will cost more per square metre than larger homes.  We need to look again at the hearings last week and, for example, the case of Ms Martina Hegarty, who is in a smaller house in a terrace where the costs will be greater, even though the house is smaller.  Just because someone has a smaller house, he or she should not be left out of pocket.  The downsizing option is a very real one that needs to be given consideration.<\/p> <p>One frustrating thing is that the computer generally says no when it comes to many ideas.  We need to think outside the box within the local authorities and Departments and give the downsizing option some sort of consideration within the limitations.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is introducing provision in this Bill to fund local authority and AHB homes.  There are houses that are primary residences for vulnerable adults and people with disabilities that are owned by charities which do not have the resources to remediate their houses.  A similar funding option should be made available to those charities, either by the Minister or the Department of Health, in order that those people do not lose their homes in the same way that other homeowners will not lose their homes.<br\/><br\/>There is a major blockage in the scheme.  People are progressing, awaiting the conclusion of this process, but the SEAI process in terms of giving people funding to upgrade heating requirements has come to a complete halt.  I have been in contact with the Minister's office.  We need an urgent update on that because there are people who have had their houses demolished and are awaiting SEAI approval to proceed.  They cannot proceed because the SEAI is saying that it cannot get clearance from its parent Department, which is apparently talking to the Minister's Department.  This is it again - Departments working in silos and not talking to each other.  Meanwhile, the homeowner suffers.<br\/><br\/>With regard to section 12 about remediation options and building conditions assessments, the committee hearings last week were deeply confusing.  There was definite science and very definite people on both sides of this argument.  I know it is being reviewed but there needs to be an urgency to the review of foundations.  I welcome section 51 which triggers a review of the Bill following the review of IS 465.  We need to give certainty with regard to foundations as soon as is possible.  A presentation was made by Mr. Thomas Campbell, a qualified engineer in this space, with regard to a potential solution for the foundation issue.  I forwarded it to the Minister's office.  There are homeowners who want to proceed and get this over with.  If they have to pay for their own foundations, some sort of commitment should be given to funding that if the science stands up.<br\/><br\/>The homeowner's professional, engineer and architect needs to be part of the process too, because that is the only element of trust in all of this.  That needs to be stronger in the Bill.  I have often spoken to the Minister about the damage threshold.  I have serious concerns about it.  We had a nightmare in Mayo last summer around a damage threshold, even though it did not exist.  Being excluded from the scheme was more stressful to homeowners than being told they had pyrite in the first place.  The 1.5 mm with regard to the expert group is not based on any science.  I need to ensure that there will be robust engagement with people on the damage threshold and that it is not used as an exclusionary measure.<br\/><br\/>Why are all the timelines in the Bill on the homeowners?  There is no timeline on the local authority.  There is no timeline on the Housing Agency.  I put the questions to Mr. Bob Jordan last week and, in fairness, he is committed to putting timelines and service level agreements, SLAs, in place.  Timelines are needed on every side of this.  Provision is also needed for <i>force majeure <\/i>cases.  There are cases that will not fit into any of the definitions.  There are older people, in particular, who proceeded ahead of the scheme to remediate their houses for family safety reasons.  They need to be given some sort of recognition.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the huge changes.  It is important to acknowledge them because it is getting lost in the argument today.  This is a very different scheme to what it was this time last year.  However, to make it the kind of scheme that works, we need to engage strongly in the regulations.  Those regulations made it inaccessible on the last occasion and we need to engage strongly around some of the amendments being put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000035#QQ00200","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656595800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>This is not just a Donegal, Sligo, Clare or Mayo issue.  It is a basic issue of fairness.  These families are living in homes that are crumbling.  They deserve our support and anything less than 100% redress is not acceptable.  The State was asleep at the wheel.  It was too busy squandering money in the Celtic tiger era and neglecting its responsibilities to ensure that building materials were fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week.  It is clear from the various contributors that self-regulation of manufacturers, together with inadequate local authority enforcement of standards, allowed unfit concrete blocks to enter the Irish market for years.  Quarry owners, insurance companies and bond providers all washed their hands while the State looked on.  All these homeowners want is their homes back on a like-for-like basis with what they have already paid.  It is not unreasonable to request that and if it is done for pyrite, it can certainly be done for mica.<\/p>  <p>  I struggle to understand the Government's approach.  Why would it exclude foundations, which are made of the same materials as the blocks?  Why exclude boundary walls, sheds and garages which have the same potential to kill a family member when they fall down?  Real costs versus allowable costs at current rates represent more than an 80% grant.  This leaves homeowners out tens of thousands of euro which is a shortfall the Minister knows they simply cannot afford.  There must be true like-for-like replacement, including house finishes, end-to-end contract management by the State and a zero cost to the homeowner.<\/p>  <p>  Instead, homeowners are offered a grant to carry out repairs, leaving them to find contractors who will work to the inadequate grants provided and at the mercy of inflation, while being choked up by red tape.  The Government must provide a penalty-free downsizing option that would allow the grant based on their current home size to be redirected to building themselves a smaller one if they so wish.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the work of the Mica Action Group which has been tireless in its campaign to achieve a just solution for homeowners.  It has identified 35 issues in the general scheme, about which the Minister has been told, all of which render the scheme unworkable to a greater or lesser extent.  This legislation is an opportunity for the Minister to do the right thing by these families and not be tone deaf.  The families and their concerns have to be listened to.  It is very simple.  It has to be 100% redress and nothing less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000036#RR00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1656595800,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in.  I acknowledge that he has done a lot of hard work.  Instead of everything being negative, it should be very positive going forward.  These are family homes.  Families want to get this situation sorted out and I believe the Minister will get this sorted out.  Let us stop playing a political game of football.  The most important thing is getting the houses built, getting the families back in and starting to move on.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that all people who are adversely affected by the defective material in their properties get redress.  Everybody has to get redress.  We do not know the full impact and the lack of the regulation of construction material in Ireland is not helping the situation.  I believe all counties in Ireland are having problems and all should, automatically, be allowed the allocation of funding.  I spoke to the Minister a few months ago with the county manager, Ms Joan Martin, in Dundalk.  We believe there are at least ten to 15 people in the county who have this problem.  The Minister told us that we had to put in a submission.  I spoke to the county manager again today and I know that submission has not gone in yet.  However, as I said to the Minister, it is about the families and the people.  It is very important.  Nobody is saying that only ten or 12 counties are affected.  We all know that every county has a problem.  Every county should be given an opportunity to get their family home back up and running.<\/p>  <p>  I talk to people on the ground, like most Deputies here.  People are very sceptical and worried because a house is a house.  That includes the garage and patio.  People are being told to leave the foundations or the patio.  One cannot do that because, naturally, much of the material in these buildings is also part of the house.  It is very important that these are all part of the compensation.  I spoke to many people over the past number of years who have invested in private houses and have gotten involved in the rental market.  As far as I am concerned, they have the same right as other people.  If one looks at these houses, they are playing a big part in the market.  Most of these houses are leased out to people or the council.  It is very important that these people are looked after as well.<\/p>  <p>  I used the words \"nervous\" and \"worried\".  People are nervous and very worried.  I ask the Minister to try to make it simple.  In fairness, he does not complicate things.  He just tries to say them as they are and that will be very important going forward.  The biggest problem I hear in my constituency office is that when it comes to application forms, people are afraid of filling them in.  They are afraid to look for grants because they do not understand the system.<\/p> <p>It is important that when people fill in the application form for the grant and put in whatever information they need, they be given a bit of scope in that.  The last thing we want is for people to be refused because they did not fill the application form in correctly.  It is important that the proper staff are working on this.  They should talk to people and let them know what the situation is.  People are panicking about getting the application in as quickly as possible and the timeframes.  It was mentioned earlier that it all seems to be on the householder.  It is important that the local authorities work closely with the person involved in the house.<\/p> <p> Another big problem is that a lot of people are going together to look for engineering reports.  It is very hard to get someone to put it down with paper and pen and people come looking for everything else.  It is important that it is all done right.  When people go into local authorities, the staff do not seem to know how much money they have to pay and they want to know how quickly they will get a response back on their applications.  It is the same in politics - communication.  Once people are communicated with and once they know what is happening, I do not see a serious problem.  Many families are worried that someone might just knock on the door, come in and inspect the house.  That is the last thing we want to do.  I am not trying to be smart but these people are looking at their houses and seeing cracks in the walls and holes in the ceiling.  People are house-proud and the last thing they want is someone coming to the house and knocking on the door with the family in the house and everything else.  Kids are inquisitive and the last thing you want is for them to realise what is going on.  I guarantee the Minister that a lot of people have not told their children exactly what is happening.  They might tell them there is a new house coming.  It is important that we try to get this done as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> On the issue of foundations, the foundation of a house is like someone's life or body to them.  The foundations have to go, end of story.  You cannot just go in and build a house on top of deleterious material; it makes no sense whatsoever.  It is very important that the foundations go.<\/p> <p> We are talking about money, and it is important that we have the money in place so that when people start, they can get finished.  The Minister is saying it is capped at &euro;420,000 or &euro;430,000 and it is important that money is available so that when people start doing the work, there will be a completion date coming up.  There is no point in starting in January and finishing in January two years later.  It is important that the money is there to finish the job.  I know contractors will not be too happy to do the work unless they know the money is there.<\/p> <p> We are having serious issues around the country with labour.  I was trying to get an extension done on my house recently and I was told it would take four or five months for a simple job.  Worst of all, when you go into a hardware shop to look for building material, it is nearly impossible to get it.  They do not want to carry the stock because it is too expensive to carry it.  There is an uncertainty about materials, labour and everything else and that is important going forward.<\/p> <p> I mentioned Louth earlier but I ask the Minster to let the Twenty-six Counties in.  The Louth county manager is active.  It might not seem like a lot to include ten or 15 people but when you have your own home you should be treated the exact same as everybody else, and that is important going forward.  I was in my home town of Dundalk during the week and I met a fellow who had to leave his home back in 2018.  He had been living in that home with his wife since 1991 and they had a lot of great memories there.  All of a sudden he saw cracks appearing from nowhere.  He did not know what it was and all of a sudden the ceiling, walls and everything else were affected.  In 2018, he had to physically take his wife and children out of the house.  There was a problem and it was too dangerous to stay in the house but that poor wife spent 12 weeks in a centre suffering from depression.  She had to leave the home that she spent the guts of 20 years building it up.  People want to stay in their own homes, especially among the older generation.  It is important going forward that we have a wee bit of sympathy for these people.  These are their homes<\/p> <p> I have dealt with the Minister on a number of different issues in recent weeks and he is approachable and he listens to people.  I ask people to have a bit of trust in the Minister.  This should not be made into a political football; it is serious.  I heard another Deputy mention today that this would not be the first redress scheme and that more and more would be coming down the road.  That is not fair.  I know the Minister fought very hard to get the money together.  The sooner we start, the better.  I ask him to get it right and communicate with the people.  These are family homes and if people want to downsize or upsize, they should have that option.  It is important that people get their old homes into their new homes and try to get memories back as soon as possible.  People just need to get their lives back together again.  As an Independent Deputy, I trust him and when he says things, he does so passionately.  I might get a bit of flak for supporting him but the reason I want to support him is that I know these people want to get their homes back and get their lives. up and running.  We have to show trust in the Minister and if he leads from the front, the people will get behind him.  I look forward to working with him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000036#RR00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656596400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>This debate, which will no doubt be well-watched by the families and individuals at the centre of the legislation, is critical.  I hope the Bill brings an end to their wait for much-needed support.  Last week our Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage held a special eight-hour session where we heard from industry experts, including the SCSI; the Institution of Engineers Ireland; departmental officials; the Housing Agency; and the chair of the expert working group.  Most importantly, we heard from the representatives of the families affected by defective blocks, many of whom are with us today.  We heard from the Mica Action Group in Donegal, the Clare Pyrite Action Group and the Mayo Pyrite Action Group.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand in homes in my constituency walls bloating and cracks that often appeared overnight but that become gaping constant reminders of how insecure someone's home is.  Imagine living in a home you do not feel safe in, a home where you know the creaks and the cracks are not just a house settling but a house starting to crumble.  Imagine going to bed every night knowing that the structure of your home is unstable.  That is the reality for many families whose homes were built by blocks that have turned out to be defective.  Imagine the anger you would feel knowing the quarries are not being held to account and from having to campaign for years to access funding to remedy things.  Families impacted by mica and pyrite have waited long enough.  They need this legislation passed and this funding provided and they need it yesterday.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill contains many welcome changes to the original scheme.  It is important to acknowledge that these changes were made in response to feedback from affected homeowners and that the changes were recommended by the expert working group, chaired by Paul Forde.  Those changes include the likes of retrospective inclusion; an appeals process; a legal footing for the certificate of remediation; and the Housing Agency taking on the cost of the testing.  This Bill has at its core an ambition to provide a fair and equitable solution to all homeowners affected by defective blocks and that includes homeowners in Clare and Limerick now too.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister has a wider ambition to make sure that this never happens again.  That is why it was so concerning to hear from a chartered engineer in the joint committee that a quarry in the south-east is still operating at fault.  This cannot be let continue.  Our committee has written to the building condition assessment office to escalate this accusation because if that is still going on then there is no excusing it.  I know the Minister is doing a lot of work on the regulation of providers of building works Bill and that work is crucial because if there is one thing we have learned from the nightmares that these families have been living through, it is that we cannot allow this to ever happen again.  The same is true of construction companies that have left thousands of apartment owners in similar positions, including some of my constituents in apartments in Lucan, many of whom were already in debt due to remediation costs.<\/p> <p>They need to be treated fairly too.<\/p> <p> In terms of the fair and equitable package for homeowners we are discussing, we need to face up to the reality of inflation.  The funding model for this scheme was based on a comprehensive body of work carried out by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland and I thank that society's volunteers who gave so much time and expertise to help these families.  However, there is no denying that Ireland is in a different space from where we were in February.  Inflation is a reality and those costs cannot be let spiral.  Given how much construction costs have increased since the funding model was drawn up, it is critical we ensure payments are adequate, fair and equitable, even now, because these families need to access the right amount of money to build safe homes, the homes they deserve and should have got in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000037#SS00200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656597000,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Higgins for allowing me to take some of her time.  I appreciate it.  I welcome this overdue legislation.  It has been a difficult time for a huge amount of families.  Unfortunately, pyrite and mica do not stop in Donegal, Clare or Mayo.  On Monday last, I visited a house in my constituency of Wexford where it was visible to me that there is either mica or pyrite.  I understand this scheme will be expanded beyond the counties I mentioned through local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Families in Donegal, Clare and Mayo have gone through a horrid time in recent years.  I praise my colleague, former Minister and Teachta D&aacute;la for Donegal, Deputy McHugh, who has done a huge amount of work in the area in recent years.  In conversations with him, I found out exactly the extent of the problem in Donegal.  When I visited the house in my constituency on Monday, it brought back some of the conversations I had with Deputy McHugh.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies have raised a number of issues but we are talking about families, real people who have pride in their homes.  Their homes are their castles.  Those of us lucky enough to have our own home appreciate how much we love it, how much investment we put into it and the memories we have in it.  The lives of these families have been turned upside-down in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister of State and the Department to make this process as simple as possible for the families.  There has to be accountability, as we all appreciate, but on occasions Departments design schemes that make application so cumbersome for families and homeowners that they do not apply.  I ask that this be a simple process.  Outside of counties Donegal, Clare and Mayo, where there is a huge issue, I ask that in County Wexford the people affected by mica or pyrite can go to the local authority to be seen and their story listened to, so they can be part and parcel of this scheme.  They are afraid they are falling outside the scheme.  Wexford has been mentioned as one of the potentially affected counties.  I know of three cases in County Wexford where there is mica or pyrite.  I plead with the Minister of State and Department that in County Wexford no homeowner will be left outside this scheme but will be part of it and treated in the same way as people in Donegal, Mayo and Clare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000038#TT00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speech","time":1656597000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Where do we start?  Regulation, building product surveillance: it is fair to say they were not up to scratch, far from it.  We have failed a number of people miserably.  We are talking at the minute about Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Sligo, Limerick, Tipperary and up to seven more counties.  I have heard a number of Teachta&iacute; talk about my constituency of Louth.  This is a small island and it is difficult to see how it will not be every county, on the basis that there are no customs posts, as a Deputy said earlier.  These building materials will have made their way into every county, village and town.  What does that mean?  It means we have left people with crumbling homes, through no fault of their own.  People need to think about that.  That is your home and it is suddenly falling apart.  We have all seen the pictures and videos.  Many here, including I think the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, have visited some of the homes and seen the devastation.  It is not going to get any better.  That is why we are discussing this.  The main reason is the pressure put on by the campaigners, some of whom are here today.  I commend the work they have done and the pressure they have put on.  What they need and want is a process that works and one they deserve.  It is a system.  They want a government that has their back.<\/p>  <p>  We all want justice.  We need to go after the quarries and block manufacturers but, first and foremost, we need to make sure we look after these people, particularly the campaigners.  I have no doubt that many of them, as committed as they are, are tired and just want to see an end to this process.  We need to facilitate them as much as possible.  They just want to get on with their lives.  We know the issues, including 100% redress and difficulties with the caps.  There will be problems with the rate of inflation and there are issues if people want to downsize.<\/p>  <p>  We need to make up for these gaps in this legislation.  There is talk of the difficulty around foundations.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and many others across the House have agreed they would be willing to deal with the huge amount of amendments put in to fill these gaps and offer people a process that will deliver them the homes they need, whether that is like-for-like or otherwise.  We need to facilitate that so I expect the Government will be forthcoming and allow this.  People have stated they have no problem putting the hours in next week to make sure.

I am sorry for what they have had to go through.  I will simplify it for the Minister of State: I will talk about the foundations in this Bill.  If the Minister of State had a tree in his garden and there was a problem with the leaves, would he treat the leaves or the root of the problem?  In the same way, the Minister of State will stand up and walk out of here in a few minutes and, unless he has a good pair of shoes on, he will fall over.  The foundation he puts himself on is his pair of shoes.  The Government's approach to the foundations does not make any sense.  Under no circumstances should the foundations not be included in the Bill.  To test foundations, engineers will have to dig around the outside of the foundations and test to make sure they are the same density all around.  Then they will have to core-test them and do different tests on them.  The expense of doing all that would go a long way towards replacing the foundations.  If you have to do that on top of the engineer's fees, it makes it more expensive.  The real answer is to remove all foundations and put the new structure on top of new foundations.<\/p>  <p>  In the housing committee last week we had the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the SEAI.<\/p> <p>They told us it takes three months or so to come up with figures in respect of the building of houses.  I am in the real world and I am a building contractor myself.  If it took me three months to come up with a price for a house, I would not be in business.  The first SEAI report I got related to the retrofit grant.  It came up with costings in October.  The next costings came up in February.  Anyone who knows quantity surveying will know that the quantities will not have changed.  All that needs to be done is for the figures to be updated with today's costs.  The computer system does it all by itself.  In my business, I may have to do that every week.  I use the same model the Government is using but it is saying that it takes three months to update the figures.<\/p> <p> I will give the Minister of State yesterday's figures.  The maximum the Government proposes to give to people is &euro;420,000.  Is it now going to tell the people of Ireland that it is not &euro;420,000 because it includes VAT at 13.5%?  It is actually giving people &euro;370,044.05.  You then subtract &euro;20,000 for storage and rent, if the recipients are lucky enough to be able to rent a house because we have a housing crisis.  That brings the figure down to &euro;350,044.05.  With today's costs, that equates to a house of 1,944 sq. ft.  However, you then have to consider today's building costs.  If it can be believed, today's building costs, including the 25% increase in the cost of insulation from Kingspan to come in on 1 July, which we can plan for, means that this &euro;350,000 will only build a house of 1,750 sq. ft.  <\/p> <p> We have forgotten one thing, however.  We have forgotten that we will have to replace the bathrooms, floors and kitchens throughout the house.  That is also included in the Government figures.  Not only that but, when you take down the house and do all of the retrofit, you have then destroyed the sewerage system, the pipework around the house, the footpaths, the driveways, the lawns and everything else that you have taken out.  If you take out a sum for remediation costs and the basic cost of replacing the bathrooms, kitchens and flooring throughout the house, it brings the &euro;420,000 the Government has given as the maximum figure down to &euro;300,000.  This brings me to my point.  At today's prices, the maximum sum the Government is allowing for only allows for a house of 1,500 sq. ft.  That is what is wrong.  I will return to the three months it took to update figures.  It takes my business a maximum of a week because we already have the template.  I do not accept the Government's figures.<\/p> <p> Let us now move to a house in Mayo.  We will use a smaller house for an example in Mayo and we will use the figures that were used earlier on.  A house of 90 sq. m, which equals 969 sq. ft, would cost &euro;197,966.70 to build.  If you add &euro;20,000 for storage and rent and a sum for the cost of finishing the house, that 90 sq. m house will cost &euro;237,966.70 to build.  I was able to come up with that using a calculator in the space of half an hour today but it takes the Government three months.<\/p> <p> We will now go into the issue of coring, which the Government is so against.  The Government representatives have stood up here to tell us about retrofit grants throughout the country.  If you put insulation into the cavity of a house that has pyrite but which has not shown any signs yet, you accelerate the process.  It sweats the cavity and creates a reaction, accelerating the process.  Within four or five years, the walls will be in trouble.  Houses are falling down all around us at the moment but, in this Bill, the Government is refusing to allow coring to be the main method by which people find out whether their houses contain pyrite.  It would help in the future and save the Government money if houses were core-tested first but it does not want to do that.  Why?  It is because it would provide a full census of every affected house in Ireland, including those in counties which have not yet been introduced to the scheme.  Several more counties are coming in and we will have more.  Core testing would give a full picture but the Government does not want to see that full picture.  It is common sense.  The Government wants to allow houses to be retrofitted now but it will all have to be pulled down and the houses rebuilt.  That is not common sense.  It is a waste of money.<\/p> <p> We must consider one more fact.  Most of the houses built in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s had slate roofs.  I am in building and, in any house I retrofit and renovate, the slates have to be tested, which comes at a cost.  In every house I have done so far, traces of asbestos have been found in the slates.  We then need a specialised unit to come out to remove the slates, bag them up and ship them to Germany and other countries, where they are dealt with.  That costs approximately &euro;10,000.  The Government has not factored that into its costings.  How do I know this?  I am building every day.  Other Independent Members, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats and I have brought this issue to the Government through the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage but it is not listening.  Why is it so afraid that we are able to get things right while the Government, with all its expensive Departments, cannot?<\/p> <p> This is about real live people.  I ask the Minister of State to take a look into the Gallery above us.  I want him to look at the children, their parents, their brothers and sisters and their uncles and aunts.  They will remember the Government not listening to people who understand.  No matter what the Minister of State's expensive Department does, it cannot replace the expertise of those who are in the sector doing the work every day and bringing the facts to its door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000038#TT00400","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656597600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.

Perhaps he is reflecting on his bad behaviour last week.  I do not know but it is disappointing to see that he is not here.<\/p>  <p>  I have met many people from Donegal and Mayo outside the gates of Leinster House and have seen the looks of despair and anguish on their faces.  That is why I am here today.  I am a Deputy from the midlands but I believe that this is an important issue that needs to be resolved urgently because it is desperately unfair on those families.  These families have been through turmoil.  They need to see action.  Government needs to instil confidence that it is doing its best.  To date, that confidence certainly has not been instilled.  Why would the Government leave foundations out of the proposed redress scheme?  That is incredible but not surprising.

Below our feet our homes are crumbling and unable to support the walls - what is it going to take to make the government realise that a tragedy will happen?  Sadly I have no doubt this will be a reality as families will be unable to avail of the scheme as it stands due to the shortfall between the grant and actual building costs.  Our homes are destined to crumble down around us until it takes us, I just hope and pray that children are not harmed, maimed for life or worse ... this is the stage we are getting to and many homes should be condemned.<br \/><br \/>As our walls are weakening our ... floors are too heavy to be supported by the walls that are crumbling down around them ... where is the safest place in your opinion for me to sleep at night? ... I am sure you will agree it is a tough decision to take when going to bed at night.  Sleeping on the first floor - would I be safer as I will fall to the floor below when this eventually happens?  or maybe I would be safer on the ground floor of my home and take my chances that the ... slab will perhaps miss me as it falls down?  I am sure you will agree this is tough call as you put your children to bed [every] night haunted by the fact of what can happen in the night and [wondering] if they will be safe.<br \/><br \/>[...]<br \/><br \/>We have done absolutely nothing wrong yet are living this nightmare daily.  We are stressed and extremely anxious to hear if we can rebuild our homes and if the science and research from world leaders in this field will be listened to.  How can this research and advice from these experts be ignored?<br \/><br \/>Sadly the SCSI rates will not allow me to rebuild my home as the rates leave a massive shortfall (approx &euro;60,000 + foundations) but please, please put yourself in our shoes - how would you feel if you had built a home and the government did not regulate the block manufacturers and now we the innocent victims of this ... crisis are left to spend the rest of our days in fear of our safety or be in debt the rest of our lives.  How can this possibly be fair?  If you can find a builder to build at these rates please pass on my details as I have yet to find a builder who comes anywhere close [to] the SCSI rates.  <\/blockquote> <p>The issues around cost have been pointed out by Deputy O'Donoghue, who is an expert in this field as he is a building contractor.  Insulation from companies like Kingspan will increase by 25% by 1 July.  These costs were not factored into the current proposal.  Costs are escalating every day.

They came to the front of the D&aacute;il in the most dignified and profoundly professional manner.  Their homes are falling down around them.  There is talk of following the science.  We heard a lot about science during Covid and much of that science was wrong too.  Why will the Government not follow the science here?  It is trying to bring us nose first into this and dip our noses into the science.  This is an abject failure by the Minister and Department officials.  They refuse to listen to anyone else who knows better.  These people are dictating.  They are unchallenged and are getting away with it.  Anybody who has ever stood on a building site, and I must declare I am a plant contractor myself, knows the foundation is the most important part of any building, organisation or anything else.  Leaving the foundations out of the scheme is pure mockery.  There are a couple of layers of blocks that raise up the subfloors and walls and they are filled up with screed and concrete.  How could the Government leave out the foundations?  They will crack and crumble and crack every bit of the house.  That would happen even if there was no mica or pyrite, if there were bad foundations.  That has happened in many places where there poor foundations without enough steel or on bad ground.  Why will the officials in the Department not take off their shoes and go out and see the houses?<\/p>  <p>  This issue has been around for so long and the way this Bill is being rushed through in the final days before the summer recess is despicable.  The Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has offered to deal with the amendments but the Government will not allow it to.  I salute Deputy O'Donoghue, who is on that committee and is willing to give his time, along with Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others, to deal with it.  It is being rushed through on shaky foundations.  The Government has been warned time and again that it is on shaky ground.  It has no empathy, sorrow, sympathy or respect for the ordinary people.  Thank God we do not get them here, but we see houses being wrecked by earthquakes and things like that, or even in the war that is going on now.  That is happening incrementally by the minute, hourly and daily in people's homes.  These people were brave enough to put their hands in their pockets.  They got up early in the mornings to go out to work to get a mortgage and build their own houses.  Many of them built them themselves and many got contractors.<\/p>  <p>  All the while the Government is turning its eyes away from the real problem, which is the big conglomerates that supplied the concrete.  To think this scheme might go ahead - it probably will go ahead - and the concrete, aggregate and blocks could come from the same sandpits or rock pits they came from already beggars belief.  That shows one thing.  It is nothing personal to the Minister or the Minister of State.  It shows this Government, and successive Governments, is and have been beholden to big business.  I have attended CRH's AGMs in fancy hotels here in Dublin to fight for people who were grievously wronged by that company in the past.  This has gone on all over the world, with challenges, court cases and settlements.  The Government is happy to use these quarries and those belonging to some more friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  They are untouchable.  They shall not be named.  You cannot go near them because they are the Government's friends.  Those days are gone.  The people of Donegal, Mayo, Limerick and many other counties must be looked after.<\/p>  <p>  We have tabled a number of amendments, which I am sure we will not get time to move or discuss.  We want to extend the scheme to Tipperary as well.  The Bunratty quarry is only over the border from us in Tipperary.  I collected roof tiles from there myself when I was putting an extension on my house.  What is the Government at?  The mockery is over.  The shenanigans are over and should be over.  The Government needs to get real, get down and dirty and get the proper foundations.  If you only put a stone upon a stone there will be so much done but if you build a castle on bad foundations, you might as well have a sandcastle because when the first bit of rain comes, it will melt.  I have met families outside the gate here, taobh amuigh den gheata, who are afraid of yellow and orange weather warnings in case the house collapses around them.  Imagine living in that fear.  The walls are crumbling.  They showed me the aggregate in plastic bags.  That morning it was in solid knobs but it had burst by the came they came here.  A crusher would not crush it that well, yet the quarries are exempted.  The big businesses are gone again.  It goes back to PMPA and the insurance bailout, the meat conglomerates and the Goodman empire - bailed out again.  We are not allowed speak about it.  We have to close or eyes and not even look at the quarries.  We have to keep away from them in case we might have to pay back any of the bankrolling they did for the political parties.

My first involvement in pyrite was in getting Limerick included in the pyrite remediation scheme, which involves pyrite in the hardcore of the foundations.  Limerick City and County Council had to apply to the pyrite remediation board and we succeeded in getting it included.  I saw the devastation that caused for people in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, in June of least year it came to my notice that pyrite was in the blockwork of houses in Limerick.  I asked Limerick City and County Council to apply for this current mica scheme, as it is known.  In layman's terms, it is about pyrite and mica in the blockwork.  That is a misunderstanding for people.  Limerick City and County Council agreed to do that.  I wrote to the city manager at the time, and he agreed to write to the Department to get Limerick included.  I welcome that it has been included.  I have seen the homes.  In many cases, the gable ends are effectively falling away from the house itself.  It is devastating for these people.<\/p> <p>It has happened through no fault of their own.  Limerick City and County Council did great work in a short period to come up with the criteria to get Limerick included as part of this defective blocks scheme.  I have a couple of comments to make.  The criteria to qualify were really about showing the issue was from the blockwork upwards.  The blocks could be below or above ground.  However, it was not a requirement to look at pyrite in the foundations.  That has to be looked at.  I do not have experience in building; I am a layman.  If we rebuild houses based on a scheme that stated people just had to prove that there was pyrite in the defective blocks, both overground and underground, it does not to make sense to build on foundations that were not tested and may have pyrite.  We need to include the foundations in the scheme.<\/p> <p> We have to look at the downsizing aspect.  If people are willing to reduce the size of their homes, that is not unreasonable and they should be allowed to do that.  The threshold needs to be looked at.  We are in a phase of rising prices.  I would like those matters to be considered.<\/p> <p> There is a human dimension here.  There are both young families and older people with mortgages.  Through no fault of their own, their houses are effectively crumbling.  They are unsafe and need to be looked at.<\/p> <p> We have two schemes at Limerick at the moment.  The current scheme is for pyrite and defective blocks.  We also have a pyrite remediation scheme, which is administered by the pyrite remediation board and provides for 100% remediation for the hardcore.  It is allowed for blocks underground and overground and for hardcore, but it is not allowed for foundations.  For the scheme to be a true success, we must do due diligence and ensure we are not building houses on foundations with pyrite.<\/p> <p> Limerick is a bit behind compared with Donegal.  We do not fully know the number of houses that have been impacted, which worries me.  We know which quarries the materials came from.  The initial working group was established in Limerick in 2021.  Anything further would include the Limerick Pyrite Action Group.  Anne Ryan has done terrific work in the area.  Individual families come to me about it.  I am always reluctant to name people and, therefore, I will not but there are tremendous engineers and staff of the council who did phenomenal work in a short time.  Consequently, they were successful in getting the area to qualify.<\/p> <p> The appeal period is not sufficiently lengthy.  It should be increased to 90 days.  When the Minister is examining calculations of cost, Limerick should be factored in, because the calculated rates did not include it.<\/p> <p> I welcome the scheme, which has many good aspects.  If we are to have a robust scheme, we must look at the facts presented.  We must look at foundations.  We have the added benefit in Limerick of having the pyrite remediation scheme for the hardcore, which is an element of the foundations, for the layman.  We have the mica scheme and defective blocks scheme for pyrite in the blocks both overground and underground.  We need to make sure that when they build on top of the foundations, they are addressed.  The most important matter is the human dimension and helping families, as I found in Limerick.

Their campaign for justice and their bravery in the face of an unsympathetic Government is to be commended.

Families have done their homework and they do not appreciate being told it provides 100% redress when they know exactly what it will cost them and that the Government scheme will fall short.  It is unfair and disingenuous of Government to constantly seek to contradict people who are living this day and night.  They are well aware of the figures and have done their homework.

These have to be updated before any scheme opens.  Further, the terms of reference for the costings are also too restrictive, excluding foundations, garages and boundary walls.  These must be included as they are part of the home.  Finally, the industry standard underpinning the scheme, IS 465, does not including other deleterious materials such as pyrrhotite, which has to change.  On this last point, regarding pyrrhotite, there are countless people across north County Dublin who can relate directly to the story of the families who are impacted by the mica scandal.  They sat and watched their own homes crumble before their eyes due to pyrite.  They had to campaign to secure a remediation scheme and to have that scheme be made fit for purpose.  Many still cannot sell their homes and move on with their lives.  They are stuck where they are.  The impact of this crisis on these families has been deep and will be long-lasting.<\/p>  <p>  Only yesterday, I heard from some families.  I hoped the Minister would be present to hear this and to join with me to collectively make an effort.  These families are living in north County Dublin where the pyrite issues were worst.  They depend on a transport system to get them into town.  The Fingal express has been withdrawn from them, which is another blow.  They are stuck where they are.  The bus service is vital.  I want it to restored and the Minister for Transport to do his work with other Deputies in my area.  When the people in my constituency look on the television and see the crumbling homes, they feel that sense of solidarity because they have had to live through it themselves.  Many of them now find themselves in a situation where they cannot sell their homes or move on with their lives.  Their families have grown and they are stuck.  The impact of not getting this right will be far-reaching and will last for decades<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000041#WW00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1656598800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I reiterate my complete support for the statement from homeowners&rsquo; representatives read into the record today by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  It is a sad indictment of us in this political system and of the Government that it has come to this.  Ordinary people who have invested so much in this process and in making the scheme work have had to put that statement on the record to show how the Government has ignored them.  That is sad.  That echoes in my mind as I speak here.  I think what we are doing today is a waste of time.  The deadline for amendments has passed.  The Minister of State is not listening to us.  He is sitting there uncomfortably.  I am sure there are many other things he would rather do.  This makes no difference because he will not take our issues on board or do anything. I am disgusted by what the Minister fervently presented to us today as the panacea to the problems faced by my constituents in Donegal and other affected counties to the problem of defective blocks in their homes.<\/p> <p>It clearly is not.  In his opening contribution, the Minister said:  \"We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good and we need to get a practical scheme moving.\"  It would make you sick.  The reality of the situation is with this scheme the Minister is letting inadequate be the enemy of the good.<\/p> <p> I am disgusted at the way the Bill confirms that, despite what the Taoiseach has presented in the House, as \"extensive consultations with homeowners\", their concerns have not been addressed and not been listened to.  The Minister and his officials sat in meetings with people for the past six months, pretended to listen to them, and then ignored them.  It is obvious that all of us have been completely ignored.  There is no point in claiming that just hearing them is good enough, because in ignoring them, the Minister and Government are making a judgment on what they think of the people&rsquo;s concerns.  They are dismissing them, and today&rsquo;s Bill does that over and over again.  The words of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine earlier saying he recognises homeowners' work on this, ring increasingly hollow.  It is really sad and it is sickening.<\/p> <p> I call on Government-backing Deputies from the affected counties to finally be honest and straight with the people and admit they do not care that the party will come before the people, as they always intended.  This is what is really happening here.  There is also disgust at the process that has been followed to avoid proper legislative scrutiny and to minimise the opportunity for media scrutiny.  That is the only reasonable conclusion I can come to for all this rush after months of delay from the Government.  Let me be clear, however, that there is no surprise here.  From the very start, I have said it honestly to the homeowners in Donegal that I did not believe the Government politicians were being genuine with them when they stood on platforms and promised they would resign if the Bill did not provide 100% redress.  I told them that I did not believe the Minister or the Department had any intention of providing 100% redress, and, sadly, this has been shown today.  I had hoped that I would be wrong and that the process would show that we can be wrong but it does not happen in this political system.<\/p> <p> It is not just about the content of the Bill presented here; it is also about the fact that the Government is hell bent on ramming it through Committee and Remaining Stages in two hours next week.  It means this debate is a total farce.  It has no point in terms of the legislative principles of this House, as the deadline for the submission of amendments had passed prior to the start of the debate.  What will the Minister take away from the debate?  Absolutely nothing.<\/p> <p> I and others have worked tirelessly over the past week to draft amendments, with well in excess of 150 in total submitted for this morning's deadline.  They were drafted to address the concerns of the homeowners and deal with obvious flaws in the Bill as presented.  It was then confirmed to me earlier today by the Bills Office that no Government amendments were submitted at all.  We now know the Minister had already decided to change nothing to address the concerns of people and residents.  Such contempt for the parliamentary process is hard to take for those of us who sit in this Chamber but it is insignificant when compared to the clear message the Minister and the Minister of State are sending to those watching in the Public Gallery, my constituents in Donegal and people in other counties who are watching this in the hope that there can be a better outcome for them.  As I said earlier, Deputies are used to this and we expect it, but sadly it has now been shown for the people outside the House what it actually means.  At the moment they are left with the false hope of the Opposition amendments to cling to.  Again, I was very clear to those I spoke to that many of our amendments will be ruled out of order as being a cost on the State.  Amendments of the kind needed to fix this Bill can only be brought forward by a Member of the Government.  They are not going to do it, and the Minister of State knows this.  Once again, I believe he should drop the charade and be honest with people.  The likes of promises of a review by a senior counsel into the defective blocks saga will butter few parsnips with people in Donegal.  We are still waiting on the Mulcahy report to be published by the Government.  It was commissioned in 2015 and has been on the ministerial desk for the past five years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, knows where I think he should stick his senior counsel review.  It will be just more of the same thing and will not mean anything at all.<\/p> <p> I will be brief regarding the Bill because I know I am wasting my breath.  It is rule by regulation and it is not good enough.  Could the Minister of State not see the return of the sliding scale through regulation?  What is to stop the Minister of State?  Is it his solemn promise?  I propose to mandate the inclusion of homeowners' representatives, their engineers and experts in geology and materials science, in the formulation of all regulations.  They should follow the science, not the whim of officials with an eye on the purse, and not aggregate the remediation and ancillary grants.  It is just unfair.<\/p> <p> The Bill does not deal with multiple occupancy dwellings.  Does the Minister of State not realise that these buildings are crumbling also and that families live in them too?  If a homeowner gets remediation for only one house that he or she owns, then tenants in their other homes will be forced to live in buildings that will crumble in the future.  I would seek to drop the limit of one rental property and revise the cut-off date for registration of tenancies.  An opportunity for tenancies to be legitimised with the RTB must be given.  This is not about landlords getting multiple grants; this is about the families who live in these properties and pay rent.  It is their principal private residence, whether they own it or not.<\/p> <p> I would also seek to extend the scheme State-wide now.  In reality, this is where it will end up.  There is no way the defective blocks saga is confined to counties Donegal, Mayo, Clare and Leitrim.  We are aware that Sligo is affected, as are numerous other counties.  The scheme must be nationwide.  Why is it not nationwide?  It must be some attempt by the Minister's officials to make it look as though they control costs by restricting the counties it will operate in.  A person living in an affected building that is over the county boundary will have to wait years and campaign to be included while their house is collapsing around them.  The scheme must include all buildings such as schools, nursing homes, hotels, shops, factory buildings and farm sheds, otherwise economic life and people&rsquo;s jobs will never get back to normal.<\/p> <p> The Bill should mandate the testing for all known iron sulphides, mandate the testing of foundations, and mandate the revision of IS 465 as the earliest cut-off date for inclusion, not January 2020.  The Minister should also set realistic cut-off dates.  Not many people in Inishowen are going to be able to get a builder within a year and a half when many householders are looking for builders at the same time to be included in the scheme.<\/p> <p> The grant cut for downsizing must also be dropped.  It is mean-minded and mean-spirited, as was said earlier.  The base rate should be index linked from the date of the Government's big announcement back in November if the Government is genuine about this scheme meeting the homeowners' actual costs.  We also call to drop the refund of third-party compensation.  That is just a sickening inclusion.  I would also seek the dropping of the assignment and subrogation of claims, which is another sickening inclusion, obviously written by departmental mandarins who just want to save money.  The threat of fees for appeals, and the offences and penalties, must also be dropped.  I ask the Government to not infantilise and criminalise the homeowners.<\/p> <p> Only last week we heard the Taoiseach pontificate and attempt to talk down to Opposition Members saying, stating: \"Since I was elected to this House, [I have] seen it primarily as a legislative assembly.\"  I will never understand how he manages to get such statements out of his mouth even as we partake in this farce today.  It takes some neck but I suppose a hard neck is what one gets having been in here for years.<\/p> <p> I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State to address in his closing remarks - not that he will address them but I will ask them anyway.  Does he intend to consider any of the Opposition amendments, seeing as the Government failed to table any?  Is the Minister of State planning to vote them all down?  Will he sit down with Opposition spokespersons and homeowners on Monday, for one last time, to go through the amendments and decide what the Government will accept?  Will he give either of those commitments, for whatever that is worth?  I do not think so.  I have little faith left in the Government and less this week than last, and it was a low bar at that stage.  This is a mean-spirited thing being done here today with this legislation.  It is being dressed up as a &euro;2.3 billion scheme.  It will actually probably end up being a &euro;6 billion scheme because the scheme will have to come back for a third attempt at legislation to sort this out.  It will cost a hell of a lot more at that stage because the Government has arsed about and made sure that people are not listened to.  This is a sad reflection of the whole thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022063000041#WW00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656599400,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I welcome that the Bill is finally being brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

Very few of us can imagine what it must be like for those who have been in the situation that affects homeowners in Clare, Mayo, Donegal and other parts of the State.  These people are struggling to pay mortgages.  Everyone is struggling to pay their mortgage and it is going to get worse next winter.  Imagine having that home crumble around you and wonder whether you have any comeback.  Where and how does such a homeowner come back?  A person would need the wherewithal, the financial reserves and mental reserves to take on one of the biggest companies in the country, a company with huge tentacles around the world, including into the political elite of Ireland.  For the affected homeowners, feeling that they are very much left on their own must be truly horrendous from a mental health perspective.
