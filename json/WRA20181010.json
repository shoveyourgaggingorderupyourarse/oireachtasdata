The publication on Monday of the IPCC Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5\u2070C highlights in stark terms the urgency of managing our global trajectory of emissions. The scale and complexity of this challenge demands a coordinated approach at both national and international levels. Ireland is committed to concerted multilateral action to tackle climate change through the Paris Agreement and to working with our EU and global partners in achieving the objectives of the Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to hold the g<font color=\"#222222\">lobal average temperature increase to well below 2 &deg;C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1.5 &deg;C.<\/font><\/p><p>The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the Agreement. Ireland will contribute via the NDC submitted by the EU on behalf of its Member States, and which commits the EU to a 40% reduction in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. In this context, the EU has\u00a0undertaken to reduce emissions in sectors covered\u00a0by the Emissions Trading System (ETS)\u00a0\u00a0by 43%, and has agreed binding annual targets for each Member State for those emissions falling outside the ETS. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction on 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. <\/p><p>Ireland's National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, sets out the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February 2018\u00a0of the National Development Plan, will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. In accordance with the framework provided by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Government must prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. This Statement also serves as a progress report on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan. <\/p><p>I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years. The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.  I propose to initiate shortly the process of updating the current Plan in order to facilitate the detailed policy design required to realise the high-level of ambition articulated in the National Development Plan as well as to develop further cost-effective policy options to address Ireland's targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. This process will also be informed by Ireland&rsquo;s National Energy and Climate Plan, and by a new long-term low emissions strategy, both of which Ireland must prepare and finalise by the end of 2019 under the EU Clean Energy Package. I intend that the long-term strategy will further elaborate sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050, as set out in the National Policy Position.<\/p><p>In line with the decision of the European Council of October 2014 on the EU's overall commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, Ireland has fully supported this level of ambition in recent negotiations to reform the EU ETS and to put in place Member State targets for non-ETS sectors under the EU Effort Sharing regulation. In addition, Ireland has also supported the\u00a0high ambition for the proposals under the EU Clean Energy Package, while seeking to ensure that individual requirements on EU Member States would be fair, affordable and technically achievable. <\/p><p>Ireland also continues to support high ambition in ongoing negotiations at EU level in relation to emissions standards for both Light- and Heavy Duty Vehicles.

Energy efficiency will also realise benefits for air quality, health, social inclusion, business competitiveness and better public services, all of which will make a real and positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives.  Exchequer investment of &euro;4 billion, along with taxation and regulatory measures, are provided for under the NDP to\u00a0drive the step change in energy performance in the residential sector.<\/p>  <p>  Currently Government is funding just under 30,000 home energy efficiency upgrades per annum to an average BER of C. The NDP ambition is to increase grant supported energy efficient renovations to circa 45,000 to a BER of B from 2021.<\/p>  <p>  A number of actions which are outlined in the National Mitigation Plan and Long Term Renovation Strategy are already underway to achieve these levels of retrofit and promote deep retrofit of buildings across all building types and tenure. Those actions which relate specifically to homes are as follows:<\/p>  <p>- The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home. Fixed grants are provided towards the cost of a range of measures such as insulation, heating controls and solar thermal technology. I recently expanded this scheme to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and achieve greater energy savings and emissions reductions, by providing a grant for heat pumps and increasing the funding for external insulation.<\/p>  <p>- The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. I recently announced the expansion of the scheme to include internal and external wall insulation in order to increase the number of people that can receive upgrades and increase the energy savings and emissions reductions the scheme can achieve by enabling fuel switching.<\/p>  <p>- The Better Energy Communities scheme allows groups of buildings to apply for funding to improve their energy efficiency. This scheme has resulted in innovative approaches to renovation being developed, while also contributing to the overall reduction of energy usage and emissions from our building stock.<\/p>  <p>  To build on what has been achieved through these schemes, and understand how we make the step change necessary to achieve the NDP ambition, we already gathering the real world evidence through two flagship projects, both of which follow international best practice:<\/p>  <p>- The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme, which began in 2017 and will conclude at the end of 2019, is investigating how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER), while building consumer demand and contractor capacity for deep retrofit. Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit. This will inform a model that can make deep retrofit available to individual homeowners on a larger scale post 2020, and critically will help Ireland move away from fossil fuels to clean renewable heating systems, such as solar and heat pumps.<\/p>  <p>- The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme, funded by my Department, is a joint policy initiative with the Department of Health, and is operated by SEAI and the HSE. It began in 2016 and this first phase will conclude at the end of this year. It is measuring the health and wellbeing impacts associated with improved energy efficiency. Not only is this evidence needed to make a robust business case for further public investment, it is critical for how we communicate the benefits of climate action. Increasing public understanding of the multiple benefits of energy efficiency is critical to motivate people to invest in, and make their contribution to, action on climate change.<\/p>  <p>  While it is necessary to tailor offerings for the different circumstances of householders, the common goal of these actions is to drive the step change we need in energy performance, skills, capacity and investment, and understand how we build demand, grow the supply chain and offer attractive financing to leverage public investment and empower citizens to act on climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000075#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":23,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000075#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[41204\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000075#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which Ireland's commitments to climate action and carbon reduction as per international agreements remain likely to be on time; the extent to which corrective measures may be necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406\/2009\/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.<\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.   While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.<\/p>  <p>  The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets. Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.\u00a0 While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel, I am putting in place a number of additional measures to seek to close the gap to compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s targets under both the Effort Sharing Decision and the Renewable Energy Directive. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to biofuels, in May of this year, I signed an order increasing the obligation rate of fuel suppliers from the current level of 8% by volume to a level of 10% by volume which will come into effect from 1 January 2019.

This is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040 and it will have an allocation of at least &euro;500 million over the period to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  I secured Government approval in July for the high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The new Scheme has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework.

These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) produces national greenhouse gas emission projections on an annual basis. These projections are compiled to meet EU reporting obligations and to inform national policy development. The preparation of EPA projections is a collaborative process with input from a range of State bodies and Government Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.<\/p>  <p>  The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets. Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.\u00a0 While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. <\/p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society.

The EU Effort Sharing Regulation, which entered into force on 9 July 2018, sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in non-ETS emissions (compared to 2005 levels) by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the EPA in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's National Mitigation Plan (NMP), published in 2017, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan sets out the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. Building on the NMP, the publication in February 2018\u00a0of the National Development Plan (NDP), will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Energy White Paper presents a long-term strategic vision that is intended to guide the direction of energy policy from now until 2030. The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a02009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.\u00a0 Good progress has been made to date, but the\u00a0target remains challenging, particularly in light of economic growth and a growing demand for energy.\u00a0\u00a0Latest\u00a0data from\u00a0the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)\u00a0indicates that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources, with an expectation that\u00a0Ireland will achieve\u00a0a range of\u00a0 potentially up to 90% by 2020. The SEAI has also estimated that the contribution of renewables avoided &euro;276 million of fossil fuel imports in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has also\u00a0adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes.\u00a0\u00a0In addition,\u00a0my Department is developing the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable energy contributions out to 2030; and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), the purpose of which is to reduce the use of fossil fuels within the heating sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000075#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":59,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[41175\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the way in which the development of a liquefied natural gas facility here would be compatible with the State's commitment to tackling climate change; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.<\/p><p>The development of an LNG facility would further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s gas security of supply by increasing import route diversity and would be compatible with the State&rsquo;s commitments to tackle climate change.

commercial waste management compliance has been a National Waste Enforcement Priority for 2017 and 2018. During this period, the focus of this priority for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) has been the roll out of the household food waste bin. From their inception in 2016, the WERLAs have coordinated local authority actions by way of compliance assistance and enforcement to support the effective roll out of the household food waste bin in the required agglomerations in accordance with the legislation, and this work is on-going. The provision of a brown bin collection service, where it is technically and environmentally practical to do so, continues to be monitored by my Department, together with the regulatory authorities and industry representatives.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the household collection model and structure, the CCPC, in its report, acknowledged the work of the Price Monitoring Group (PMG), which I established in July 2017, to monitor prices for consumers offered by the waste sector as flat fees were being phased out. It has confirmed that consumers have seen price stability across the sector over the last 12 months with no evidence of price gouging. <\/p>  <p>  The findings of this report also support the approach that I have taken to introduce an incentivised pricing model, rather than a blanket pay-by-kilogramme system as previously proposed. The report shows that household waste collection costs are on average between 63 and 77 cents per day.<\/p>  <p>  The CCPC does not call for a one-size-fits-all type of regulatory approach. In fact, it advises that, based on data collection and consultation, different competition models can be introduced for different geographic areas. The CCPC&rsquo;s findings also state that the current regulatory system needs to be developed to address market structure, customer needs, and environmental targets.<\/p>  <p>  The nature of the market is complex, as both the CCPC and the PMG have identified. Therefore, the findings of this CCPC report must be studied with care and diligence to ensure that consumer wellbeing is protected and that our environmental goals are met. This will require extensive work to be done in relation to data gathering and analysis before any decisions are made in relation to changes to the market structures. This may be a role for a national regulatory authority, as suggested in the CCPC report. The hybrid model suggested could also help to extend the coverage of door-to-door collections nationwide, while ensuring better value for money for the householder and providing certainty for investment by the waste sector.<\/p>  <p>  This report, combined with the on-going work of the PMG, and the finalisation of the European Circular Economy waste legislation framework, will inform the development of a future waste management policy, including our environmental goals, regulatory and market structures, and policy instruments and tools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Copyright Infringement","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[41226\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to publish a task force on digital piracy.

An overhead line provides the opportunity for investment along the route of the line and offers a far more balanced electricity network across this country and across this island.<\/p>  <p>  On the report into the comparative international practice in relation to compensation, that report indicates that Ireland has a comparatively generous compensation regime in place.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to publishing the reports on my Department's website, I have forwarded copies of the two Reports to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Prices","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB02650"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[41192\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to use his powers under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to issue a policy direction to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities regarding energy supply markets and its resultant effect on prices for householders.","asker":"1232","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>The Government, or I as Minister, have no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of electricity prices.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the gas or electricity markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). It is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. Under the current Oireachtas Committee formations, the CRU is responsible to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment where these matters are discussed as the Committee sees fit.<\/p>  <p>  Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.<\/p>  <p>  One of Commission&rsquo;s statutory functions is to carry out market monitoring to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition. As part of its market monitoring work, CRU last year concluded that Irish energy markets are competitive. <\/p>  <p>  Recent announcements regarding electricity price increases reflect that since the final quarter of 2016, average international natural gas prices have increased sharply. They have, more or less, continued to rise through 2017 and on to Quarter 3 2018, with day ahead prices in August \u00a0being 50% higher than 12 months earlier. Consistent with the upward international gas price trend, average wholesale electricity prices have increased in like manner. After an initial delay, the effect of this protracted rise in the wholesale electricity price since end 2016 has been observed in the retail market, with all significant Irish electricity suppliers announcing household customer price increases.<\/p>  <p>  Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, sets out the procedure under which I, as\u00a0Minister,\u00a0may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo;. The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia restrictions, timelines and consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas.\u00a0Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which Member States must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities, which are expressively forbidden from taking direct instructions from government, or any public body. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package.\u00a0 A policy direction in this matter is therefore not being considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000076#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":96,"content":"<p>Question No. 45 answered with Question No. 32.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000077#WRC00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Review","counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000077#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":99,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[41323\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000077#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 75 of 3 October 2018, if the gap analysis of skills sets in the Permanent Defence Forces has commenced; when it will conclude; and the steps that will be taken following this gap analysis to address skills gaps.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":100,"content":"<p>As I stated previously, the White Paper on Defence sets the defence policy agenda up to 2025 and includes the identification of some 90 projects\/actions to be implemented on a phased basis over the lifetime of the programme.<\/p><p>The project referred to entails a gap analysis of skill sets within the Permanent Defence Force to identify the frequency of gaps and appropriate measures to address them.

I am advised by Revenue that its criterion to be considered a HWI and come within the management of the HWI Units of its Large Cases Division is individuals with net assets of over &euro;50 million. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there is no statutory obligation on individuals to return details of their net worth on returns of income. Accordingly, Revenue does not have the data required to estimate the number of individuals with a net worth within the thresholds requested. <\/p><p>Revenue has had a focus on High Wealth Individuals (HWIs) over a long period. HWIs have been managed by dedicated units within its Large Cases Division since it was established in 2003. Revenue has recently split its Large Cases Division into two divisions, one of which will now focus on HWIs, avoidance and pensions. The new Division is in the process, as reflected in one of the recommendations in the Annual Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG), of reviewing the case base with a view to increasing the number of HWIs managed in the Division. The allocation of resources is a matter for Revenue but I understand that Revenue&rsquo;s structural realignment, of which the setting up of the new Large Cases Division is a part, is being supported by an expansion in the number of specialist and experienced staff assigned to the oversight of the new Division&rsquo;s case base. I also understand that Revenue is also establishing a new Division, the Medium Enterprises Division, to manage the affairs of the tier of cases, both corporate and individuals below the Large Cases Division. <\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the case base of the dedicated units within its Large Cases Division is adjusted periodically but not necessarily on an annual basis. The following Table provides the number of HWIs managed in the Division for the years indicated:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number of HWIs<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>571<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>480<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that cases not previously or currently meeting the criteria for inclusion in its Large Cases Division were and are subject to ongoing risk evaluation and, where necessary, intervention programmes. Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to managing compliance is to make the appropriate intervention following appraisal of the risk factors in each case. This applies to all taxpayers including those not within the responsibility of Large Cases Division. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that the structural realignment being advanced by Revenue combined with the use by Revenue of the powers available to them will continue to deliver an outcome where HWIs pay the appropriate tax in accordance with the legislation.  Finally, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to estimate additional audit yield related to cases not currently within the responsibility of Revenue&rsquo;s LCD. However, Revenue has pointed out that in the first instance there is a presumption of honesty regarding the behaviour of taxpayers who pay on a self-assessment basis and no category of taxpayer would be regarded, in advance of a case appraisal, as likely to give rise to audit yield. Secondly, all taxpayers are subject to risk evaluation and intervention as appropriate so bringing a particular category of taxpayers within the remit of the Large Cases Division would not, of itself, be a determinant of an increased audit yield.  <\/p><p>Over the last number of Budgets\/Estimates process I supported the business case put forward by Revenue in relation to additional resources, both personnel and ICT, and I will continue to examine any proposal put forward by Revenue in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000077#WRC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000077#WRC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[41495\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000077#WRC04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 281 of 17 April 2018, his plans to introduce tax relief on membership subscriptions to trade unions as applies to costs for membership or subscriptions to professional bodies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question in April last, a review of the appropriate treatment for tax purposes of trade union subscriptions and professional body fees was carried out by my Department in 2016, and included in the 2016 report on tax expenditures published on Budget day 2016.<\/p><p>The review concluded that:<\/p><p>&quot;... <i>analysis of the scheme using the principles laid down by the Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines shows that it fails to reach the evaluation threshold to warrant introduction in this manner. <\/i><\/p><p><i>The reinstatement of this tax relief would have no justifiable policy rationale and does not express a defined policy objective.

The Bill is being treated as a priority and the intention is to secure enactment of the legislation as early as possible in the current term.<\/p>  <p>  Once the Bill is enacted and commenced, the majority of public servants recruited prior to 1 April 2004 will have a new compulsory retirement age of 70. For the most part, these public servants currently have a compulsory retirement age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  Until the commencement of the Bill, the current compulsory retirement age continues to apply and public servants reaching the age of 65 are required to retire.  To accommodate public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision to increase the retirement age and the commencement of the necessary legislation, I arranged for the introduction of interim arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The interim arrangements must respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65. They provide a temporary solution to affected public servants by allowing them to be re-hired for a period of one year, until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (66).  Their new employment contracts make provision for this arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  The general policy across the public service is that, where a retired employee is re-hired, they are paid at the minimum point of the relevant scale, rather than at the pay point they had reached when they retired.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS educational psychologists undertake some 8,000 such referrals for individual casework annually to investigate concerns raised, in the main by schools, in relation to the educational, social or emotional development of those pupils. <\/p>  <p>  Such interventions are undertaken with parental consent and are documented in a client record maintained within NEPS. This process is predominantly a paper based one and informs the ongoing and future intervention with the child throughout their school career.

Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. <\/p><p>The new Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed to provide objective information to all parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. <\/p><p>The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG). Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision. The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes will be made available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>The patronage process commenced in June 2018 for the four new post-primary schools to be established in 2019. The patronage process for the remaining schools, including the new post-primary school referred to by the Deputy, will also be run at a later date, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website () and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie).<\/p><p>In line with the policy on the use of State assets (Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circulars 11\/15 and 17\/16), my Department will be seeking to maximise the use of sites already in my ownership and of available properties in the ownership of other State bodies, where these are considered suitable.  <\/p><p>In addition as part of my Department's ongoing engagement with Local Authorities in respect of statutory planning processes and under the MoU on school site acquisitions, my Department will be examining all potential suitable site options, including appropriately zoned sites, to serve the relevant areas. <\/p><p>Taking into account all of the above, decisions will then be made as part of the site acquisition process in relation to appropriate sites for all the schools announced including the new post primary school referred to by the Deputy, and will be confirmed at the earliest possible date. Once a site has been secured, the architectural planning process to provide permanent accommodation for the school can be initiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000078#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":189,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000078#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":190,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[41396\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000078#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of school building projects for schools (details supplied) in Dublin 24.","asker":"1311","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":191,"content":"<p>The school building project for the schools referred to by the Deputy is currently at Tender Stage.

It may have been reasonable when these schools were originally established for a school to assume that its pupil population was predominately Catholic and to arrange religious instruction accordingly. However, this is no longer an appropriate approach. In a changing context the constitutional right not to attend religious instruction must be given effect through changed practices.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has issued a further circular to schools clarifying the requirements set out previously. The first key clarification is that where a school intends to provide religious instruction\/faith formation, parents must give consent before admission to the class. This means that opt out does not arise because the parent has requested a place in the religious instruction class. The other significant clarification is that classes following the NCCA Religious Education syllabuses cannot have any element of religious instruction or worship, which also means that opt out does not arise. <\/p>  <p>  Religious Education is an examinable subject just like History or Geography for example. It aims to develop the students&rsquo; ability to examine questions of meaning, purpose and relationships, to help students understand, respect and appreciate people&rsquo;s expression of their beliefs, and to facilitate dialogue and reflection on the diversity of beliefs and values that inform responsible decision-making and ways of living. Crucially, it is not delivered from any one religious perspective.

Individuals are also offered supports to access opportunities which are based on their skills and interests. <\/p>  <p>  It is agreed that 23.5 IPS Employment Specialists will be recruited by employment agencies, with one additional post funded through Service Reform Fund general grant funding for a total of 24.5 positions. All posts will be in place by the end of quarter 4, 2018. There are an additional 5 Early Intervention in Psychosis posts which will also be in place by the end of quarter 4, 2018. The Early Intervention in Psychosis program will share a number of activities with the general IPS rollout including training, fidelity reviews and resources. <\/p>  <p>  To facilitate the roll-out of the IPS Employment Specialists: <\/p>  <p>  - An IPS steering group has been established.<\/p>  <p>  - Meetings have been held with DEASP, Employment Agencies and the National Occupational Therapist Managers group and they have agreed to the implementation and management of IPS at local level. <\/p>  <p>  - An SLA has been agreed to govern this.

As of the 5th of October 2018, there are 12 Service Level Agreements (with 13 associated posts) signed.

This level of funding is consistent with the amounts provided for the last four years.<\/p><p>The remit of the Drugs Task Forces was extended to include the problem of alcohol misuse in 2014, in view of the central role they play in coordinating the response to substance misuse at local level.

By the end of 2017, 16 of the 24 Task Forces had participated on the Central Training Programme.  <\/p><p>I recently announced a further &euro;290,000 for Task Forces to support and enhance services addressing drug and alcohol misuse.

On average this would give a payback of around 9 years.<\/p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has structured this grant support based on detailed analysis of costs and willingness to pay research, and the grant level (30-35% overall installation costs)\u00a0is in line with other grants offered by the SEAI.\u00a0It is in the interest of \u00a0each homeowner to increase self-consumption of the generated solar energy in\u00a0the home, and by linking the additional grant scheme with battery storage, the scheme is tailored to encourage this.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme will be subject to a six month review which will examine the uptake and the level of the grant, assess the costs associated with the technology and explore opportunities for broadening the scheme as appropriate. My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro-generation sector and the SEAI to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner. <\/p>  <p>  Micro generation,\u00a0was also appraised as part of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) economic assessment. The analysis identified a number of challenges that may need to be addressed before a financial support scheme (payment) for micro generation can be developed. These include a reform of network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the PSO (cost burden sharing), and development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking the benefits of self-consumption into account. This approach is in line with experience from other EU member states who have attempted to introduce supports for micro generation.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will\u00a0appreciate that in developing and expanding\u00a0 renewable energy support schemes\u00a0 that a careful balance must be struck between the subsidy to\u00a0 renewable generators and the additional costs to pay for these schemes that are transferred to\u00a0 electricity bill payers.

The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development sets out an ambitious long-term commitment to transition to a competitive, low carbon, climate resilient economy and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors. In parallel, the National Policy Position commits to pursing an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. <\/p><p>The enactment, in December 2015, of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, provides the statutory basis for the national transition objective, for the development and submission to Government for approval of a series of National Mitigation Plans and National Adaptation Frameworks, and for independent advisory and Oireachtas accountability arrangements.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s first National Mitigation Plan was published in July 2017 and provides a framework to guide Government investment decisions in measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from four key sectors: Electricity Generation; Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use.<\/p><p>The Plan set out 106 actions and 60 measures to reduce our emissions. It is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; which is being updated on an on-going basis as analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.<\/p><p>I subsequently published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. Under the Framework, seven Government Departments and Agencies, with responsibility for the twelve priority sectors identified in the Framework, are required to submit sectoral adaptation plans to Government for approval by 30 September 2019. <\/p><p>Furthermore, recognising the significant obligation which has been placed on the Local Authority sector to develop and implement its own climate action measures, I provided funding to establish and develop four Local Authority Climate Action Regional Offices. These offices will ensure links between sectors and provide expertise and capacity at local and regional level to contribute effectively to the national transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy. <\/p><p>The publication of the National Development Plan in February of this year represented a step-change in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to climate change, with &euro;21.8 billion in funding directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society. This is in addition to major further investment of &euro;8.6 billion in sustainable transport, including the DART expansion, Metro Link and the Bus Connects programme. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. I am taking a number of immediate steps to achieve maximum emissions reduction to seek to address Ireland&rsquo;s targets for 2020 and to prepare us for the more challenging targets that Ireland will face for 2030. <\/p><p>In relation to biofuels, in May of this year, I signed an order increasing the obligation rate of fuel suppliers from the current level of 8% by volume to a level of 10% by volume which will come into effect from 1 January 2019. I intend to further increase this obligation to 11% by volume from 1 January 2020 and also carry out a public consultation next year in relation to further increases in the post-2020 period.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In order to promote further penetration of electric vehicles, I have secured Government support to expand the range of measures in place drive the electrification of transport, adding home charger support, Benefit in kind enhancement, toll reduction and support to the taxi\/hackney sector.<\/p><p>I opened the first phase of the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat for applications on 12 September.\u00a0 This phase provides a grant of up to 30% of the installation cost of a heat pump system in non-domestic applications.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I launched the first call for applications for the Climate Action Fund on 9 July. This is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040 and it will have an allocation of at least &euro;500 million over the period to 2027.<\/p><p>I secured Government approval in July for the high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The new Scheme has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The first RESS auction will deliver &lsquo;shovel ready&rsquo; projects, reducing the gap to 2020 and assisting in the early delivery for our trajectory to 2030.<\/p><p>In relation to the reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on fossil fuels, the latest available data, published\u00a0in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland report, Energy in Ireland 2016, indicates that total displacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy resulted in approximately &euro;342 million in fossil fuel imports being avoided in 2016, leading to a saving of 3.9 million tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.

The report states that we are already seeing the consequences of 1&deg;C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes.<\/p>  <p>  The impacts for Ireland are in line what we are seeing globally. In 2017 the EPA published its second &ldquo;State of Knowledge&rdquo; report on climate change impacts for Ireland. While uncertainties remain on the exact scale of the impacts, it is becoming apparent that trends in the temperature and precipitation records as well as those relating to sea level and ecosystems are a cause for concern and that these trends are set to continue. <\/p>  <p>  In January of this year I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework (NAF) which represents our national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. The Framework sets out the context to ensure local authorities, regions and sectors can assess the key risks and vulnerabilities of climate change, implement climate resilience actions, and ensure climate adaptation considerations are mainstreamed into all local, regional and national policy making. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Framework, seven Government Departments with responsibility for twelve priority sectors are required to prepare sectoral adaptation plans in line with the requirements of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The deadline for the submission of sectoral adaptation plans to Government for approval is 30 September 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Local understanding is also crucial to getting adaptation right and my Department has made a funding commitment of &euro;10 million over five years to establish four local authority Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs). These offices will underpin a risk-based approach to climate action at the local and regional level and will provide a coordinated response to climate change, both in terms of adaptation and mitigation. Local authorities are also required to have local authority adaptation strategies in place by 30 September next year. To assist these key sectors with their respective planning processes I published &ldquo;Sectoral Planning Guidelines for Climate Change Adaptation&rdquo; in May of this year and later this year I intend to publish revised climate adaptation planning guidance for local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is an iterative process, with the National Adaptation Framework to be reviewed at least once every five years in line with the 2015 Climate Act. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Departments, Agencies and local authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions as appropriate as climate projections are updated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000084#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":536,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000084#WRK04700"},{"type":"question","counter":537,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[41502\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000084#WRK04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he remains satisfied in regard to the programme to deliver high quality high-speed broadband on par with the best available internationally through all areas throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[41503\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018101000084#WRK04900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of households provided with adequate broadband facilities throughout the country; his plans to extend services to current or anticipated black spots; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 and 203 together.<\/p><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims to ensure high speed broadband access (minimum 30 megabits per second) to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location.

I do not have\u00a0statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments\u00a0in particular locations. The ComReg\u00a0consumer helpline is accessible at consumerline@comreg.ie and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator. <\/p>  <p>  With respect to the quality\u00a0of mobile telephony service in other countries, comparisons\u00a0between Member States and\u00a0within regions\u00a0can be\u00a0problematic for many reasons, including the fact\u00a0that the\u00a0technical characteristics of\u00a0mobile phone networks that determine coverage and\u00a0capacity will vary between\u00a0operators and\u00a0locations. Other\u00a0factors would include\u00a0the\u00a0characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect. Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.\u00a0The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in\u00a0December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the deficits. The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.<\/p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that\u00a0will\u00a0lead to improvements for\u00a0consumers across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to identifying the areas across the country that do not have adequate coverage,\u00a0both my\u00a0Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development\u00a0have worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been\u00a0included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various other\u00a0initiatives are under way:<\/p>  <p>  - Both Departments\u00a0have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. <\/p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.<\/p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State \u00a0and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem\u00a0with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness,\u00a0allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.<\/p>  <p>  - Following a consultation process ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.<\/p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.
