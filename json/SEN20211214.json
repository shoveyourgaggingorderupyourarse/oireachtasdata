I know she has a very busy portfolio and that this is not in her brief.  I appreciate her taking the time to answer this Commencement matter.  Before I start into the merits of it, I will give the Minister of State the context of it.  I am a big advocate of electric vehicles and of the charging infrastructure, and I was amazed a couple of weeks ago when I came across what I found to be a strange anomaly, that is, in Ireland one can only avail of an electric vehicle home charging point if one has a private driveway.  That is simple enough because if one has a private driveway, one can take the car in and plug it in.  However, that rules out thousands of people in this country, including people who live in apartment blocks, on terraced streets or anybody who does not have a private driveway.<\/p> <p>We are at the beginning of this type of technology but we have seriously ambitious targets to have 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030.  That is just eight years away, within approximately 20 days' time.  What I hope to get from Government is a solution to the problem.  What are we planning to do to try to ensure people who live in apartment blocks or terraced houses and who do not have access to private driveways can access charging points?<\/p> <p>Some of the new regulations, as the Minister of State will be aware, include regulations under which newly built apartment blocks must have a certain number of electric vehicle charging points, and that is fair enough.  That goes perhaps some way in trying to solving the problem in private housing estates.  Another thing that can happen is that a management company can decide to put in a couple of charging points, although this can be very difficult because management companies do not want to do it.  We want to get to a stage where everyone in this country has an electric vehicle, so it is not going to be feasible for hundreds of charging points to be put into estates.  We need something where every home owner can have access.  If it is the case that it cannot be physically attached from the home to the car, we need to come up with new forms of technology to get around this.<\/p> <p>Talking about new technology, one thing we could look into is what they are doing in Germany at the moment which is interesting.  There have been trials where an electric vehicle can connect into an electric light on a street and charge from that light.  That means somebody living in a terraced house in Dundalk or anywhere in the country who is not able to block a public pathway or footpath by connecting the car to the house could plug into an ESB pole and take some of the electricity from that for a point in time.  It is a new technology in Germany and it is something that could resolve the problem.<\/p> <p>The future is bright for electric vehicles.  I have no doubt that in the next couple of years we are going to see a reduction in the cost of electric vehicles and an increase in the range of electric vehicles and the distances they can go.  When the ranges in electric vehicles increase it will reduce the need for chargers at the same time.  The reason I brought forward this Commencement matter today is that we are excluding many thousands of people in this country from the use of an electric vehicle and from having a home charging point by their lack of a private driveway.  I hope the Government can offer some solutions on what its plans are and how we hope to resolve this anomaly at some stage in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#B00350","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the warm welcome, as always.  I also thank Senator McGahon for raising this important matter.  The Senator outlined very well how access to a driveway or garden system rules out electric vehicle ownership for thousands of people and homeowners.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who are unable to be here as they are both in Cabinet.<\/p> <p>The Government' s policy regarding the increased usage of electric vehicles, EVs, is primarily driven by the Climate Action Plan 2021, which sets a target of 945,000 EVs by 2030.  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years.  A national charging infrastructure strategy is due for publication early next year and will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030.  An effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric.  Not having access to a charging point cannot be a deterrent to people owning an electric vehicle.  Where it is, people are certainly not going to consider moving to an electric vehicle when choosing a car.  Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge.  Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to move towards more energy-efficient and sustainable ways to charge.<\/p> <p>The EV home charger grant scheme is available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600.  However, as stated by the Senator, there are houses and dwellings in Ireland where home charging is not an option due to the lack of a driveway or garden.  As such, there is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible, including on-street and residential charging, destination charging and workplace charging.<\/p> <p>In terms of existing supports for public charging, the public charge point scheme has been in place since September 2019 and continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers.  I note with interest the Senator&rsquo;s point about Germany&rsquo;s use of lamp-posts for the purpose of charging EVs, which appears to me to be a perfectly reasonable aspiration.  The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure, which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles who do not have access to a private parking space but who instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.<\/p> <p>The Department of Transport is currently reviewing the scheme to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving forward the national decarbonisation effort and is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including local government, to ensure that the charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand.  This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the programme for Government, which will ensure that we can continue to expand our national charging network through supports for on-street chargers.<\/p> <p>The Department is aware that a report was published by the County and City Management Association which contains guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure.  The document is available for viewing online.  Meanwhile, work is being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant in such a way as to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments.  The Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#C00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the very comprehensive reply.

That goes a long way towards trying to resolve the very issue that I have raised.  I am glad to hear that response from Government today.  However, as stated by the Minister of State, we have to make sure that we minimise the deterrents.  For a person to choose to purchase an electric vehicle, it has to be as simple as possible.  If I want to buy an electric vehicle but I note that my nearest charging point is half way up the town or two estates away where there are only two spaces that are always in use, I will not make the move to an electric vehicle.

I appreciate that the Minister is at a Cabinet meeting this morning and otherwise engaged but this is an issue of fundamental concern to, I think, all of us.  As I said last week, there are tens of thousands of journeys made across the Border each day.  There are thousands of people living in this State who are non-Irish EU citizens and, indeed, many who are not from the EU.  The Nationality and Borders Bill could be quite severe in its implications for their ability to freely move across this island.<\/p> <p>We must remember that although the component parts of the approach to the withdrawal agreement and Brexit were multifaceted, one of them was that there would be no return to a hard border on this island.  I am of the view there should be no Border on this island.  The sooner we get rid of the Border, the better it will be for all of us.  That is especially apparent now.  The approach was not that there would be no return to a hard border for some.  That there should be no return to a hard border for the Minister of State or me but that there would be a hardening of it for others should cause us all deep concern.  While I find the broader aspects of this particular legislation going through Westminster especially repugnant with respect to what it seeks to do, this has a direct implication for people living in this State and it is crucial the many citizens this could impact on hear what the Government has to say.  There a range of human rights organisations that are also keenly interested in hearing what the Government and, by extension, the EU have to say on this.<\/p> <p>Thus far, it appears the British Government&rsquo;s response has been almost blas&eacute;.  We should not be blas&eacute; about this issue.  There are people who make that journey from the Twenty-six Counties into the Six Counties for work, leisure, study or whatever.  We must ensure those people have the exact same rights as the rest of us.  I am sure the Minister of State would be uncomfortable, as would I, that somebody who has come to live here, made their lives here and contributed significantly to Irish life would have lesser rights than she or I.  Across the Oireachtas and in conjunction with the Government, we need to collectively and collaboratively work to ensure we are articulating our concerns on the international stage but also work hard to try to reverse, if we can, some of the negative, regressive and punitive implications of this legislation on people living here.

I thank the Senator for raising this important matter, which is of great concern.<\/p> <p>The Minister stated that we are closely monitoring the UK's new Nationality and Borders Bill as it progresses through the legislative process in Westminster.  As the Senator will be aware, the Bill was passed in the House of Commons last week and has now proceeded to the House of Lords.<\/p> <p>As currently drafted, the Nationality and Borders Bill would amend the UK's Immigration Act 1971 and potentially provide for a change in the UK's immigration rules, which may require that specified categories of individual - to be set down in the rules - have an electronic travel authorisation, ETA, in order to travel to the UK.  This may include local journeys to the UK from within the common travel area, CTA, that is, travel from Ireland to Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that, while the Bill provides that the ETA requirement may be introduced, any such requirement would be introduced by way of future amendments to the UK's immigration rules.  The UK Government has spoken about the requirement coming into effect by the end of 2024, although this timeframe may be subject to change.<\/p> <p>It is also important to note that the Bill provides that the proposed ETA system will not apply to Irish and British citizens.  It will continue to be the case that, for journeys on and across the island of Ireland, British and Irish citizens will not require any travel documents.  The UK Government has also made clear that there will continue to be no immigration checks on the land Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Irish Government has several concerns regarding how the proposed ETA requirement, if introduced, would apply in the context of Northern Ireland, particularly regarding non-Irish and non-British nationals making local journeys across the land Border from Ireland into Northern Ireland.  As the Senator will be aware, tens of thousands of people, including many non-Irish and non-British nationals living in Ireland, cross the Border every day as they go about their everyday lives visiting friends and family, going to work, studying, shopping and socialising.  It is a shared space.<\/p> <p>There are also considerations in terms of supply chains and for tourism on an all-island basis, should this proposed legislation impact on any cross-Border movements for non-Irish and non-British nationals.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs are therefore engaging with the UK Government to outline these concerns and to seek clarification as to how it is proposed to apply this requirement in Northern Ireland and what changes are intended to be introduced in future immigration rules.<\/p> <p>I was privy to a report a couple of weeks ago which explained that 17% of people living in Ireland were not born here, but Ireland is their home.  That is almost one in five.  This would have a major effect on approximately one in five people who cross the Border on a daily basis for work, education, shopping or whatever else.  The officials in the Department are therefore engaging with the UK Government to outline these concerns and to seek clarification as to how it is proposed to apply this requirement in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#E00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.

The cross-border healthcare directive, as it was once known, was introduced in 2014.  It has proved to be a major success.  Interestingly, only seven people availed of the scheme in 2014, but up-to-date figures indicate almost 15,000 people have availed of healthcare across the Border.<\/p> <p>For many people who are languishing on waiting lists, whether it is for a cataract operation or some other eye procedure, or perhaps a hip or knee replacement, the cross-border health scheme was a complete game changer.  It changed their lives completely and improved their quality of life no end.  Back then, people could go to any EU state to avail of healthcare but, unfortunately, Brexit came along and there were worries that that would be the end of the scheme.  Thankfully, that has proven not to be the case.  The Government moved swiftly last year to introduce an interim scheme, the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme, which allowed people in the Republic to avail of healthcare in Northern Ireland, or elsewhere in the EU, including operations and procedures that were available in the South.  The scheme has continued and it has proved to be very successful<\/p> <p>As I said, the figures speak for themselves.  From 2018 to 2021, cataract procedures proved to be the most popular.  Some 4,131 people availed of those procedures, while 1,413 people had hip replacements and more than 600 people has knee replacements.  On 28 December 2020, the Government moved to sign the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme into law for a 12-month period.  There is now concern because that 12-month period is about to expire.  People are asking what the future of the scheme will be, whether there will be one and who will be entitled to it.  There is uncertainty that needs to be put aside.  We hope that the Minister of State will confirm for us, and the Irish people, that the Northern Ireland healthcare scheme will continue so that people who, unfortunately, have been waiting for procedures for many years will be able to avail of this scheme in future.  <\/p> <p>It is also worth noting that PDFORRA has an arrangement in place with Kingsbridge Private Hospital in Belfast under this scheme.  It is also concerned about what the future of this scheme holds for its members.  I hope the Minister of State will have good news for everyone in the Chamber and will bring clarity to this issue for many of those people who suffer for years as they wait for healthcare procedures, so that they will know that they will be able to continue to avail of healthcare in the North, if that is what they wish to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#F00300","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is in a Cabinet meeting.<\/p> <p>I understand Department officials recently discussed this issue with the Senator and colleagues at the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  As a result of Brexit, the EU cross-border directive ceased to apply in Northern Ireland.  To mitigate this loss, this Government made the important decision to introduce the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme which has been in effective operation since 1 January of this year.  Under this scheme persons resident in the State can access and be reimbursed for private healthcare in Northern Ireland by the HSE, provided such healthcare is publicly available within Ireland.  Therefore, despite the various consequences and challenges which have arisen as a result of Brexit, this scheme continues to ensure that patients have access to healthcare in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>The Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme is currently operating on an interim administrative basis pending the drafting of a general scheme to place it on a statutory footing.  In that regard, Department officials have undertaken a comprehensive analysis to inform the design of the statutory scheme, including detailed consideration of the operation of the current administrative scheme, stakeholder feedback and, helpfully, the recommendations of the Seanad Brexit committee's interim report and feedback from Senators at the most recent committee meeting with officials.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, officials have been engaged with our Northern Ireland counterparts, who have introduced an administrative Republic of Ireland reimbursement scheme to enable patients to access care in this State.  We are examining the parameters of that scheme.  This extensive analysis is continuing at pace and while it will continue into 2022, I assure the Senator that this remains a priority and, importantly, the administrative scheme, which is operating successfully, will remain until a statutory scheme is in place.<\/p> <p>I am confident this assurance will provide certainty for patients that they will continue to access care under the administrative scheme beyond the end of this year.  Further information regarding how to access the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme and be reimbursed for private healthcare in Northern Ireland is on the HSE website.<\/p> <p>It would be helpful to provide the latest data from the HSE.  Those data indicate that almost 4,000 reimbursements have been made so far this year for persons who have continued to access healthcare in Northern Ireland under either the cross-border directive transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme.  This equates to a reimbursement cost in excess of &euro;7 million.  These schemes are primarily servicing a demand for private healthcare in Northern Ireland across the primary specialties of orthopaedics, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, and gynaecology.  As with cataract, hip and knee procedures, for which the Senator provided figures, these are the areas where we are most challenged in relation to waiting lists.  Many people who travel, especially for a cataract operation, can return home on the same day.  That is important.<\/p> <p>I reiterate what the Minister said.

I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the important matter of the HSE advanced paramedic motorbike unit in Cork.  There are two such motorbikes operational in Cork.  The key words are \"operational\" and \"Cork\".  They have been in use for only two of the last 52 weeks.  Why have they been unused and lying idle?<\/p> <p>I am asking the Government and, in particular, the HSE to reinstate the advanced paramedic motorcycle unit in Cork as a matter of urgency.  It saves lives.  Our ambulance service has undergone profound change.  Traditionally, it has been about transporting the patient to hospital.  Today, it is much different.  It is about a care pathway.  Our advanced paramedics have been transformative and have saved lives since their introduction.  The HSE paramedic motorbike unit has been extraordinary in providing a care pathway for people who need one.<\/p> <p>Cork needs these motorbikes back on the road seven days a week.  Response times will improve.  They are operated and trained by highly professional paramedics.  These paramedics can begin treatment and report back before an ambulance arrives.  In cities like Cork, the motorbikes allow ease of navigation through narrow, winding streets.  More important, as the HSE chief executive, Mr. Paul Reid, said in a tweet in July 2019, &ldquo;These guys save people&rsquo;s lives every day\".  He was meeting some of the team in Cork \"Showcasing the new Motorbike unit to support advanced paramedic care in the city.\"<\/p> <p>Paramedic motorbike units provide a rapid response.  They allow early life-saving interventions, do scene management when there are multiple casualties, provide treatment and make referrals to doctors, whether by car or to a surgery or hospital.  They also provide necessary transport to emergency departments and improve response times for the National Ambulance Service.<\/p> <p>Fully qualified paramedics with life-saving skills have saved many lives prior to the arrival of ambulances.  One motorcycle paramedic is a supervisor who can act as an officer in the event of a major incident or if there is an issue with staff.  There is only one motorcycle paramedic which should make it easy for the National Ambulance Service to replace that person.<\/p> <p>A similar situation arose in Dublin but the motorcycle unit there is now back on the road.  It is unacceptable that a city like Cork is not afforded the same level of service.  This is about saving lives.  What is good for the people of Dublin is good for the people of Cork.  If the issue is Covid and the redeployment of staff, there is no better illustration of saving lives than our advanced HSE motorbike paramedic unit.  I ask the Minister of State to exhort the HSE to resume the services of this unit for the people of Cork as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#H00200","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, regarding the provision of NAS motorcycle services in Cork.<\/p> <p>I am sure Senators will join me in paying tribute to the incredible work the NAS has done and continues to do in delivering testing and vaccination services and helping to protect us all since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This work is done in addition to its primary emergency response functions and the dedication of NAS staff to maintaining normal operations wherever possible has been immense.  I think specifically of the early phase of the vaccine roll out when the NAS travelled the byroads of the whole country, administering the vaccine to those who were housebound.<\/p> <p>During periods of normal operation, the NAS has a motorcycle response unit in Cork staffed by two paramedics.  I understand that in order to allow the NAS to maintain essential Covid-19 testing and vaccination work it has been necessary to redeploy both paramedics back to their emergency ambulance response roles, in support of the overall emergency response.  While the motorcycle response unit is not in scheduled operation, the NAS has advised that provision is being made for additional newly qualified staff to be allocated to the NAS south region.  On that basis the NAS anticipates that the motorcycle response unit service should be able to recommence in the short to medium term.<\/p> <p>As well as this specific initiative, I would like to use this opportunity to emphasise to the House the very significant process of reform and modernisation that the NAS has undergone in recent years and continues to undergo.  Several important service innovations aimed at improving emergency ambulance response times and resource availability have already taken place.  This includes the development of alternative pathways of care such as \"see and treat\" and \"hear and treat\" whereby medical staff based in the National Emergency Operations Centre can advise callers on accessing treatment at home, self-care, or referral to other appropriate medical services.  These pathways of care help to divert lower acuity patients away from busy emergency departments and enhance emergency capacity.  In addition, the NAS has developed the intermediate care service to provide lower acuity hospital transfers which frees up emergency ambulances for more urgent calls.  Current data indicates that more than 80% of all inter-hospital transfer requests are now being handled by this service.  These are just a few examples of initiatives that are helping to improve the availability of emergency ambulance resources.<\/p> <p>This year an unprecedented &euro;187 million has been invested in the NAS, of which &euro;10 million is funding for new developments.  This includes the recruitment of some 125 additional staff, which is providing for both increased front-line emergency capacity and enhanced community healthcare initiatives.  As part of budget 2022, &euro;200 million is being invested in the NAS.  This includes a further &euro;8.3 million in new development funding which will help to provide for further capacity resilience in the service as well as in the expansion of alternative care pathways.  This additional investment means that NAS annual funding will have increased by about &euro;30 million since 2019 which is a measure of this Government's commitment to overseeing the successful strategic development of the NAS into a highly agile, mobile medical service in line with the overall aim of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is to provide the right patient care at the right time in the right place.  In that context, Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s point about having a highly agile and mobile medical service is relevant.  I welcome the fact that the NAS anticipates that the motorcycle response unit service should be able to recommence in the short to medium term.  We are all aware of the rapid response these paramedics are able to provide while on motorbikes.  As the Senator said, they can get down very narrow streets and get around blockages, enabling them to respond very quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#J00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

A definite date is required because, as we all know, with the greatest respect, this could linger in HSE never-never land and might never happen.  The service might never resume and we want to avoid that because the HSE paramedic motorbike unit saves lives.  If such a service is allowed to continue in Dublin, despite staffing issues, then the same should apply in Cork.  I ask for equity of treatment because this is about saving lives.  It is about providing this service seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the HSE to get a definitive date.  As Paul Reid tweeted on 18 July 2019, &ldquo;These guys save peoples lives every day&rdquo;.

Equally, it is very important that the message is on the floor of the House that we are very strong supporters of the Irish Sign Language Act.  However, this Act needs to be more than just legislation; it is about how it is enforced and that the Department of Education takes this issue seriously.  It should never be a case that parents of deaf children have to fight to secure rights for their children, in the way that some, including for instance, Mr. Andrew Geary has had to fight for the rights of his son Calum.  I have mentioned in this House before that a young Wexford woman, &Uacute;na Walsh, has been very active.  She has promoted the idea of Irish Sign Language as a second level subject.

This is having a serious impact.  I am not worried about the politics of boxing.  What I am worried about is that for the young people on the ground, the splits in boxing are particularly serious so I ask the Acting Leader to express our concern to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  <\/p><p>I am very proud to come from a family that has a lot of public servants who have worked in nursing and for local authorities.  During this pandemic, a lot of people have given great public service.  I am even thinking of those who processed the pandemic unemployment payments in a very short period of time.  I would like to disassociate myself from the outburst from Deputy Ring in the other Chamber last week.  His attack on the public service was completely unfair.

As most people in politics know, one of those questions we all get asked over this period is whether towns and villages across our counties can get more Christmas lights.  Tipperary has been lucky.  It is getting &euro;35,000, &euro;16,000 of which will go towards Clonmel with the remainder going to Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary town.  It goes a long way to supporting those communities in terms of making them more attractive places to visit during the winter, particularly Christmas.  When one speaks to businesses in small rural towns, where I am from, having a setting like that makes a big difference and encourages people to visit towns to shop locally and spend money.  It is more important than ever this year.  It is a small amount of money but as that sort of money goes a long way and is felt by communities in the towns and villages that receive it, I thank the Minister of State for that.<\/p> <p>The Cahir town centre public realm scheme has been on public display in Tipperary County Council offices in Clonmel, Nenagh and Tipperary town since 10 November.

With applications like this, communication between the county council, businesses and local residents is really important and this is happening.  I got the Minister of State, Deputy English, to visit Cahir a number of months ago to look at the proposals and how they will support tourism, businesses and the community.  Tipperary County Council will make an application to the rural regeneration development fund in the Department of Rural and Community Development on the back of this design.  I really support this application.  Cahir is a beautiful town with a lovely castle that gets a lot of tourists.  Most people outside Tipperary talk about Cashel being a tourist destination, which it is, but Cahir also has significant qualities and can attract a lot of people.

There is no doubt that most of us who work a uniform on either side of the Border were decent, hard-working people who wanted nothing other than security, to protect vital installations and to stop terrorists in their tracks.  However, we must also accept that there was collusion.  On both sides of the Border there were people involved, in the uniform of whichever country they served, who were not working for the good of mankind but were working for terrorists in the background.

Please give it to people who really need it rather than taking &euro;100 they do not particularly need.  There are people in this country to whom &euro;1,000 would mean nothing.

It is going to be here forever.  It is not a by-product of fossil fuels, it is directly made from oil and that is madness.  Children love things that are naturally made as well.  They are much more in tune with their senses than adults are.  They relate to the sound, touch and smell of things so it is good to be aware of that and to try to avoid toxic paints and plastics.

It also raises a number of questions, however, foremost among which is what the students who do not have a place for next year will do.  We have a meeting this evening with the Minister for Education at which I hope some answers will be forthcoming.  It also raises questions about the Educate Together model announced in 2018 for the school and whether that will still be the model.<\/p> <p>It is regrettable that the site is not located in or near the Curragh.  It is in Kildare town.  I and colleagues in the House have spoken previously about the dereliction in the Curragh.  I hope investment will be forthcoming for the Curragh.  The Minister spoke previously of such investment but I now believe that because this secondary school is being taken from the Curragh, we need to concentrate our efforts on developing and investing in the Curragh.<\/p> <p>I raised previously in the House the totally unfair and unacceptable difference in rail prices in County Kildare.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, is engaged in a public consultation on the greater Dublin transport strategy, which will remain open until this coming Friday, 17 December.  I encourage all those who use rail transport in south Kildare to get involved because we need a single pricing structure for the area rather than the various prices that are currently in place.<\/p> <p>In the greater Dublin area, the number of daily rail commuters has increased from 31,000 to 150,000 in 2019 in pre-Covid times.  However, the difference in price for a one-way ticket can be as much as &euro;10 if one compares the &euro;3.80 Leap fare from Sallins in County Kildare to Dublin with the &euro;13.55 fare from Newbridge.  The journey between those two stations is just 13 km.  That difference is totally unacceptable.  Four stations in Kildare, namely, Athy, Monasterevin, Kildare town and Newbridge, are included in this strategy but do not fall under the short hop zone pricing of the other stations in the county.<\/p> <p>Last week, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, confirmed that transport is one of the biggest drivers of the increased cost of living.  A person living in Kildare South can experience this daily, yet even the increased fuel prices will not stop hard-pressed commuters from saving anything up to &euro;200 per month by driving their car to Sallins station and bypassing the four stations in south Kildare.<\/p> <p>If the Government is serious about tackling the climate crisis and promoting public transport, we must create a fair single pricing fare for those living in this area, rather than having the roads approaching the capital turning into ever bigger car parks.  There are a number of important rural transport issues.  I ask for a debate on them early in the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#R00300","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Wall for his impeccable timing.

The new measures will mean that people who live in an apartment block or have off-street parking will be able to avail of the &euro;600 grant to be put towards providing electric vehicles.

He needs to go to the gym four times a week, as recommended by his occupational therapy team, to keep his strength up and now he cannot go at all because the Department of Health and the HSE have not developed a system to allow for a medically exempt vaccine pass.

The sheer volume of people telling me about their hardship in securing the basic amount of home support hours for their loved ones is enormous.  There are people in Longford who must remain in hospitals or nursing homes because of the lack of resources.  Simply put, the care hours are there but there are not enough carers to fill those hours, regardless of whether they are hired by a private operator or through the HSE.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> There has also been an increase in the number of people who have taken on the role of caring for their loved ones.

I do not want to carp about the chaos we have seen with long queues and all the rest of it.  However, I want some degree of Oireachtas supervision and accountability from the HSE as to how the booster programme, which is of vital importance, is being managed.

This happened in Israel and that country has a completely different narrative in terms of a third or fourth wave when compared to what we have.  Of course, we are now talking about doing it but it is two to three weeks later.  What concerns me is whether the Government listens at all to what is being said in the Seanad.  I thought the proposal I made, which was supported by colleagues across the House, was very sensible.  Had it been acted on then the talking would now be over and people would be getting more vaccines.  We are now in a situation where the authorities are coming out with a plan this week but it will be Christmas week before it will be scaled up to the level it should have been scaled up to two weeks ago.

Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about it being National Irish Sign Language Day.  It is important that we recognise this day.  I admit that I do not know any sign language, but the Houses of the Oireachtas have done much work in recent years to promote sign language.  It is great to see that debates on Oireachtas TV are signed.  There has been an amount of work, but we could always do more.  I will raise the matter again at a higher level.<\/p> <p>Senator Byrne also mentioned the rather extraordinary letter from the 62 former and current players from the world of women's rugby.  They referred to the \"substandard commitment from the union, inequitable and untrustworthy leadership, a lack of transparency in the governance and operation of the women's game...and an overall lack of ambition about what it could achieve\".  The IRFU disputes that.  The Senator referred to the committee and I have no doubt the Senator will raise such issues with it.  The two Ministers have been contacted.  I expect that the issues raised in this letter will be pursued with full vigour.  There are a number of reviews going on at present regarding the game and what happened in terms of not reaching the tournament in Parma.  It is important that the two reviews are independently assessed.  I am sure the Ministers will do that.<\/p> <p>The Senator also referred to my colleague, Deputy Ring, and to his outburst.  I have seen some footage of it.  I am sure it was born out of frustration with the system of governance in this country.  It was not disparaging of the public service in its totality.  Like any profession, those in the public service are mostly hard-working, diligent, trustworthy and everything else, but as in every profession - politics included - there are a few people who could and should do better.  I know that from his time as a Minister, the Deputy would tell a few stories about some of the people he came across with whom he had issues.  I do not think he was disparaging of all public servants.  We all have public servants within our families &ndash; I certainly do.  It is good to see Deputy Ring has fight in him again and is expressing his views within the Chamber in Parliament.<\/p> <p>Senator Ahearn referred to funding for Christmas lights, which is very welcome.  It is administered through the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Local Government Fund.  It will assist in reimbursing some of the spend in communities around the country.  At this time of year, it is always great to see beautiful lights in towns and villages.  In a lot of cases that is due to the hard work and effort of volunteers to fundraise in local communities, so any assistance from the local authorities or, in this case, the Local Government Fund, is welcome.  The Senator also referred to the Cahir town centre public realm scheme.  I wish it success in its rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, application.<\/p> <p>Senators Craughwell and &Oacute; Donnghaile talked about the Miami Showband case.  It is an atrocious reality that collusion took place.  In this case, it was between the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers.  Settlement and legal costs were arrived at with the UK Ministry of Defence and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  Collusion is unbelievable, but it is not: it is reality.  It is the reality of what happened in certain locations and this has now been accepted.  Reference was made to collusion on both sides of the Border.  I am not aware of anything on this side, but there may be evidence of which I am not aware.  There are cases.  It is despicable that there was such a misplacement of trust by those who are there to protect us and that it should be so abused.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator Craughwell also touched on the Women of Honour.  I will again talk to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, regarding it.  I know all involved want to get this sorted for the sake of morale and the sake of the people affected.  The Senator also talked about the offering of &euro;100 credit towards electricity bills.  The Cabinet will discuss electricity costs today.  As the Senator knows, if means testing is started with any scheme there is major bureaucracy, so that is not practicable.  I am sure the Cabinet will arrive at a decision today.  The Senator also mentioned that if the &euro;100 is not needed, it could be contributed to charity.  I presume when the Senator said \"charity\" he did not mean Fianna F&aacute;il, which is its new role now, but a more appropriate charity of choice for those who can afford it.  Realistically and importantly, there are people for whom &euro;100 would be very beneficial.  They will not receive it before Christmas but they will know in February, once we get legislation through the Houses, that it will be available.<\/p><p>We all agree with Senator Garvey on supporting local green businesses in the run-up to Christmas, in addition to green initiatives, naturally made products and Christmas stalls, which is all pure common sense.  It is something we need to put in place in all our local communities.  <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile talked about the Nationality and Borders Bill.  It is a very worrying Bill.  Clearly, the UK has a right to defend its borders but, to go back to the whole Brexit debate, we are an island and we share a border with the UK, so it has a particular impact on us and on many non-Irish EU citizens.  It is something we will have to watch.  I did not hear the response of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but I know that he is fully aware and cognisant of the impact of this Bill.<\/p><p>Senator Wall spoke about a local school project.  I understand there will be a meeting with the relevant Minister this evening, which I hope will be fruitful.  It is always important for Ministers to engage, where they can, with local representatives on particular projects.  The Senator also spoke about rail ticket pricing in Kildare.  Equitable and fair rail fares are very important.  Where public transport services are available, it is important that fares are equitable and that we maximise their use.  If price is inhibiting use, that has to be looked at.  There was a welcome initiative in the budget on reduced fares for younger people aged under 23, but it is important that we expedite use of rail and public transport where we can.  I will ask that we have a debate on that issue in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy talked about the entertainment industry, about which I know he is very passionate.  We will have a debate on Thursday on that matter.  As he knows, a range of supports has been announced by the Minister.  I am sure the Senator will get an opportunity on Thursday to engage with the Minister on their roll-out.  There are particular issues with the live performance sector.  It is a very frustrating time of year.  The present restrictions are impacting so much on certain sectors.  The Government has to step in to ensure that support is provided.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke about the financial supports for charging points in apartment complexes.  As we continue to see investment in renewable technologies, such as electric and hybrid vehicles, it is important that we have charging points.  Anything we can learn from the Continent, in this case Germany, such as the use of light fixtures, needs to be looked at.  The rolling out of additional technologies in communities will be very important.  I saw the investment announcement today, but I welcome any and all investment that will make it easier to charge electric cars.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about medical exemptions from Covid passports at Christmas.  I agree that if somebody, and this was always the case, has a medical reason for not wearing a mask or receiving a vaccine that needs to be accounted for.  The Senator mentioned that the scary part is that we are accepting all of this.  Unfortunately, the scary part is that there are still people getting seriously ill and dying from Covid.  We have to continue to encourage people to get vaccinated.  It goes back to the point about the efficient roll-out of the booster vaccine regime, which was raised by a number of Senators.<\/p><p>Senator Carrigy spoke about home supports.  It is a pressing issue.  Historically, we very often had issues with funding for carers and ensuring that we had enough money to support them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The problem now is that we have the funding but there are not enough carers available.  It is a worthy and important profession and will become increasingly important.  As families get smaller and people live longer, we will need more carers.  The profession needs to be more valued than it is.  We need to encourage people into the profession.  That is important.  I will ask for a debate on the matter.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer talked about road deaths and road safety strategy.  In general, there has been a decline of 70% since the first road safety strategy.  Part of that involves the basics of ensuring that we have good tyres on our vehicles, that safety belts are used and that we combat drink- and drug-driving.  That is all important, as well as the safety initiatives taking place in relation to realignment of roads, new road projects and motorways.  They are all safer, which sometimes gets lost in the debate about new road projects.  They are inherently safer than old, substandard roads, as we have seen with motorways.  I will ask for a debate on that in the new year.<\/p><p>Senator Currie made an important contribution regarding Christmas, victims and the antics of Gerry Adams on video over the weekend where, it could be argued, he was trolling victims.  I thought it was a disgrace.  Some have defended him and some have chastised or not defended him.  It was despicable to laugh and joke about \"They haven't gone away, you know\", \"Tiocfaidh &aacute;r l&aacute;\" and that sort of stuff.  It is not right or proper.  There are still people who were disappeared and whose remains have not been found.  Loved ones deserve to get finality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#W00200","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#Y00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#Y00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Senator Ward talked about two of our MEPs and their views on Taiwan and the Uyghur peoples.

Perhaps Mick Wallace will appear at that point.  Ultimately, like all practising politicians, they stand before the electorate, are judged by it and what happens happens.<\/p> <p>Senator Dolan talked about communities.  We know the power of communities coming together to celebrate Christmas.  It is wonderful to hear about the initiatives to which she referred.  The funding for training of education and bridging the digital divide that was announced in recent weeks has been welcomed and there has been additional funding for DEIS schools compared with other schools.  That is extremely important.<\/p> <p>Senators McDowell and Conway talked about the booster campaign.  It is going slower than one would have imagined.  Unlike the start of the first campaign when the problem was clearly supply of vaccines, we are now told supply is not the issue.  It is just about ramping up delivery.  On one hand, it is not right that people are queueing for long periods; on the other, it is good to see the huge level of interest in getting the third dose of vaccine.  The Senators are right that it could be rolled out more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Regarding the committee, that would have to be considered.  I will bring it to higher levels of Government.  The original special committee was established before this House was fully constituted in the interregnum between the election and the formation of the Government, and before the Oireachtas committees were up and running.  There was an all-party committee chaired by Deputy McNamara, who did a tremendous job, putting in a lot of work over summer 2020 during the initial response to Covid.  Whether there is an appetite to go back to that or not is uncertain.  The argument for disbanding the committee was, first, that it had done much work and possibly had fulfilled its role and, second, that the sectoral committees would fill the vacuum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#Y00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>They have not done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#Y00500","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>There is the health committee and there is the business committee in the context of business supports and all of that.

79 concerns the issuing of a maritime area consent.  My amendment continues:<\/p><blockquote>\t(b) <i>Section 79 <\/i>shall be excluded from any commencement order&mdash;  \t(i) until the Minister has conducted and completed the review required of the existing NMPF under <i>section 17 (2)<\/i>, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) where a MSP to replace the existing NMPF has been prepared in accordance with <i>section 17(2)(a)<\/i>.  <\/blockquote><p>I reserve the right to table further amendments on the designation of marine protected areas.  That is another area that should be a factor that results in a delay in the issuing of maritime area consents.<br\/><br\/>My amendment continues that: &quot;(7) The Minister shall exclude from any commencement order <i>section 101 <\/i>for a relevant maritime usage as defined in <i>section 100<\/i>, of the class defined under <i>paragraphs (a)<\/i>and <i>(b)<\/i>&quot; until a proper review is conducted. <br\/><br\/>The context here is that one cannot develop without a maritime area consent, MAC, in many instances.  It is important to understand the Bill allows the Minister to determine the requirement for review up to six years after the publication of the existing NMPF and even then the Minister might determine that there is no action required under section 17(2)(b).  This amendment effectively makes sure that one does not have problematic relevant projects that are just announced and may have been put into the NMPF's spatial plan without making sure that the methodology and the standards being set out in the marine spatial plan, MSP, directive are properly reflected and to ensure that any of the relevant projects that may be set forward or any proposed MACs are consistent with the delivery of sustainable development activity and ensure good environmental status in the marine environment.<br\/><br\/>Last week, the Department told a committee of stakeholders that a review would take place within two years.  Again, if that is the intention then this delay in commencement is not unduly onerous.  It would simply ensure that if the review was done, as is planned and proposed within two years, that we would then be in a position to ensure there is a better quality of consideration in terms of the issuing of MACs.  There may or may not be an upgrade.  We cannot assume what will happen with a review but at least it would leave us in a position to ensure that those might be reflected.<br\/><br\/>I refer to a separate issue that I may bring in at a later stage, that is, increasing knowledge that we have and new research emerging all of the time.  For example, an area of research that has been very significant in recent years is the impacts of seismic and sonar activity in the marine environment.  I am sure that the Minister of State is aware of the Informar research on the automated cetacean acoustics project and the study done by the Maritime Institute of Ireland.  That would allow factors like that to have been considered, be part of the review and be reflected.  There are issues that are not simply affected by actual development and planning but can be affected by maritime use and the kinds of things that might get consents under section 79.  Again, the kinds of MACs under section 79 are the kinds of relevant maritime usages under section 100.<br\/><br\/>I hope the Minister of State will address these concerns.  Perhaps he will recommit to the review and commit to solely delaying these sections of the Act until the review has been conducted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#FF00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>As there are no other speakers, I ask the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#GG00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 seeks to delay the commencement of significant parts of the Bill until such time as the national marine planning framework is reviewed.

It is important that it is given the time that is needed to carry out such a comprehensive review.  This review should not be pressured by a Bill that is waiting to commence.

It simply relates to certain sections of the Bill.  It is a substantial Bill and a huge amount of work needs to be put in place, including entire new bodies that must be constructed and so forth in terms of the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, and others.  It is important to be clear that about two years of work could probably be done on the other sections of the Bill, without commencing.  Section 17 is around the application and granting of maritime area consents, MACs.  A huge amount of work could be done.  This amendment relates to specific sections of the Bill and specific actions of bodies that are being established by the Bill.  A two-year timeframe is being looked at for a review and that is a realistic pause to put on the grants.  The infrastructure and mechanisms around the granting of MACs can be set in place.  We should not then move to the point of granting them and then maybe six months later complete a review which might set out a different set of concerns.  At that point the problem is that MACs would have been granted.<\/p> <p>It is not the commencement of the Bill that is at issue but the commencement of a specific action under the Bill.  Could the Minister address that?  That is the crux of the matter.  We should put in place the infrastructure and all the various aspects over the two-year period, while also conducting a review to ensure we have the best information feeding into those structures and processes that are being set up.  Then we should move towards the issue of the granting of MACs.  To my mind that seems to be sensible.  The cart has been put before the horse a lot in this process.  This maritime planning framework has been brought through at a time when Ireland was meant to have 10% marine protected areas last year and we are due to have 30% nine years from now.  We are behind the curve in that.  This is a good faith attempt to suggest that at least within this part of the process we would try to get the sequencing right so that it is more effective and so that better decisions are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#HH00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Senator.

Amendment No. 3 relates to the accounting of days.  I understand it might not be necessary at this point, insofar as I believe there has been movement on the public consultation.  The amendment is to highlight the phenomenon with which we are all familiar, whereby the Christmas period and periods of bank holidays become the periods in which there are opportunities for engagement.  That has an impact for civil society, for example, for those who may be workers, their allies or their colleagues who can engage in processes.  It even has an impact on the awareness of the opportunities for engagement and consultation.  <\/p><p>This is sometimes a wider issue of public consultation right across government.  We have seen the phenomenon of the Christmas public consultation and the August summer public consultation.  The goal should always be for the best possible public consultation and for real opportunity for engagement.  The goal should not be to get through a public consultation with as little inconvenience from the public as possible by not having engaged, although I know that is not the intention.  I understand there was some positive engagement on the public consultation matter in the D&aacute;il.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 34 is around the arrangements for participation in the review of, preparation for and amendment of a new marine spatial plan, MSP.  Amendment No. 34 provides that the Minister of State might by regulation specify requirements relating to appropriate time periods for public consultation and arrange for the publication of notices related to relevant documents.  These are big documents.  They are significant sets of decisions.  Of course, they are directly related to the Aarhus Convention and the right of every person to participate in environmental decision making.  This amendment suggests areas in which regulations and measures might be put in place in order to ensure that we have the best possible public participation in the development of any new MSP.  It sets out certain particular directives that are important in that process.  I mentioned the Aarhus Convention.  There are also directives on industrial emissions.  That is particularly important now, given that Scopes 1, 2 and 3 and the tracking of corporate and industrial emissions, are becoming particularly important.  I also note integrated pollution prevention and Articles 9 and 10 of the MSP directive.  I believe these principles and policies should be reflected in the public engagement, as well as the opportunities for public engagement, around an MSP.  I hope that the Minister of State might be able to accept amendment No. 34. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MM00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I will comment briefly on amendment No. 3.

There is no doubt that there is huge demand on the public in terms of public consultation.  The dates are one thing, but the method of how we engage with communities and various stakeholders is critically important as well.  We need to move towards participative engagement and away from linear type consultation processes.  Senator Higgins referenced the Aarhus Convention, which is very important in terms of environmental projects and environmental obligations.  The Government has committed to that, in particular around the marine protected areas.  There was significant public engagement, including with fishers and communities.  There has been a good opportunity for engagement on this.  We need to ensure always that there is that sufficient level of engagement.  While this proposal is important in terms of the dates, the method of engagement and how we engage with communities and stakeholders are vitally important too.  I oppose these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MM00600","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister of State's bona fides in respect of amendment No. 3 because I know there has been movement on that.

There should be no battle or difficulty in terms of the administrative burden that is placed on the competent authority versus the public and its participation.  We need to consider how we can make that easier.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has offered to engage with the relevant committee but I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, expand on that and indicate a willingness to engage with interested parties and smaller groups which will not necessarily have a member on that committee but are concerned and passionate about the issue of public participation.

It is a technical amendment to provide that when referencing the marine strategy framework directive we would be clear about what directive is being referenced.  We have done this in regard to other directives.  The amendment is seeking consistency in terms of including a definition and a specific reference.  This is important because this is the directive which provides for the designation of 30% of marine areas as protected by 2030.  It is a crucial directive in this context.  <\/p><p>I hate to press on it, but it is a real concern that we do not have the marine protected areas in place.  The Minister of State will be aware that I am also concerned that other amendments that have been ruled out of order sought that we, at least, put in place interim protections.  This is a crucial period.  In setting out a marine planning framework, which I am aware will be reviewed in two years, we are planning on a framework for the long-term but there is a particular sensitive period, which is the period in which marine protected areas are not yet designated.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is why, although it is ruled out on grounds of cost, there is a requirement or a need for interim protective measures in order to ensure that we do not lose ground, albeit ground beneath the sea.  We know that, especially with biodiversity, sometimes when something is lost, it is lost.  Sometimes it can be recovered but at others it cannot.<\/p><p>We can look to things like migration patterns and so forth.  I am aware the marine planning framework is being reviewed but there were not some of the substantial kinds of scrutiny needed within it.  That is a little wider than the point.  The main point is that amendment No. 4 is it is quite technical.  It is specifically about naming that directive by its EU name in order that it will be clear that we are not talking about some different marine planning framework.  I know that is not the intention; it is just a technical clarification.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 provides that when preparing, amending or revoking guidelines under section 7, the Minister's actions should be consistent with Article 1 of the maritime spatial planning directive, the objectives of the birds directive, the objectives of Article 2 of the habitats directive and the methodologies and the overall requirements of the maritime spatial planning directive, which we have just discussed.  That again is an opportunity because amendment No. 16 gives the Minister scope to be anticipating that there will be 30% marine protected areas.  In that sense it would be very useful to the Minister in his or her preparation of guidelines.  The amendment also covers any programme of measures for the State specified under maritime spatial planning directive.  It also provides that when preparing and developing such guidelines, the Minister shall have regard to the national marine planning framework.  Again, in the development of such guidelines, the Minister can be anticipating aspects that may need to be further reviewed and identifying gaps or issues that brings to light.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 16 further provides that the Minister consult with \"the Minister with any delegated responsibility for natural heritage\".  In this instance, that is the Minister of State.  He will be aware that in either the spring or the autumn of last year, we had a very lengthy discussion about this matter.  An unusual thing has happened whereby as part of our planning infrastructure previously, the Minister with responsibility for housing and planning had particular constraints on him or her.  Those constraints also involved both Ministers to engage with a Minister with responsibility for heritage.  It was a kind of belt-and-braces or checks-and-balances mechanism internal to the Cabinet to ensure that the Minister with responsibility for planning would bring his or her perspective into play, but would also consult the Minister with responsibility for heritage in order to get his or her perspective.<\/p><p>We now have same Minister with responsibility for both areas.  That is why I am suggesting the Minister with responsibility for planning and development would consult with the Minister of State in his or her Department.  That is currently the Minister of State present, who has delegated responsibility for natural heritage.  This comes down to ensuring that even if a checks-and-balances mechanism between Departments is not there, it is still there within a single Department, given the different mandates Minister and Minister of State might have and, indeed, the different perspectives and expertise each might bring.<\/p><p>This also relates to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The amendment also refers to the input and consideration that should be given in the development of guidelines to input from consultation with the public and with public bodies that have been consulted under the guidelines, to include any proposed revocations of those guidelines.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 35 would insert Directive 2008\/56\/EC on the framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy into the Bill.  This is really appropriate and, again, in spirit with what the Minister of State said regarding the importance of engagement.  This directive might not seem to be a direct part of this.  However, it relates to community action in marine environmental policy and is one of the things that the actions of the competent authority should be consistent with.  I am hopeful the Minister of State will actually be able to accept amendment No. 35 because it is very simple and constructive.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 would insert into the Bill the requirement in the maritime spatial planning directive to address marine spatial planning while ensuring good environmental status.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would make the directive something that the actions of the competent authority should be consistent with.  This is also very much consistent with the just transition and climate justice principles and the international conversations that are happening in the context of the sustainable development goals regarding life under water and ensuring that we do not simply have discussions about the regulation of industry and what industry may wish to do with maritime areas.  Rather, we must see the engagement of community and society in respect of marine and environmental matters and recognise that the relationships in this regard are important.  Let us not, for example, focus solely on the economic relationship that certain actors may have with maritime areas because community engagement is also important.  The Minister of State will be aware that this is part of the international conversation in terms of marine planning and marine protection.  It would be a positive signal for Ireland to place the directive within the scope of the matters for consideration.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 42 is similarly based on the framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy.  This is the kind of measure that we know provides ownership, connection and meaning.  It creates a dynamic whereby, in advance, this would be complementary to effective and successful maritime planning, but it is also going to be important down the line for marine protection and for this to be a positive framework that works.  I hope the Minister of State might look to the opportunity presented by the directive and include it in the sections as proposed in amendments Nos. 35, 36, 40 and 42.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#NN00800","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>This was already addressed on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.

Are we saying that it should be left to see whether bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute and the Heritage Council are included?  Under the sections in this Bill, these bodies are not prescribed for the issuing of MARA licences.

Amendment No. 7 aims to include the national heritage plan.  I am conscious that there is a national heritage plan 2030.  The Minister of State waved a copy of it at us at the committee the other day.  It is done and dusted.  There may be a little bit of tweaking.  I think it is an important document.  We do not think enough about marine heritage.  Ours is very rich and we have a rich aquatic life.  There is so much under the sea.  <\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the National Maritime Museum and the work it does.  There is great interest around national heritage and our marine heritage.  It seemed obvious to insert reference to the national heritage plan.<\/p><p>I did a search in the legislation for keywords such as &quot;Aarhus&quot; and &quot;heritage&quot;.  It is interesting how rarely some of these turn up in what is a very substantial document.  I would like to think we can include this.  The Minister of State might ask if we need to be repeating ourselves but we cannot repeat ourselves enough when it comes to our national heritage.  We will have a plan.  I know this is legislation and the Minister of State will not necessarily want to date the legislation but 2030 is a long way out in terms of our heritage plan.  The amendment does not state the national heritage plan 2030 but &quot;the National Heritage Plan&quot;.  I know that the Minister of State thinks a lot about our heritage.  He has been designated with responsibility for heritage.  We should bear in mind how many counties are impacted by maritime activity, even in Kilkenny.  I hope that we can include the amendment. <\/p><p>Amendment No. 8 relates to European Union instruments and directives which are really important.  The integration of coastal zone management and the recommendations on the integrated coastal zone management defines the principles of sound coastal planning and management.  The Minister of State and his officials will be aware of them.  They are EU instruments.  The need for such a tool has come from the realisation that despite increasing deterioration of the natural, social, economic and cultural resources of our European coastal zones, coastal planning activities or planning activities or development decisions still take place in a very sectoral or fragmented way leading to inefficient use of resources, conflicting claims on space and missed opportunities for more sustainable coastal development.  It makes sense.  I think it should be incorporated.  <\/p><p>Sea for Life is another instrument of the EU.  It is a marine strategy framework directive, more commonly known as the marine directive.  It is an encompassing piece of EU legislation specifically aimed at the protection of the marine environment and natural resources and creating a framework for the sustainable use of our marine waters.  The directive involves many implementation challenges, which are addressed through a common implementation strategy between the Commission and the member states and a regional approach to the implementation of its objectives.  These are clear.  Anyone who has done any research on maritime directives, the EU and the instruments will know these are critically important.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#SS00100","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I wish to support amendments Nos. 7 and 8.

Most importantly, what happens in that interim period where we do not have marine protected areas designated but we do have a marine planning framework in place?  My amendment seeks to highlight this question and perhaps the Minister of State could clarify what the interim measures will be.  I am not referring to the cut and thrust of the general processes that will be there in the long term but for this particular period when we have a particular vulnerability, when we have particular areas that are vulnerable now and which should be marine protected areas.  Unless those areas are afforded interim protections in the next two to four crucial years, they could be degraded.  We saw that happen in relation to peatlands and other areas on land.  Where there are no interim protection measures in place, we can almost create an incentive for areas not to be valuable and then they are degraded.  I am interested in interim measures as referenced in amendment No. 9.  I was not prescriptive in that amendment but wanted to give visibility to the question of interim measures.  I seek assurances from the Minister of State in this regard.

The marine planning policy statement is a high-level document that sets out the Government&rsquo;s principles and priorities for maritime planning.  Section 6(5) of the Bill sets out a brief list of the high-level policy framework that will be taken into account when preparing the statement.  However, this list is not exhaustive and any matters that inform this high-level policy document will be considered.  Heritage is one of the many areas that will be considered as part of the preparation of the statement.  Section 6(5) requires that regard is had to the national marine planning framework.  Chapter 7.3 of that framework is dedicated to heritage assets.  Accordingly, since heritage assets are included in the national marine planning framework to which the Minister must have regard when preparing the marine planning policy statement, and section 6(5)(h) of the Bill requires the Minister to have regard to any current policy of the Government relating to maritime planning, which would include the national heritage plan, it is not necessary to make separate provision here for the national heritage plan.  I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments and for consistently raising the issue of heritage in this House.  It is the case that Heritage Ireland 2030 will go to Government shortly after Christmas and this will automatically update as new policy for the period up to 2030.  In that regard, it is not necessary to make a distinctive, separate provision in this legislation for it.<\/p><p>On amendments Nos. 8 and 9, the EU recommendation on integrated coastal zone management is not referenced and therefore, it would not be appropriate to include it here.

The marine strategy framework directive is already included in section 6 of the Bill at section 6(5)(e).  The suite of environmental policies included in the national marine planning framework will afford protection to the marine environment and this would include any interim measures to protect areas of the marine environment as agreed by Government.  As I said earlier, the marine protected areas legislation is in the drafting process at the moment.  We are also considering the huge volume of submissions we had in relation to the expert group report and are confident that we will have a complementary set of objectives around marine protected areas with our marine planning framework.  Environmental protections are already included in the legislation, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>planning applications, environmental impact assessments and so forth.

We are setting a chain of events and a record of words.  Words mean things.  There may be a time when we have to revisit this through an external body.  A European institution may wish to revisit the conversation that we are having here today.  To be clear, the Minister of State is assuring the House and me that these resolutions are not required.

The question is which fits into which.  Will it be the case that marine protected areas will fit into a planning framework?  I do not necessarily take comfort from the fact that there will be consideration of how these things overlap, because I think there needs to be clear prioritisation.  We have talked about different EU directives and legislative obligations, as Senator Boyhan has done.  There is also the core EU precautionary principle, which is what the interim measures idea, of doing no harm, is trying to get at.  It is not really enough to say that we will look at these two matters and how they intersect.  If, for example, a maritime area consent, MAC, is granted for an area and it turns out to be of deep importance to cetaceans and is an area which environmental scientists and others say should be a marine protected area, what happens to the maritime area consent and to planning and development that may have been given the go-ahead in a recognised area?  This is what I mean about the two things intersecting.<\/p> <p>It is also an issue of predictability for business.  The technical document produced by the Climate Change Advisory Council refers to the importance of this legislation, of wind energy, and so on, but it also clearly talks about the importance of things being sited correctly, in the right locations and with clarity about the impact on biodiversity and other matters.  I do not doubt that the two matters are in conversation with each other.  There is no way that they would not be.  There is still a question of which takes precedence.  The interim measures were a chance to create space if that conversation has not already happened, so we are not then talking about accommodating marine protected areas in marine planning legislation that may already have been commenced.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not know whether the Minister of State can answer that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#UU00200","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>In relation to Senator Boyhan's point, I wish to give that commitment.  The Senator is correct.  The national marine planning framework has a dedicated chapter on heritage assets.  The language used is that the Minister must have regard to it when preparing a marine planning policy statement.  Whatever the current policy is, when the policy statement is prepared or whenever Heritage Ireland 2030 is implemented, it must have regard to the national marine planning framework.  I am giving that assurance and I hope it is sufficient for the Senator.<\/p> <p>It is critically important that the Senator raised this issue.  As he said, this is not only natural heritage but cultural heritage.  It is coastal communities which are part of our heritage.  We cannot have a natural heritage without communities being part of that.  We have good conversations with coastal communities in recent months on what they want to achieve out of this.  There are coastal fishers, heritage fishers and many community groups involved in activities in coastal areas that require support and protection as well.  We want to ensure that is included.  It has been outlined well in the high-level report of the marine protected area advisory group led by Professor Tasman Crowe, as I said.  That is very much reflected in the report.<\/p> <p>In response to Senator Higgins, I again give that assurance around the marine protected areas and the marine framework.  The marine protected areas are not a planning tool.  They are features we are seeking to protect.  The marine planning will have to adhere to that once we have the legislative part of it in place because we do not have a definition of marine protected areas in an Irish context.  We want to do it specifically to an Irish context that recognises those coastal communities that we are talking about.  In that regard, we are not saying that activities cannot take place in MPA zones but they may be limited to or have mitigation in place around certain species or features that we are trying to protect in those MPAs, be it the marine birds, corals or other features in the marine environment.<\/p> <p>I give an assurance in that regard that these are interrelated and not separate processes.  The work being done by the marine unit in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is interrelated with the planning side of it and with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We are quite clear.  We have gathered significant data on what we need to try and protect.  As I said, the expert group report gave a large volume of information on how we do this in an Irish context.

Amendment No. 10 is probably the preferential framing but I always try to provide options.  This amendment addresses and corrects section 6, where there is a strange anomaly at the moment.  While there are requirements for the development and approval of a marine planning policy statement, there do not seem to be the same kind of processes and checks and balances around changes to the statement thereafter.  That is inconsistent.  According to this amendment, amendments or revocations of marine planning policy statements would be treated in the same way as the original marine planning policy statement in how they are developed and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It does not make sense to create a back door into the process whereby a marine policy planning statement goes through the process of approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and then a Minister independently makes changes to it thereafter without those kinds of checks and balances.  It is not in the spirit of things and it creates an ambiguity.  Others would question whether the policy statement is an appropriate instrument at all.  Some environmental NGOs have highlighted that question but for now, if there is a policy statement, at the very minimum it should be subject to proper scrutiny, in whatever form that ends up.<\/p><p>I welcome that the Minister of State has responded previously to some concerns around the Bill as initiated as regards amendments or revocations.

I am sure the Minister of State and all of us know the importance of a local planning office.  It is a reference point for communities in terms of planning.  It is where many planning issues are co-ordinated and put on public display.  Other Government agencies and Departments use a local planning office as a hub for information on planning issues.  That is right.  I always try to bring everything back to local and community matters.  They are the natural planning authorities in the 31 local authority areas and, therefore, it is not too much to stipulate &quot;and available for inspection at a local authority planning office&quot;.<\/p><p>The second part of my amendment reads: &quot;(c) inviting members of the public and prescribed bodies as follows: a local, regional or planning authority, the Commissioners of Public Works (OPW)&quot;.  The Minister of State will know what prescribed bodies means.  It was important that I included the OPW in the list because we underestimate the work of the OPW in terms of maritime development.  For many years I was a director of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and we had a very close working arrangement with the OPW.  Indeed, the Office of Public Works ran and administered the harbour very successfully for many years.  <\/p><p>My amendment continues: <\/p> <blockquote> \t..and a body referred to in Article 28 or 137 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (as amended), to make representations in writing thereon to the Minister, not later than six weeks after the date of publication of the notice in the newspaper (or, if the notice is published in more than one such newspaper, the last date of publication), at an address (which may be an electronic address) specified in the notice. <\/blockquote> <p>There has been much talk about engagement and I know the Minister of State is committed to that.  It is important that we have public participation, which has been echoed by everything he has said about heritage and planning.  That is right and we, as a House, are committed to that.

I agree with everything Senator Boyhan said with the slight exception that I do not believe six weeks is adequate and I do not believe the four weeks that is currently stipulated in the Bill is adequate.  Let us bear in mind that a marine planning policy statement, MPPS, as the Minister of State said, has high-level principles.  It is quite wide-ranging and has significant implications.  There may well be a requirement for a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and certainly an appropriate assessment, I would imagine, of the implications, any significant changes or significant matters in an MPPS.  The four-week timeframe that we might apply to a building is just not appropriate for something so significant and it creates an inequality of arms for the public.<\/p> <p>Again, people say everybody is able to go in through these public processes.  They are there and it is important that everybody is able to go in.  It is part of the public's democratic right.  Also, that is why prescribed bodies and their expertise are important.  It should not be that this is only available to those who can afford to do so.  We know that companies may have a large number of full-time staff and be very well resourced.  These for-profit organisations will be in a position to produce and turn things around very quickly.

If, for example, we have coastal communities that are trying to work together or respond to something significant, it would allow for better decision-making and engagement by those communities, which would then engage with the process.  If the Minister of State accepts Senator Boyhan's amendment, which involves a six-week period, I will bow to that because there is so much else that is good in his amendment.  However, I urge the Minister of State to consider the fact that a period four weeks is deeply inadequate in the context of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#YY00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I hear what Senator Higgins is saying.  Clearly, four weeks is not enough.  I have to remind Senators and the Minister of State of something, and it is not because he is a member of the Green Party.  I know many of his colleagues and his party's counsellors and I am aware that they became politicised through their advocacy for planning, environmental and community issues.  They were to the fore on that.  There are six or seven of the Minister of State's party colleagues on my local county council.  That is testimony to their work, commitment and advocacy on the environment, especially the marine environment.  All of them had track records in community and environmental advocacy initiatives before they were ever elected to the council.  It followed that they then got elected, which is a fantastic achievement and I have been talking to some of them.<\/p> <p>While a period of four weeks is proposed in the Bill, I am suggesting a moderate increase of two weeks in order to make it six.  Four weeks is very tight and I am suggesting six.   It would be fantastic to have a 16-week period but that will not happen; it is an increase of 12 more than I had am suggesting.  It would be unreasonable if a modest increase from four weeks to six weeks was not facilitated.  I know that it is the end of the year, that the Minister of State is completing the cycle of this Bill and that he does not want to go back into the D&aacute;il and bring in changes but that should not limit the scope for getting this right.

Senator Boyhan and I have spoken on a number of occasions in this Chamber about the importance of good, robust public engagement and how that brings about better outcomes for all parties.  That is something we agree on.  However, I consider that much of what is proposed in these amendments would be more appropriately addressed in secondary legislation.  When the Bill is passed, my Department will commence the preparation of regulations, which will include further detail on public consultation.  This will also include identifying prescribed bodies for specific functions of maritime planning.  This is similar to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, which support the 2000 Act and set out the detail for prescribed bodies and timeframes.<\/p> <p>I would again take the opportunity to highlight that the Department, throughout the process of developing the current marine planning policy statement and the NMPF, has consistently engaged early and often with all bodies which have a role to play, including the environmental NGOs that are hugely significant and important to us, relevant public sector bodies, and many more.  This is the correct way to develop policy rather than by means of the top-down approach of old.  The proposal to increase the public consultation period for the marine planning policy statement from four weeks to 16 weeks is considered excessive.  We have a continued and significant engagement with all parties as well as the mechanism of online engagement.

Public authorities and State agencies should enable the public to comment in a reasonable time, for example, on proposals and projects affecting the environment or plans or programmes relating to the environment by the Government.  The outcome of the public participation process should be taken into consideration in all decision-making.  This is the backbone of the Aarhus Convention that is so much talked about.<\/p> <p>When we come to actually putting in the votes and legislation to support that, however, we seem to back off.  Everyone is talking about the Aarhus Convention and decision-making and engagement but somehow it does not go further in terms of the legislation.  It is important, therefore, as the Minister of State rightly said, that a public participation process should take into consideration the decision-making process.  We need to facilitate information to be made freely accessible and available to members of the public particularly but also the NGOs, environmental networks and all the other prescribed environmental bodies with which the Minister of State will be very familiar, and which have high hopes for Government and particularly for him and the Minister responsible for driving this legislation through.  There is a great expectation that we here would stand in solidarity with people.  It is important, therefore, that we have participation in the decision-making process.  People need a reasonable amount of time, however, which is what we are talking about here.  As the Minister of State knows, the four-week period is only part of this amendment.  It is a very important amendment.  I believe it will potentially be the subject of litigation and will possibly be referred further afield for some determination and argument.  I think it right that we have on the record where people stand regarding this key amendment because it is an important one.<\/p> <p>I take it from the Minister of State's summary that he is suggesting, and I am open to correction so correct me if I am wrong, that he would see a possible situation that there might be secondary legislation for NGOs and other organisations affected, and in the secondary legislation, the Department and his officials might be mindful of a possible six-week period.  I am only saying six weeks because I suggested that.  It may be longer; I do not know.  I need some reassurances on that, however.  Is it being suggested that it would be in secondary legislation?  If that is the case, is the Minister of State committed?  The Green Party is in government.  As I keep saying, it is an important aspect of Government.  That is one of the key issues.  Green Party members are unashamedly environmentalists and are very proactive.  The Minister of State personally and his party are very proactive with regard to the Aarhus Convention so we want to send a message clearly here.  Am I right in saying the Minister of State is in favour of extending the four-week period possibly out to six weeks and perhaps even more?  Is that the direction the Minister of State feels he would like to go?  Would he be absolutely committed to driving that in terms of his own agenda within the Department?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#AAA00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The fact, which has been very well articulated, is that the Aarhus Convention requires that there be appropriate time to the scale of the decision and, again, this is not a small environmental decision in terms of marine planning policies.

The Minister of State may not wish to embrace my 16 weeks but I certainly suggest that a further amount would be considered.  I urge the Minister of State to consider that.<\/p> <p>As I said, we know Ireland is often reviewed under the Aarhus Convention as falling a little bit short and it has been challenged on that matter.

Those are the process that will come next.  We are not talking about how this legislation was arrived at but about what happens on an ongoing basis.  Some relevant organisations were not mentioned as prescribed bodies, as we discussed earlier.  I do not see where those organisations will be included.  Perhaps there will be supplemental legislation and statutory instruments in which those bodies will be named.  However, I do not know if those bodies will be anywhere near any of the rooms where anything is being decided.<\/p><p>As Senator Cummins articulately put it, all of these organisations which have a key voice and are key environmental actors are not a substitute for the public.  Each individual member of the public should have a say.  That includes somebody who may never have thought about marine planning but who knows a section of coast and has a view on a particular species, who cares about birds, for example, or some other specific aspect of biodiversity and knows that the place of such a species might be affected by a shift or change in its circumstances or by a particular marine planning policy statement.  Such people may have an important input.  They may wish to talk to their neighbours.  They may then wish to gather.  It will not only be organisations that already exist that will wish to have an input, although the input of such organisations is important because they comprise a depth of expertise.  It is also important that each individual has adequate time to engage with the process on an equal footing.<\/p><p>I know the Minister of State has referred to that idea and I am sure he is committed to it.  However, the timeframe does not allow for it.  Four weeks is too little.  It is hard enough to submit an opinion about a specific building within four weeks.  Four weeks to engage around an entire marine planning policy is a very tight window of time.  If the Minister of State will not accept our amendments, I encourage him to consider coming back to us on Report Stage with an adjustment to that time period.  I do not know whether he can be flexible when a period of four weeks is written in the legislation.  I do not know what can be done about that.  However, if there is any scope for the Minister of State to extend or supplement that period within other aspects of the legislation, even through pre-consultation or other means, I encourage him to do so.

As a former councillor, Senator Cummins knows about public participation.  He advocates it strongly when we discuss county development plans, local government, regional government and national government.  I have no doubt everyone here understand the importance of public participation.  We would not be successful politicians if we did not engage and advocate strongly with our electorate regarding public participation in decision making.  For this reason, I do not know what the big problem is.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 12 proposes to include a new paragraph (b): \"stating that a copy of the proposed statement, amendment or revocation may be inspected on a website of the Government, and available for inspection at a local authority planning office\".  Surely the Minister of State does not have a problem with that.  Is he, a Minister in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, going to tell me there is a problem with that?  Let me break it down and simplify it.  All that is being requested in paragraph (b) is that copies be available for inspection at the statutory local planning offices which have planning hubs and a mechanism to facilitate the public display of proposals.  I want to hear the Minister of State tell me if he is against that.<\/p> <p>The amendment also proposes to include a new paragraph (c) providing for the invitation of \"members of the public and prescribed bodies as follows: a local, regional or planning authority.\"  Those are arms of the State.  Paragraph (c) also provides for the invitation of the Office of Public Works.  We have a designated Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW.  I am surprised.  I would say the Minister of State would be shocked if he thought we were excluding the OPW.  Paragraph (c) further provides for the invitation of a body referred to in the prescribed bodies and for a period of six weeks for the making of representations.  The Bill, as drafted, provides for four weeks but I propose it be six weeks.  An additional two weeks is not a long time.<\/p> <p>I would like to think we could put this Bill to bed today rather than defer it.  However, I am happy to come to the House on Friday and tease this matter out further.  Let me break the amendment down into three simple asks.  It is about the local authorities, the Office of Public Works and moving the time allowed for the making of representations from four to six weeks.  Taking each segment of that, will the Minister of State tell us with what aspect of that proposal does he have a difficulty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#CCC00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I call Senator Cummins from the great coastal town of Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#CCC00500","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Senator Boyhan is far more experienced at legislation than I am but he also knows that when amendments must be taken in their entirety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#CCC00600","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#CCC00700","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":185,"content":"<p>He cannot take little bits of it to suit the agenda of the day.

It is our view that this could be addressed by secondary legislation via regulations.  That is what we are saying.  We will commence the preparation of regulations which will include, as I stated in the opening statement on this particular amendment, detail on public consultation.  What is in the legislation is there as a minimum.  It is not limited to that.  I am giving assurance to the Members present this afternoon that within the regulations, details on further public consultation can be clarified and teased out in relation to some of the points raised by Senators Boyhan and Higgins.<\/p> <p>We have had significant challenges around public consultation over the last 18 months.  We all accept that, particularly in and around Covid-19.  That is not to say, however, that public bodies have not responded positively.  These include Departments across Government.  First, the Government was formed during Covid-19.  Many public consultations have taken place online and in other spaces.  Our city and county development plans have largely been led through online portals.  They have led to huge engagement from members of the public in prescribed time periods.  We should take the lessons from that.  Many members of the public and the organisations that have been part of those processes have found them useful.  There is much to be gained from that, not just from time periods for engagement, but from how we engage.  That is critically important here.  It is important that we move away - as Senator Boyhan and I have discussed on a number of occasions - from linear consultation to more participative and inclusive methodologies, whether at local level, or in high-level legislative items or policy, such as the marine planning policy statement that we are talking about here this afternoon.  I want to give that assurance to the Senators.<\/p> <p>I know that Senator Boyhan will press this amendment.  However, again, we consider that the detail on public consultation should be included around the drafting of regulations.  The Aarhus Convention has been mentioned on a number of occasions here.  It is significant and important from the point of view of people's engagement, communities&rsquo; engagement, access to environmental information and access to environmental justice.

I do not really understand why these factors are not reflected in the objectives of marine spatial plans.  I propose to insert that a key goal of our marine spatial plans is \"to contribute to the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment, including resilience to climate change impacts,&rdquo;.  That should be there already.  It is important that when we talk about maritime spatial plans we name and centre the preservation, protection and improvement of the environment as something that needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>We talk about achieving ecological, economic and social priorities.  We can use a very extractive and utilitarian approach in relation to our strategic planning.  Sometimes it is not about usages or taking and using but about protecting, preserving, supporting and creating resilience.  I recognise that the ecosystem-based approach is there \"for the purpose of supporting proper planning and sustainable maritime usages in the maritime area\" but it is all about use and what nature will do for us and how we can get it to deliver for us.  <\/p><p>I recall the Conference of the Parties in Madrid, the one before Glasgow, which was more disappointing than Glasgow in some ways.  There was an idea that nature must almost have to audition for everything: should we consider preserving a bit of seaweed?  Only if we can designate exactly its use and purpose.  Even whales were considered in terms of how much carbon one can store in one.  Our spatial plans would benefit and would be more complementary to the marine protection regime we hope to put in place if we made it clear that our marine spatial plan is thinking about the marine space.  I reserve the right to bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  There are strategic development goals on life under water.  There are things that are just good and important that we should plan for and protect that are not necessarily usages.  Perhaps it is a philosophical point but it is important.  Our relationship with nature affects how we plan for nature.  Therefore, I hope the Minister of State will consider amendment No. 22.  I will not move amendment No. 23.  <\/p><p>On amendment No. 24, I recognise that these are issues that were already debated at length in the D&aacute;il.  This is about trying to ensure that the MSP directive would be more centred in the process and that we would make visible the considerations around the MSP directive.  They are in the background but it might be advisable and useful for the State to make it clear in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#JJJ01400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I am speaking to amendments Nos. 22 and 24, since the Senator withdrew No. 23.

This is contrary to the directive.  Article 3 of the MSP directive defines maritime spatial planning as &ldquo;a process by which the relevant Member State&rsquo;s authorities analyse and organise human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological, economic and social objectives&rdquo;.  The Senator referred to that.  Article 5 requires member states to consider economic, social and environmental aspects to support sustainable development and growth in the maritime sector.  The preservation, protection and improvement of the marine environment, although hugely significant, is not the only objective to be pursued.  The Bill has been crafted to ensure that it transposes the directive consistently recognising the need to achieve ecological, economic and social priorities.  I would invite the Senator to read through the NMPF and she will see that the first section is dedicated to ocean health.

The points were well made by the Senator in relation to COP25 and while there were significant disappointments with regard to COP26, there were also significant gains, particularly with regard to the marine area.  The Irish Government participated virtually in COP15 on biodiversity in Kunming in China.  We will be participating again next year with a suite of policies and our objectives around the marine area and marine protection will ensure that we have the high-level ambition that we consistently speak about.  The complementarity to which the Senator refers will be embedded in all of the work we do and within that, the adherence to the sustainable development goals is something of which we are critically aware.  In particular, we are focused on sustainable development goal No.17 which refers to the partnerships for the goals, which is what we have achieved in our discussions and deliberations here this afternoon.  We are very clear that this is a partnership approach, with Government leading on policy but also working with the State and semi-State sector, industry and NGOs to ensure that we have a thriving blue economy and thriving nature and biodiversity protection in our marine space.  This is something of which we are consistently mindful in this legislation and in the work we are doing on marine protection.  I am really delighted that the Senator has raised it here this afternoon.  <\/p><p>Specifically with regard to amendment No. 24, I am confident that the wording of Article 16(5) adequately addressed the requirements of the directive.  I remind the Members that the directive states that while it is appropriate for the European Union to provide a framework for maritime spatial planning, member states remain responsible and competent for designing and determining the format and content of such plans.  Any marine spatial plans or designated maritime area plans must meet the requirements of the national marine planning framework and in so doing the requirements of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive.  While I appreciate the spirit of these amendments, I am confident that all of these aspects have already been covered in the Bill and, therefore, I am opposing these two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#KKK00200","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Again, I would note the subtle difference between maritime activities and maritime usages.

Six years is too far away for a review.  The Minister of State indicated, and maybe he will confirm, that his intention is to have a review within two years.  This amendment is saying that, ideally, it should be sooner than two years and it should be as soon as possible.  This is the precautionary principle and the idea that while a full review should ideally be commenced and carried out within the immediate period, there are a couple of key areas of high concern which should be reviewed, even pending a fuller review.  One is compliance with the maritime spatial planning directive.  We have quoted that directive back and forth to each other.  The Minister of State can hear the real concern about the detail of that directive and how that is reflected in these processes.  It is not enough for it to be there in the background.  It is a matter of making sure that the processes under our national marine planning framework are fit for purpose and fully compliant with the marine spatial planning directive.  I have made my case about interim protections.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has expressed positive sentiments that agree with me about many matters but I have not really had assurance about what happens in the meantime.  New research has recently discovered new coral reef areas and shark habitats.  How do we protect them and ensure that nothing happens to them, pending a proper review or marine protected areas being designated?  The projects under the current national marine planning framework need to be consistent with the marine spatial planning directive.  This is all in the context of the delayed implementation of marine protected areas.  I should point out that marine protected areas are not the only thing that we are waiting on.  There is also the question of sites designated under the birds and habitats directives.  Moving from sea to land, there are many areas designated as special areas of conservation.  I urge the Minister of State, who has the power to designate special areas of conservation, to move more rapidly on this if it is to happen within the term of this Government.  All of these processes are in play.  This is a set of urgent reviews to make sure that we do no harm in the interim.<\/p> <p>What was the grouping?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MMM00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 26 to 29, inclusive, are grouped together..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MMM00500","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I am not going to move amendments Nos. 27 or 28.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MMM00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":241,"content":"<p>We will come back to that in a moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MMM00700","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>They are grouped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MMM00800","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I want to give the Minister of State a chance to reply, then we will come back to Senator Higgins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#MMM00900","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 26 proposes that a review of the national marine planning framework be commenced within one year of enactment of this legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These proposed amendments contain deficiencies.  These include providing for particular pillars of sustainable development and sectors to the exclusion of others, and thus upsetting the neutrality of the legislation, requiring compliance with very specific and selected provisions of directives other than the MSP directive - some of which are already covered elsewhere in the Bill, such as the birds and habitats directives, as referenced by the Senator - and other matters outside of the requirements of the MSP directive, which this Bill is giving effect to.<\/p><p>It appears that the intention is to up-end a plan that has only been adopted and is not properly embedded.  This simply is not acceptable to the Government.  I understand that the Senator is not happy with the NMPF but it is Ireland's national marine plan, the first of a series of interconnected and related spatial plans for the maritime area.  We will simply not go back four years to the beginning of the process, holding off progress on all aspects of the NMPF.  This Government takes marine management seriously and we take decarbonisation seriously.  We need to move forward with this Bill.<\/p><p>The requirement in the Bill is that the review will be carried out within six years but it is our intention that we will carry out this review sooner, particularly for the first national maritime spatial plan.  Now we must focus our resources on getting the new system up and running.  I am happy that the existing NMPF underpins this system appropriately in its current form.<\/p><p>In terms of the detail of the proposed amendment, it has the effect that no maritime area consents or development consents can be granted pending the conclusion of the aforementioned review.  This would simply have the effect of rendering significant parts of the Bill inoperable for a period of time.<\/p><p>This proposal, in itself, is extremely concerning as it would also mean that where one is currently permitted to obtain planning permission on the foreshore under Part 15 of the Planning Act, this right would effectively be removed.  Just to be clear, under this amendment, no harbours could be expanded, no boathouses constructed, or no recreational jetties or pontoons erected pending a review of a national plan that would only be six months old.<\/p><p>As to the bodies that should be consulted during the proposed review, many of these bodies were already central to the production of the NMPF and sat on the marine advisory group for the four-year period in which the plan was being prepared.  The NMPF has, I should note for the record, been broadly and widely welcomed by the members of the advisory group and further afield.<\/p><p>I appreciate the Senators' intention to ensure participation of certain organisations.  This is why public participation, including the input of relevant organisations, is stitched into the very formulation of maritime spatial plans, ensuring that relevant views are taken into account throughout the entire process.<\/p><p>As regards specific points raised by Senator Warfield but particularly by Senator Higgins, they referenced the habitats and birds directives and the Wildlife (Amendment) Act.  Some of those will be brought forward again early next year.  There are also mechanisms by which certain species can be afforded protection under the Wildlife Act and those can be given consideration.  We are certainly of the view that these processes are fully compliant with the NMPF directive.

I know there are imperfections in the wording of amendment No. 30 but I think the principle is really important, namely, that there would be a process to provide for interim protections.  This is all about what happens in between.  Simply stating that we are happy with this process and will be happy with the next process regarding the marine protected areas is fine but the space is that space in between.  While I understand the Minister of State's personal interest in and engagement in all of these areas, I am still not satisfied as to what the interim measures may be.  Perhaps it is not a pause, as some of our amendments have looked to, that is, that there would be a pause pending the proper things being put in place.  Certainly there should be interim protections to ensure that the designation the Minister of State hopes to do in terms of marine protected areas is not compromised.  I will be really frank and this is not so much on the Minister but rather everybody who has had a role in this area.  The delays in designating special areas of conservation in Ireland have led to areas becoming degraded and damaged.  In respect of the delays in marine protection area designation and the failure to achieve the very basic 10% we were meant to achieve last year, we lose ground, space and opportunities.  Biodiversity loss can be significant.  The kind of things that may be allowed for under the marine planning framework have real impacts.  I reserve the right to introduce an amendment on this issue on Report Stage.  I will certainly engage with the Minister of State regarding the regulations on this.  It involves things like the kind of surveys done regarding maritime usages and the kind of activities around even applications for maritime usages.  All kinds of things may happen.<\/p> <p>Again, what I am trying to suggest here is that the Minister of State should put interim measures in place to ensure that the position our maritime areas are in at the point when our marine protected areas are introduced does not in any way deteriorate between this moment and when that legislation comes in.  This is where the interim protections come in.  Maritime area consents, which, again, allow for different maritime usages, have the potential to compromise biodiversity.  Even the very act of the surveys associated with maritime usages have had a knock-on effect.  We know of multiple companies conducting annual surveys again and again.  The survey on cetacean audio impacts has been quite significant in that regard.  It is a similar case with development consents because if we issue them, there is that concern.  I know this is not perfectly worded but if we have that situation, it is very hard to roll back on something.  There is a reluctance to do that.  We saw it even with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill.  Frankly, it is ludicrous that we are prohibiting certain kinds of things in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill but then say, \"If you've already had an exploration, we should allow you to potentially go on and apply for an extraction licence.\"  There are knock-on effects.

Both will need to be provided for in the Irish Statute Book.  We know that and we are acting on same.<\/p> <p>On marine protected areas, the progress to deliver the commitments contained in the programme for Government has been significant and encouraging.  Following on from the independent expert advisory group, which was led by Professor Crowe, a report was published in January of this year.  In tandem with the review and analysis of the huge amount of submissions that were received through the subsequent public consultation process from February to July, we have now commenced work on developing a general scheme for the new marine protected area legislation.  The development of this legislation is expected to continue into 2022.  Officials from my Department provided a progress update on marine protected areas to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage at the end of November.  I urge Senators to read the transcript of that contribution because it gives significant reassurances concerning the common thread that we have spoken about here this afternoon.  I refer to the interrelatedness of these policies, Bills and legislation.<\/p> <p>The substance of the amendment is about the protection of the marine environment.  It requires that nothing happens in the maritime area until such time as interim measures are put in place to protect these potential MPAs.  First, I am not sure that the Senators fully appreciate the impact of this amendment on local coastal communities.   I have said previously that this Bill is for all maritime users.  This amendment would have significant and severe consequences on local fisheries, ports, harbours, tourist facilities, local boat clubs and persons who privately own parts of the current foreshore.  None of these could be expanded, amended or improved until the work referred to in this amendment was completed.  Existing rights under Part 15 of the Planning Act could be lost.  Where is the justification for this severe action?  Where is the timeline for these measures?  How will the public know when they can start to interact with their maritime area again?  There is an overreach here that impacts all maritime users, the net has been cast too widely in our view and please excuse the pun.<\/p> <p>Second, there is no definition of exactly what these interim measures are or how they would interact with the relevant provisions in either the MAC assessment criteria, or the criteria that coastal planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to when assessing planning applications.  There is no indication as to how they would relate to the maritime licensing system being proposed, which is separate from both the MAC and planning parts.  This is extremely important from a legislative point of view.  How would it work?  It appears that there are no express obligations to have regard to these so-called interim measures in decision making and no further thought put into their operation.<\/p> <p>Third, the amendment presumes that there are currently no environmental protections in the maritime area and this is not the case.  Not only are there existing designated European sites, the NMPF, which is a live and implemented plan, contains a suite of environmental policies to ensure that applicants and decision makers alike clearly demonstrate in a detailed and objective way how proposals can co-exist with the marine environment.  I would draw the Senators' attention, in particular, to Chapter 5 of the NMPF in this respect.  We have said continuously that any application in the maritime area will be subject to rigorous environmental assessments commensurate with the nature and scale of what is being proposed and where it is being proposed.  This can and will be added to through the designated maritime area plan process in a new and innovative way.  Indeed, I have previously committed to looking at how this can be done.  The DMAPs will form part of the decision-making policy framework as legislated for but we need an operable Act in order to do that.<\/p> <p>I will not accept an amendment that not only affects so many maritime users without any indication as to when they might be allowed to resume their plans for their local coastal communities, but also runs contrary to other work that my officials are currently undertaking to implement the marine strategy framework directive.  I oppose the amendment.  Again, I urge Senators to read the transcript of the meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee that took place in November.  I urge Senators to read the contributions made by our marine environmental unit.  Significant assurance was given in that regard in terms of marine protection and how all of these plans are interrelated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#QQQ00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>It is a bit disingenuous to state that we do not have specifics.  We provided many detailed specifics in amendment No. 2, which related to interim protections.  That amendment was ruled out of order because our dictating such matters to the Minister would constitute a charge on the State.  We suggested a timeline of two months for beginning the review.  The matter of how long such a review would last would have been the prerogative of the Minister.  The Minister could state that it would be a six-month process if he or she so wished and he or she could give that certainty to coastal communities and others.  While we outlined in amendment No. 2 what we considered might be the kind of interim measures that need to be considered, in amendment No. 30 we leave scope in that regard to the Minister and we are not overly prescriptive.<\/p> <p>The big issue is the gap in interim measures.  The Minister of State talked about the considerations.  I will look back at what the marine environmental unit is saying between now and Report Stage, but I would like to see interim measures that do not just relate to the general process and system that are in place.  Some things can be improved and given a fresh start and then they can be changed again.  Protection, by its nature, needs to be done each minute, week, month or year in the interim period.  I understand the considerations that will be feeding into the processes, but this amendment is loosely worded in order to give the Minister scope to put in place a plan for interim measures.  It is designed to allow the Minister to set something out and not to simply say that we should trust the officials and their goodwill and intentions, the processes and so forth.  The Minister of State should give us, as parliamentarians, an assurance that as we let this legislation through, there is a plan for interim measures.  I would much prefer it if the Minister of State was bringing forward an amendment - maybe he will do so on Report Stage - indicating clearly that he recognises that this law is landing at a certain time when certain important decisions have not yet been made and that he understands that there is an interim period when particularly sensitivity might need to be applied, including the precautionary principle and so forth.  That is where the gap lies.<\/p> <p>We have a detailed proposal in amendment No. 2, which, unfortunately, cannot be debated, and we have a very loose proposal in amendment No. 30.  The latter includes a proposal to give the timetable over to the Minister such that the process would commence in two months, would last for as long as the Minister would consider to be necessary and would involve such interim measures as the Minister might deem to be necessary.  I agree that it is looser than we might like but it was seeking to strengthen the hands of the Minister, as well as seeking to strengthen our understanding and confidence as we vote for this legislation.  If we are to vote for the Bill, we should know that the position regarding interim measures will be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#RRR00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for the general thrust of what they are trying to achieve in the amendment.

It is not simply a case of defining a boundary and specifying what activity will take place in this zone.  In its development, the management plan for the area must take into account all activities that currently use that area or could potentially use that area in the future.  It must also take into account environmental aspects of the area.  All data generated in this development will be collected under the ethos of collate once, reuse many times, and will be added to the maritime database as set down previously in the Bill.  This is a considerable shift in how we protect an area, a tailored product that puts the environment at the heart of the management plan.  Furthermore, all DMAPs will have to undergo screening for strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 39 effectively seeks to apply the requirements of the national maritime spatial plan to what is the comprehensive subnational planning process, namely, DMAPs.  It would, in my view, upset and interfere with the intention of the DMAP concept.<\/p> <p>In accordance with section 20 of the Bill, DMAPs may be prepared in respect of specified activities for one or more than one designated geographical or sectoral area or for both.  The procedures set out in the Bill are sufficiently flexible to enable the development of regional, local or sectoral plans by a designated competent authority subject to the oversight of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Oireachtas approval.  DMAPs will be prepared in the context of the existing national marine planning framework and are required to specify the objectives of the national marine planning framework that it seeks to attain.<\/p> <p>The DMAP concept differs from the national maritime spatial plan, which provides an overall framework for the entire maritime area, incorporating ecological, economic and social priorities.  The national marine planning framework provides a holistic, overarching policy position in relation to the maritime spatial plan in Ireland and is the State&rsquo;s primary response to commitments under the maritime spatial planning directive.  DMAPs should not duplicate this but operate within the general framework and enhance it by responding to more specific maritime planning needs, be they sectoral or localised.  It is, therefore, not appropriate to apply all of the requirements of a national marine plan to a sectoral or geographically specific plan as to do so would undermine the purpose and functionality of a DMAP.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, in accordance with section 21(4), it is the Minister's responsibility in reviewing a DMAP proposal to consider whether it satisfies requirements of the MSP directive and, again, when reviewing the draft DMAP.<\/p><p>In effect, the overarching objective of this amendment to comply with certain provisions is provided for by reference to the NMPF in sections 21, 22 and 28 and the MSP directive in sections 20, 23, 24 and 28.

It states that the Minister is notifying the competent authority of the inconsistency but that the draft DMAP does not need to be amended to avoid or even mitigate the inconsistency.What is the point in telling us that section 24 has all these checks with which DMAPS will line up if there is a straightforward get-out clause where the Minister will say to a competent authority that an inconsistency can effectively be disregarded and that not only do measures not need to be in place to avoid it but that it does not even have to put in measures to try to mitigate the inconsistency?

It applies in general to State boards, but to the specific exclusion of members of local authorities from serving as members of State boards.  This makes perfect sense in the case of Members of the Oireachtas who have been involved in the legislative process in the setting up of this body and so on, but I do not see any reason a member of a local authority should be excluded from consideration to be a member of this authority.  This also relates to consideration of such members for the role of chief executive of MARA.  <\/p><p>I am not saying that just because somebody is a member of a local authority he or she would be automatically appointed.  I certainly do not believe it should be the case that a councillor would be allowed to ask a Minister to appoint him or her to a board.  If at some stage in the future we have a councillor who is an eminent marine biologist, a specialist in the engineering of wind turbines or who has an intricate knowledge of marine matters I do not believe he or she should be excluded from being allowed to sit on the board of MARA on the basis that he or she is a councillor.  <\/p><p>I am asking that the relevant provision around local authority membership would be removed from this legislation.  I note in particular that even though local authority members are being excluded, the legislation provides for a representative of the City and County Management Association.  This does not make sense.  The argument that may be made is that local authorities have some involvement in the early stages of the planning process.  It would be extremely peripheral if there is, but we are excluding councillors on that ground while allowing for a chief executive of a local authority to be appointed.  The language used within the legislation is &quot;representative&quot; rather than &quot;nominee&quot;, which is also of concern.  It is not making sense to me.  <\/p><p>I will give an example with regard to Wexford County Council, with which I am familiar.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Let us say we had elected somebody with an extensive knowledge of the marine as a councillor.  That is perfectly possible in some of our coastal communities in say, Kilmore Quay or up in Courtown or wherever.  He or she is qualified to be a member of this authority on all other grounds but because he or she decided to serve his or her local community by being elected to a local authority, he or she is automatically ruled out of consideration.  Despite this, the chief executive of Wexford County Council, who, arguably, might have far greater say in the planning process in any licensing or foreshore issues that emerge could be considered for appointment.  Frankly, I do not think that is fair.<\/p><p>By the way, I do not have a problem with a chief executive being there but it is completely unfair to exclude members of local authorities simply because they are serving.  The request here is not about the Minister being allowed to appoint any member of a local authority.  The individual concerned should be qualified.  This must apply to all State boards.  A habit has developed in recent years where we exclude local authority members from everything.  As the Minister of State will know from his other role with the electoral commission legislation, we are trying to get some of the best people into local government.  We are trying to encourage them.  We should also be trying to encourage the best people onto State boards but we should not be forcing extremely qualified and skilled people to have to choose between the two.<\/p><p>I raised this the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on Second Stage and privately.  He said the case I was making was interesting and compelling.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response.

Rather than the bigger question of city and county councillors and other boards, I wish to stick with this particular issue.  We are dealing with the board of MARA here.  Let us be clear that MARA will not be granting planning permissions directly.  It is ultimately the board.  We need to be clear because there was a case made by some officials when I discussed this with the Minister.  He said there was always that potential conflict and mentioned the planning tribunals and the distance between the elected members and planning decisions.  However, while MARA will be granting licences, it will not be granting planning permissions.  That is an important point.  I served two terms on the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  There were four councillors nominated to it from the local authority from all parties and we did an exceptionally good job.  I am familiar with Galway, Waterford, Wexford, Drogheda and all the ports around the country.  We all know councillors play a meaningful role.  They are elected but they also have their finger on the pulse.  They understand the community.  They understand the connection it has with the sea, be that to do with leisure and recreation, the new dimension and dynamic added to the coast with the 5 km, which will be falling back into the planning authorities and the challenges with renewables, as well as all the potential they bring.  It is going to be an enormous thing.  Elected city and county councillors have skill and local knowledge and they represent people.  We talk about bringing people with us and councillors are elected by the people and they should have a meaningful role in this.<\/p> <p>Ultimately however, this legislation was passed in the D&aacute;il and I cannot see the Minister of State coming in here and changing it and then going back to the D&aacute;il tomorrow or the day after.  Here we are now with Government Senators suggesting we amend it.  It is an interesting dynamic and an interesting debate.  I am absolutely supportive of it.

Senator Boyhan mentioned the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company on which he served a number of terms on the board.  When I first became a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in 2009 I was selected by the council at that time to be a member of the harbour board, but before I had a chance to take up the position these Houses changed the law to remove the involvement of local councillors in harbour boards, so I never got a chance to take the seat.  That happened just a month after I was elected.<\/p> <p>The experience we had in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is that thereafter &ndash; I cannot speak to a great extent of what happened before that &ndash; the members of the local authority, and by extension the population of the local authority area, were excluded from the management of the harbour company.  The Minister of State will be aware of what an important asset D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour is for the local community and for Dublin as a whole.  It is an area of enormous historic and heritage importance.  During my 11 years on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I saw an enormous decline in the management, maintenance and use of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour.  Part of that is linked very closely to the departure of the ferry service to Holyhead, which cut off a revenue stream, but to my mind there was a body of people who had a real interest in maintaining the harbour in the local authority, who were completely excluded from involvement in it.  This is part of a greater malaise at the heart of central government that ignores the capacity of local government to deliver for the local community.  It is not just in this Bill, but it is a whole raft of legislation that excludes elected people, including Oireachtas Members.  The amendments are primarily about councillors and members of local government.  It excludes them from positions like this.<\/p> <p>When Senator Boyhan and I were on the council together, he spoke often about conflicts of interest.  Officials often talk about a conflict of interest, as if, for example, there would not be a conflict of interest if the chief executive of the local authority was serving on the board.  Exactly the same conflict would exist.  One would hope it would exist because one would hope that the chief executive would have similar goals and interests in terms of delivering for the local community, although I suppose that is not necessarily true.<\/p> <p>There is a problem with the overarching view that somehow councillors do not have something to contribute, that they could not deliver at that level or that unlike officials they would not be able to spot the conflict of interests and excuse themselves, even though they are expected to do so at council level all the time, and they do so all the time.<\/p> <p>What these sections and provisions in the Bill ignore is the fact that at local government level, in the 1,000 or so people who are elected to be city or county councillors around the country, there is an enormous body of experience and expertise and perhaps, most importantly, connection to the local area.  By excluding them through what is put into section 48 and later sections, what this totally fails to recognise is the added value they could bring to such a board.<\/p> <p>I mentioned D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company because I believe that one of the major problems the company suffered from during my time on the local authority was the disconnect with the local authority and by extension with the local community.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a result of that, we saw a harbour in decline.  There were major governance problems during that time.  I say that in circumstances where I am not pinning blame on any person in particular, but the fortunes of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour declined significantly over that decade or so.  It just so happens that I do not think it is a coincidence that the council and its councillors were cut out of the deal during that time.<\/p><p>We need to have a reckoning with the powers that are afforded to local councillors and local government.  We need to recognise the position acknowledged in Article 28A of the Constitution and we need to acknowledge the fact that there is a role for these people.  Gone is the day when councillors were people without expertise, education and their own skill set.  In fact, councillors have an enormous skill set that is frequently ignored.  People of enormous qualification and education will be found on local authorities throughout this country.  Even those who are not are generally people of enormous experience.  They have something to add to a board like this.  It is incredibly myopic, if the Minister of State does not mind me saying so because it is not his fault, to continue with this legislation in circumstances where there is this kind of blanket exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas and members of European authorities and local authorities, which is repeated in much of our legislation.  It is an arbitrary \"see no evil, hear no evil\" approach that totally fails to recognise the role these bodies could have.<\/p><p>The conflict of interest argument does not stand up.  It was said already that these are not planning authorities.  Even if they were, councillors have been cut out of the deal on planning at local level in any event.  If there is a conflict of interest, as does arise from time to time on local authorities, councillors are well able to distinguish themselves from that situation.  What is more important, they bring with them expertise and connection to the people who are supposed to be served by MARA and the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of the outcomes of these authorities.  I support the amendment not only because of that contradictory element but, as a general rule, we are cutting off our noses to spite our faces, if we say councillors can never be involved despite the fact that they have a great deal to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#YYY00200","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I support the amendments.  It is particularly egregious if an inequality is created through city and county managers being unable to engage on the one hand, while board members who are, in effect, employees of a Minister, represent a local area where representatives might not.  It is part of a general concern with the Bill and the movement on planning, unfortunately, where local authority members, and those structures people have created to represent concerns and democratic expression, are precluded.  Many people ran for a local authority because they were concerned, had views and expertise, and brought that to the service of their community in areas such as planning.  Those people will be precluded and yet, at the same time, those who may have business interests in these areas are simply trusted and are not precluded.  The Bill may preclude people with business interests, in a limited way, from the CEO role, but they can just recuse themselves when they have a conflict of interest relating to a particular decision.  They can still be in the room most of the time.  That creates an inequality.<\/p> <p>Section 110, which we will come to, is another example of where there are concerns around access to justice and the democratic piece, which are the pieces we already have in planning that include access to justice principles and engagement in the planning process.

This is not to create a conflict because there is a lot to be contributed, but those who may have commercial and business interests and so forth are able to be in the room and recuse themselves using their judgment, as described by Senator Ward, whereas local authority members whose key role and mission is the mandate of expression are placed in a position where, in fact, caring and serving disqualifies them from being able to contribute.<\/p> <p>As I said, I have similar concerns about access to justice and issues around participation in legal action, which will become potentially become more difficult for citizens under this Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>A number of points have been raised by the Senators.

The code of practice for the governance of State bodies covers such matters as the role of the board and chief executive, codes of conduct, ethics in public office, MARA's relationship with the Oireachtas, Minister and parent Department as well as business and financial reporting requirements.<\/p><p>The governance review was completed in advance of the D&aacute;il Report Stage and a number of amendments were proposed on Report Stage and accepted which reflected the best practice recommendations arising from the review.  Some of the amendments proposed on Report Stage related to terms of office of board members, placing the board as decision-maker with regard to the employment of chief executive officer and reducing the time for the production of corporate strategies from five years to three.  I am fully satisfied that MARA as it is set out in the text now provided will operate with a best practice approach to governance from the first day of its establishment.<\/p><p>There may be requirements in the future to review the composition and corporate structure of MARA but that review should only happen once MARA has had the opportunity to show what it can achieve, when it has become operational and existed in a physical rather than purely legislative form.  Following the governance review, I have assurances that MARA as provided for in the text is sound and balanced.  I cannot accept these amendments, which seek to trouble this balance.<\/p><p>I will speak to the issues raised by Senators, particularly Senator Malcolm Byrne, who moved this amendment.  On amendment No. 52, local authority members can apply for a chief executive role but if they are successful, they cannot hold both positions at the same time.  They have to make a decision.  Local authority members can and will be invited to sit on MARA committees, where they can have significant input at a local level.  The issue of D&uacute;n Laoghaire has been raised, and that is where it is most important to have that local decision-making.  The chief executive of MARA will review the governance arrangement and can review this again when appointed.<\/p><p>Another important point is that local authorities will be responsible for DMAPS in their own areas.  This is devolving responsibility to local government where it matters, at local level.  From the point of view of local authority members having a role on behalf of the communities they represent, the mechanism is there to do that.  That should be recognised.  <\/p><p>Senator Higgins raised democratic expression and access to justice.  These themes have run throughout this afternoon's proceedings.  I have an interest in and passion for that, particularly around Aarhus.  In the early days before Aarhus was transposed into Irish law, I took cases around protection of costs in environmental actions taken by NGOs.  This is core to our democracy, to what we are trying to achieve and to the function of NGOs and their participation.  This Government has supported NGOs in their ability to carry out their work and be critical of Government.  It is their right to do that.  The support to ensure NGOs and communities play that vital democratic role in our planning system is important.<\/p><p>I cannot say enough about the role of elected members at local level.  That role is hugely important and valuable.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That has been shown time and again, both in our planning system and in how our development plans or policies come about.

There will be input at local level and so on.  However, he spoke of the chief executive reviewing the governance.  The chief executive cannot change what is within the legislation, and the legislation is clearly excluding from the board of MARA anyone who happens to be a member of a local authority.  Conversely, it ensures that there will be a chief executive of a city or county council on the board.  Senator Ward is correct that the level of skill and qualification of councillors throughout the country is top class.  It is not about any councillor being appointed.  It is if someone, all else being equal, is able to serve on the board and they are only being excluded because they are a member of a local authority.<\/p> <p>I will provide an example.  The Minister of State's colleague, Deputy Leddin from Limerick, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, is an engineer who specialises in renewable energy.  He is the kind of individual who in normal circumstances would be an excellent appointee to the board of MARA.  He is someone who has a deep understanding of many of the areas around renewable energy.  If he was to apply and came out on top over all the other candidates, were he was still a member of Limerick City Council, he would be excluded from being considered for appointment.  That is wrong.  All we seek with this amendment is that the exclusion on that basis be removed.<\/p> <p>I do not have a problem with a city or county manager sitting on MARA, but I am sure that the Minister of State will see where the problem lies.  I have raised this matter but I have not received guidance on it.  It is a fairly minor issue.  It is not about someone tugging at the Minister of State's sleeve who says \"I am a councillor.  Appoint me to the board\".  This is about ensuring that we get the best people on the board and if one of the best people happens to be a councillor that they will not be excluded.  I know the Minister of State is in agreement with us.  I ask him to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#BBBB00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I want to make two points in the context of the Minister of State's reply.  I respect what he said about the importance of the local authorities.  He said that a local authority member is not precluded from becoming a chief executive of MARA.  With respect, that is a slightly silly comparison.  The people who get involved in local authorities do so because they have an interest in getting involved.  Earlier, I referred to a problem with myopia across the Government.  Another problem is the failure to recognise that there is a very particular type of person who makes the sacrifices they make to get involved in local government, and we should make no mistake, that is what is involved.  We are making it harder and harder for people to make that sacrifice.  We are closing more and more avenues for those people by this kind of a provision in legislation which, as I said, exists in several pieces of legislation.  It means that if you want to work as a councillor, you are precluded from doing other things that you might be interested in doing or in which you might have a professional or academic interest or be qualified to do.  I do not think there is a solid basis for that.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne.  Obviously, I accept the Minister of State's bona fides as a former local authority member - he served on a local authority for longer than I did - but there is a general move on the part of the Government away from granting powers to local authorities.  The Minister of State spoke about giving powers to local authorities.  I do not think that is the case.  I do not agree that you can say that they can be involved in committees but not on the board.  I do not think that is empowering them.  It excludes them from the central decision-making body.  The end result is it excludes them from the decision-making process.  My experience in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has shown that to be a bad thing.  There is also the issue that we are telling people that if they become a member of a local authority that they must shut down lots of other aspects of their life, which is a regressive thing to do.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, what we really want is to have the best people available in the pool of individuals who can be made members of board but the provisions in section 48 and other sections specifically preclude that.  The Government is saying that it does not want councillors, whether they are on committees or not, and it is refusing to acknowledge the role they could play.  It is also refusing to widen the pool to the extent that it would include all of the people who might do a very good job.  <\/p><p>This is not, as happened in the past, about jobs for the boys and girls, an issue of public concern.  This is something that is thrown around but in actual fact, we know very well that the Government has put in place a whole load of structures to ensure that the application process is rigorous.  People have to go through interview and qualification processes conducted by independent civil servants who do not give jobs to the boys.  It is not about that.  <\/p><p>In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council there are people, for example, who are very well acquainted with issues in the harbour and who have specific skill sets who are precluded from being on the board and the board suffers as a result.  I do not understand the logic behind pushing this section and saying that we must preclude members of local authorities.  I also do not understand why Members of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament should be excluded but I can see a certain practical logic to that because they are removed from local communities in a way that councillors are not.  Specifically with regard to members of the local authorities, they are close to the ground and close to the very people we hope will benefit from a MARA.  They are connected to the community in a way that an official or ordinary member of the board never will be.  I say this in the context of all kinds of local government activities.  The chief executive, the director of services or the local engineer will never knock on the door of local residents, introduce themselves, ask the residents how they are doing, what they think of something and how they can help.  That is not their job but it is the job of the councillor.  The councillor can transmit the views of the ordinary citizen, the residents of the area, the business owners, the concerned key stakeholders or whatever one wants to call them, right into the centre.  Obviously, assuming they are the type of qualified person we want on the board, they will either accept or reject what people are saying or suggest ways in which we can accommodate public opinion.  One of the real dangers that comes with the MARA is to put in place an authority that is either ignorant of or unconcerned about the issues facing local communities, including residents and businesses.  Having a member of a local authority as a potential member of the board is important.  I am not saying that they should automatically become members of the board in the way, for example, that the old harbours legislation provided but having the option to have an appropriately qualified and positioned member of a local authority as a member of the board is a tremendously important opportunity for the MARA and for this Bill.  It would make this legislation more inclusive and more all encompassing and would ensure that the Bill genuinely does what it seeks to do.  <\/p><p>I understand what the Minister of State has said on this.  I understand that the legislation has already gone through the D&aacute;il and that we are in the last week of term.  There may be a particular view in terms of getting this through but that does not mean that it cannot be done.  It does not mean that the amendment cannot be accepted on a reasoned basis.  It could then be put to the D&aacute;il for approval.  It is a very simple, net issue that could be put to the D&aacute;il if deemed appropriate.  It is very important to recognise that this amendment does not come from a place of trying to cause trouble.  Its aim is to improve the legislation, the board of the MARA and the effectiveness of the authority in order to allow it to function in the best possible way.  I agree with my colleagues that to arbitrarily lock out members of the local authorities who could add so much to the board is a problem.  To do so is a myopic action by Government which will discourage people from getting involved in local politics.  It will discourage people from getting involved in that side of their local community because it shuts them out of so many areas unnecessarily.  I hope the Minister of State will reflect on this and acknowledge that it is a reasonable amendment that could be accepted to improve the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#BBBB00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as possible.

House prices have doubled since 2012.  There was an increase of 12% this year.  There are significant projected increases in house prices if we continue according to the model we have.  <\/p><p>We will come to the many commercial investments shortly.  We have been told the solutions to the housing crisis lie with commercial investments.  In fact, it has been found that, as I think might have been predicted, the priorities of the speculative market are not necessarily aligned with the priorities of the provision of housing.  This is because the goal of a market is to exert every pressure it can in order to maximise the return for its shareholders, in investment funds and so forth.  We have constantly seen a flip whereby affordability has moved away from what we might expect from the houses that are purchased.  Instead, affordability is now about how we bridge the gap between house prices and affordability.  I have spoken about this to the Minister for Housing, Government and Local Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the idea that we must bridge this ever-widening gap in the cost of housing.  This allows and supports the inflation of housing prices, through all of our various investment incentives, mechanisms, measurements and our de-risking of the sector.  Then, we try to bridge that gap by making people pay those higher prices.  While we provide some bridging for them to pay those higher prices, we do not address the core problem, which is the inflation of housing prices.<\/p><p>This recommendation proposes a report on the help-to-buy scheme.  The Minister will be aware that his own officials, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and many other bodies all signalled the concern that the help-to-buy scheme would effectively contribute to the kinds of increases in prices, such as those we are seeing.  While I know that the help-to-buy scheme is not doing this on its own, the scheme simply allows for the bar to keep rising.  It puts yet another measure in place to try to bridge that gap as house prices go up.  Again, the help-to-buy scheme was signalled as having a potential further additional inflationary impact. <\/p><p>I would like if the Minister would be minded to produce a report on the impact of the help-to-buy scheme on the prices and affordability within the housing market.  He might perhaps set out alternative policy options because, having tried multiple versions of the same thing over a decade, it is probably time to consider how we can prioritise housing provision in a way that is not dependent on rooting through a market that seeks to constantly raise and increase its returns.  This could include housing affordability by reducing prices and introducing measures to deflate the cost and prices of houses.  The Minister might outline those, rather than simply increasing credit and indeed increasing debt for our citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#GGGG00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.

First, it is wrong to suggest that the Government is subcontracting out the need to meet housing needs to the private sector.  This year, the State is spending &euro;4.1 billion in either directly building homes itself, or enabling the delivery of more homes.  If one takes even a short walk around Dublin city centre at the moment, one will see the homes that are being completed in, for example, Dominick Street, and Sean Foster Place.  These are all city centre, local authority-built homes.  It is vital, both in this discussion and in the ones that will happen later on in the Finance Bill, to recognise that the State is playing a leading role, not only in regulating the provision of homes but also by directly building homes, or indirectly by funding them.  <\/p> <p>As to the discussion on the help-to-buy scheme, I ask Senators to keep in mind the figure of 12.7% when evaluating the impact of this on the housing market.  This figure of 12.7% is the total number of housing transactions that happened in 2020 that were partially funded by the help-to-buy scheme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not accept that a scheme that only influences less than 13% of all of the transactions for the purchase of homes within the country is of itself a significant cause of house price inflation.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins referred to us increasing credit.  We have macroprudential rules that have constrained the availability of credit.  What the Government has not done in response to the challenges that have been made more acute during the pandemic is look to increase credit or change the rules on borrowing.  Leaving aside the fact that they are decisions made by the Central Bank, which is independent of us, what we have avoided is increases in credit that are driven by changes in rules or Government action.  If higher levels of borrowing are happening, which is the case, in particular by those who are seeking to buy a home for the first time, it is still done in the context of the application of the macroprudential rules.<\/p><p>Section 5 provides for the help-to-buy scheme to continue to apply to applicants who sign a contract for the purchase of a new house or who make the first drawdown of the mortgage in the case of a self-build during 2022.  With regard to the Senator's recommendation, it should be noted that housing policy is primarily a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, so I will limit my comments to tax measures.<\/p><p>As I have stated previously, the need to activate the delivery of additional new houses is an important priority for the Government.  That is why the Government is committed, through Housing for All, to achieving progress, as a matter of the utmost priority, in the interests of the people of Ireland.<\/p><p>In relation to the Senator's points on prices and affordability, policymakers were aware at the time that the scheme was being developed that it was not without risk and that there was a danger that, against a background of constrained supply, the initiative could serve to increase prices for new homes and thus potentially undermine, to some extent at least, the affordability aspiration of the scheme.  However subsequent formal reviews of the scheme did not bear out these fears.  There have been two reviews, one in 2017 and one in 2018.  The main findings were as follows: with regard to prices, while there may have been a very small increase in prices attributable to the introduction of the scheme, the primary driver of house prices remains the continued misalignment between demand and supply.  With regard to affordability, the analysis also found that the availability of the scheme had reduced the time needed to save for a deposit and improved the overall affordability of housing for help-to-buy claimants.<\/p><p>With regard to supply, the evidence suggests that, following the introduction of the scheme, there was an increase in supply which can be attributed, at least partially, to the scheme.  Furthermore, the analysis found a benefit-cost ratio of 1.28, indicating a moderate positive effect for the incentive.<\/p><p>The recent tax strategy group paper on help to buy concluded that should a decision be taken to extend the scheme, there would be a strong case for commissioning a further formal review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme.  The cost, the changing policy context in which the relief operates, and the advent of other non-tax Housing for All measures that have similar objectives, as well as the requirements of the tax expenditure guideline considerations, all support such a move.  Accordingly, I announced in my budget speech that a further formal review of the scheme will take place in 2022.  The review will be fundamental in nature, and it will inform decisions for budget 2023 and finance Bill 2022.  Questions related to who will carry out the review, its terms of reference and a timeline for completion will be determined shortly.<\/p><p>The extension of the scheme for a further 12 months reflects the role it has played in facilitating greater numbers of first-time buyers to make their first step onto the property ladder, while also encouraging the delivery of new housing units by the construction sector.  In addition, as I have noted previously, the extension of the help-to-buy scheme will allow time for other measures in the Housing for All strategy that will operate in the same policy space to be introduced in the period ahead.  In the circumstances, therefore, I do not propose to agree to this recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#GGGG00700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>The Minister mentioned 12.6% of purchases, but if we pick another 12% figure, house prices went up by 12.4% and that is an extremely high level of inflation.  He will be aware that inflation in housing is a massive outlier compared with other levels of inflation.  Inflation in wages does not match this factor.<\/p> <p>While I respect that housing policy is the responsibility of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the fact is that the financial and fiscal policies that have applied to housing have been very strongly directed through budgetary policies.  For example, local authorities were for many years precluded from building or buying because they were encouraged to lease.  Even in the new Housing for All strategy, in excess of 2,000 houses are due to be provided again by leasing.  These are financial decisions.  Leasing has been exposed as extraordinarily poor value for the State.  In the case of cost rental, again, a margin of return for investors was built in to the cost-rental model to ensure a profit.  Every time we add profit into the mix, or in the case of inviting private investors in some of those areas of housing provision where we provide that the financing costs would be incorporated for them, we are effectively adding extra costs to the State, when the State could be directly accessing more of that finance, and could be getting loans at a better rate than the private sector and providing more capacity.  I accept some building is now happening at local authority level, but local authorities are still being pressed into partnerships which come with an additional margin and additional cost.  The policies are dictated by the market.  Affordability is only a percentage lower than the market rather than affordability being based, for example, on a metric of income and what people can earn.<\/p> <p>These are fundamentally financially irresponsible policies that the State has had.  The State has had a choice where it is trying to ride two horses, one which is a property investment market and the other is accommodating the need of the public.  For a long time we have been told these two horses are working in tandem and as soon as we satisfy the private investors they will provide supply.  We should not be in that kind of hostage-to-fortune position.<\/p> <p>With respect, I appreciate there will be a review of the help-to-buy scheme, but the second part of my recommendation, which is what are the policy options in terms of the deflation of house prices, what are our policies to increase housing affordability by reducing prices?  How are we going to dampen this down?  This is the inflation that started galloping when the capital gains tax measures were brought in and has continued apace since.  It is not simply about that scheme.  I do not suggest that, of itself, this is the source of inflation, there are a number of contributing factors, including the de-risking that the State has done by becoming a guaranteed customer in respect of many investment funds, but it is a factor.<\/p> <p>The figures released by the Department of Finance showed 40% of those who benefitted from the help-to-buy scheme already had the necessary deposit.  Did this just contribute, even partially, to the inflation of prices, where the deposit got them less far on the ultimate price of a house?  In 40% of cases, the help-to-buy scheme was not the key determinant in them being able to reach a deposit for the purchase of a house.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#HHHH00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I want to make a brief statement on housing.

Macro-prudential rules are not being dictated by the market.  The State spending &euro;4.1 billion on building homes directly or helping to get them built is not being dictated by the market.  Senator Casey spoke about work happening in his community.  The work Dublin City Council is doing in directly building new homes in the heart of our city centre is not being dictated by the market.  The role of approved housing bodies is not an example of the Government or citizens' housing needs being dictated by the market.<\/p> <p>The Senator's description of housing policy and how it is being developed in our country is fundamentally wrong.  It does not recognise the many interventions being made by the State.  The Land Development Agency, planning regulations and the work of our local authorities are not led by the market.  They are trying to channel the market into helping deliver more homes in the right places.  The Senator spoke about those who are involved in building homes for profit.  What I am about to say feels nearly radical but somebody earning a profit is not a bad thing.  Those who work in our private sector, those who create companies, those who go to work in companies, entrepreneurs, small builders and big builders work really hard at what they do.  They have an expectation that if they work hard, whether they be somebody who is running a building company, a developer or a hotelier, they will earn a reward for their efforts.  In some of the debates that gain a lot of traction within our politics and media, it feels at times as if we are losing sight of the fact that those who work hard, in whatever part of the economy they are working in, have a legitimate expectation to earn a return on their efforts.  That coexists with the Government playing a huge role in building homes in our country.  To describe what we are doing as dictated by the market does not recognise all the things that are being done by this Government, or were done by previous Governments, to try to ensure we have a housing policy that meets more of the needs of our citizens more often.  However, I acknowledge all the difficulties and challenges we face at the moment and how much more we need to do.<\/p> <p>On the recommendation, I will go back to the point I made earlier.  Some 13% of all house transactions in Ireland in 2020 were covered by the help-to-buy scheme.  If it is playing any role in contributing to house price inflation, at 13% it is a small one.  The far bigger issue here is constraint of supply.  We need the private sector to play a role in increasing supply but we also need an active State doing its part too.  That is what is happening.  We want to do it quicker and better but this is not a housing policy that is dictated by the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#JJJJ00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>It is important to be very clear.  I am not objecting to the concept of profits existing.  Nobody objects to that part of business.  The question is whether the State should be factoring in profit levels, dividend levels, reasonable levels of return and profit, and unnecessarily adding profit levels into our expenditure.  I have no problem with private developers that wish to build houses and sell them for profit.  So be it.  I hope they will be appropriately taxed, but I have no problem with them doing that.  My question is about the model of how the State develops.  It is unfortunate that we still do not have a strategy for the deflation of house prices.  That is the fundamental point here.  We have runaway inflation in house prices and further runaway inflation is projected for the future, to the point where home ownership will move out of the reach of most people.  We will come to the build to rent apartments later.  The Minister and I have a difference of opinion on this matter but it is important that we represent each other correctly.  My position is not against the private market existing or, indeed, playing a role in providing housing; my concern is that the State should manage its finances better to ensure it does not unnecessarily build additional costs, such as dividends and profits for shareholders, into the money we spend.  Of course we need to work with people but let us do so from a position of strength that recognises that the State is fundamentally the stronger actor in these situations.  It needs to act as the stronger actor in these agreements and unfortunately we have not seen it do so.  Perhaps the review of the help-to-buy scheme in 2022 will offer potential for further measures to address inflation in pricing.

Transborder workers' relief is for people who are resident in the State but travel daily or weekly to work in another country and pay tax in that other country.  This tax relief is not normally available for Irish residents who work from home in the State.  In light of the unprecedented circumstances arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health restrictions to limit movement, for the tax years 2020 and 2021, Revenue confirmed that a concessional treatment for this relief would apply, whereby if employees are required to work from home in the State due to Covid-19, such days working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met.<\/p><p>The relief effectively removes the earnings from a qualifying foreign employment from the liability to Irish tax where foreign tax has been paid on those earnings and such tax is not refundable.  The effect of the measure means that individuals who qualify for the relief will not pay any Irish tax on their employment income.  Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from the qualifying foreign employment.<\/p><p>There are a number of criteria that must be satisfied for an employee to be eligible.  In particular, the employment duties must be exercised wholly outside of the State in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement.  None of the duties of employment can be performed in the State, save those considered incidental to the performance of the duties outside the State.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance undertook that the operation of the transborder workers' relief would be examined as part of the tax strategy group, TSG, 2021 process, which would consider all relevant matters, including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers, and the established principles of international tax.That paper concluded:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... it appears impracticable from a legal perspective, in terms of taxing rights, as well as challenging from a policy perspective when having regard to the interests of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing all Irish resident employees and employers, to place the concessional treatment on a statutory footing. <\/blockquote> <p>The tax strategy paper reached this conclusion based on issues of taxing rights, equity and competitiveness.<\/p><p>There are issues raised in the paper that are warranted and require due consideration, but other issues were not addressed.  First, section 6 of the paper considered the issue of social insurance and noted that social insurance rates in the North are higher than those in the South.  However, the examples in section 3.2, which considered equity, failed to take account of employee social contributions when comparing the effective tax rates paid in both jurisdictions.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that this is a flaw which undermined the comparison, and would welcome comment from the Minister on that.  Second, the proposal of the Cross-Border Workers Coalition was to limit the number of days that cross-border workers could work from the State to 183 days while still being able to claim the relief.  Third, it proposed that other controls could be introduced, such as limiting the scope to those in non-executive roles and the consideration of a salary threshold.  Given that this is the case and in light of the importance of developing the all-island economy and the move to remote working, we believe the matter warrants further examination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#KKKK01500","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":374,"content":"<p>The Senator is requesting a comprehensive report on transborder workers' relief.

Having regard to current circumstances, I can confirm that Revenue will continue to adopt a pragmatic and flexible approach by allowing for a further extension of the temporary concession.  This extension will apply for the period of time in 2022 during which the public health advice recommends that everyone should work from home unless it is necessary to attend the workplace in person.  I am advised that Revenue issued further guidance on this temporary extension, which is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>More broadly, in relation to the Senator&rsquo;s request for a further report on transborder workers&rsquo; relief, as I said, a comprehensive examination of the issue was undertaken by the TSG that encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters, including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. <\/p><p>Ordinarily to avail of the relief, the duties of employment must be performed wholly outside the State and in a country with which Ireland has a double taxation agreement.  When examining whether the temporary concession should be placed on a statutory footing, the TSG review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers.<\/p><p>The review noted that if the temporary concession regarding transborder workers&rsquo; relief was placed on a statutory footing, it would allow residents in the State to avail of the relief while working in the State and pay no tax to the Exchequer in respect of the foreign employment income.  Where employment duties are carried out in the State, Ireland has a taxing right over that income and to not tax that income would be asking the State to give up a taxing right it rightfully has under the Irish tax code.  It is unclear why Ireland would not exercise those taxing rights and it is unclear also how another jurisdiction would then have taxing rights over income earned in the State in respect of duties carried out in the State. <\/p><p>The review identified issues relating to equity for all Irish taxpayers.  Currently, there may be different tax liabilities and different effective tax rates between those Irish residents who can avail of the relief as compared to those who cannot.  However, there is a key distinguishing factor in that the employment duties are exercised outside the State for a non-resident employer.  The move to increased levels of remote working, including blended working arrangements, within the State weaken that critical distinction.<\/p><p>If transborder workers&rsquo; relief was relaxed to allow for work carried out in the State to qualify for the relief, there would no longer be a distinguishing factor between Irish residents as both sets of Irish residents would be exercising their employment duties in the State.  In such circumstances, some - those with Irish resident employers - would be liable to tax at the Irish tax rates with income tax and USC, and a potentially higher effective tax rate, while others, those with non-resident employers, would be liable to tax at the tax rates in the other jurisdiction and a potentially lower effective tax rate.  This is an example of some of the issues of equity that arise with regard to the report the Senator is requesting.  Revenue has given an indication that it will extend the relief on a pragmatic basis given the current public health guidance.  I am prepared to continue to look at the matter as I accept it causes issues for those affected by the current public health guidance and the need for them to work in their homes while their employer is located in another tax jurisdiction.  However, for the reasons I have outlined, there are really important issues of principle that mean that I am not in a position to make the kind of change the Senator is advocating for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#KKKK01600","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

Emerging from the pandemic it is clear as never before that we need a more agile and responsive State, a stronger social safety net, a health service that works and a public childcare option for parents that is genuinely affordable. This can only be done through an increase in tax revenue in the form of additional taxation or less in the way of tax expenditure.

It would increase the effective tax rate of a full rate PRSI individual income of &euro;150,000 to 45.1%.  Withdrawing PAYE and earned income tax credits at the previously proposed rate of 5% from those with taxable income above &euro;100,000 would create an effective rate of 64.2% between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000 per year.<\/p><p>The British tax system incorporates a personal tax allowance which is subject to a tapered withdrawal for individuals whose income is in excess of &pound;100,000 per annum.  In this context it is worth noting that the tax allowance allows relief at a taxpayer's marginal rate whereas the PAYE and earned income credits are standard rate tax credits.  The allowance is reduced by &pound;1 for every &pound;2 earned above this limit, tapering out in the 2017-2018 tax year once income reaches &pound;123,000.  The &pound;100,000 threshold was chosen as all individuals with income above that level were already obliged to file a tax return each year.  This facilitated the operation of the taper.  By contrast there is no similar liability to file a tax return based on income level in Ireland at present.  That would likely need to be reviewed were the policy of tapering the credits to be pursued.  There is real merit in calling for these reports and I hope the Minister will support the recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#LLLL00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The Senator&rsquo;s recommendations refer to reports on first, the tapering out of income tax credits at certain incomes and, second, the introduction of a high income levy.  First, regarding tapering of income tax credits, there is already a substantial amount of research published on this subject.  The income tax reform plan published by my Department in July 2016 examined this issue due to the fact that the Programme for a Partnership Government contained a commitment to consider the removal of the PAYE credit for high earners as part of a medium-term income tax reform plan.  It pointed out that there are a number of technical issues and policy issues which would need to be addressed in order to achieve a tapered withdrawal of income tax credits, particularly for PAYE employees.  The issue was also discussed in the 2018 tax strategy group papers on income tax.  It is estimated that the tapering out of the personal income tax credit, PAYE credit and earned income tax credits in the manner outlined by the Senator could raise in the region of &euro;855 million per annum.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A significant issue arising with this amendment is that it would have a negative impact on the marginal rate of tax.  The tapering out of a tax credit would result in a higher marginal tax rate within the taper zone than would apply at higher income levels.  By way of example, were the personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 to be tapered out at a rate of 5% per &euro;1,000, the marginal rate within the taper zone would be just over 60%.  Once the taper period has expired, at income over &euro;120,000, the marginal rate would revert to 52%.<\/p><p>Another issue that has been pointed out in previous research is that tax credits and rate bands operate on a cumulative basis as Revenue issues a revenue payroll notification to the individual&rsquo;s employer, which then uses the information contained in the notification to calculate the tax to be deducted each time a payment is made.  If it is known from the beginning of the year that an employee's income will exceed the chosen threshold, then the application of the taper of the credits could be applied from the outset, thereby spreading the tax burden equally over the year.  However, where it appears during the course of the year that the employee&rsquo;s income may exceed the chosen threshold, Revenue will need to update the Revenue payroll notification to withdraw the relevant credits and this will result in the collection of arrears from the next payment of salary by the employer, resulting in an uneven distribution of its liabilities over the year and an uneven distribution of the yield for the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Tapering the tax credits could also affect the relative position of different categories of taxpayer.  For example, consideration would need to be given to how the taper would work in the case of jointly assessed individuals, such as whether the value of a single personal tax credit or that of a married personal tax credit would be subject to the taper, and what income threshold would apply to a single-income couple.  In addition, the effect of a deduction such as a loss available in respect of one spouse would need to be considered where the couple are jointly assessed for tax.<\/p><p>Regarding the amendment for a report on introducing a high-income levy on incomes in excess of &euro;140,000, there are a number of issues with the proposal the Senator has suggested, as it would increase the complexity of the income tax system and could negatively impact on marginal rates of tax as well as the competitiveness of our tax code.  While the Senator has not specified a specific percentage for the levy, for illustrative purposes, if a 5% levy was introduced on the basis of the current structure of the income tax charge, it is estimated it could yield &euro;505 million per annum.  However, this would see the current two-rate income tax system expand to become a three-rate system.  If introduced on the basis of the current structure of USC, it is estimated that such a 5% charge could yield an additional &euro;520 million per annum but would see the current five rate USC system increase to six rates.  This would be in addition to the PRSI system, which has further distinct features and would introduce complexity and an unnecessary additional administrative burden for taxpayers, employers and Revenue.  The introduction of a higher rate such as this would increase the marginal rate of tax on earnings over &euro;140,000 to 57% for employees and 60% for the self-employed if it was introduced as an income tax rate.<\/p><p>I believe those kinds of marginal tax rates would be a deterrent to the continued retention of workers in our economy, including individuals who earn a lot of money, whose presence here is important to the retention of jobs in Ireland.  A practical example of this is hospital consultants.  The difficulties we have in attracting consultants who were trained in Ireland but are working abroad to come back to work in our hospital system are well known.  Rates such as those I have outlined would be a deterrent to encouraging those highly trained consultants to come back to work in our public services.  There is a public service argument for why I would not accept this amendment, and a broader issue with the competitiveness of our economy and the need for personal tax rates to be competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#LLLL00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the extended reply.

When it comes to ordinary working people, for much of the past six months, we have heard that pandemic unemployment payments are too much and employers are no longer able to find workers.  There is one rule in place for people on low incomes and one for people on high incomes.  The Minister's refusal to countenance even a report on what could be achieved by tapering income tax credits and a levy on high incomes puts him to the right of the British Tory party.  Even Johnson, perhaps the worst and most extreme prime minister in recent times, has acknowledged that tapering income tax credits is important.

We do not have to include a protection from tax for all those on higher incomes.  If the concern is consultants, the mechanisms exist in the State's contracts with them.  Among many of the concerns with regard to retention, tax has not featured highly.  The terms and conditions, including those related to the silencing of consultants who engage in public debate, have been prominent factors in the discussions.  The tax rate is something of a red herring.<\/p> <p>The capital flight we have heard about over the years is not a sufficient argument.  Taking the idea that a 5% levy will lead to large numbers of high earners leaving and taking their jobs with them, if those are the priorities of managers to such a degree that a marginal difference in their income tax will determine whether they will carry out business in a state, even with favourable corporate tax measures in that state, that is questionable.  Those are maybe side points.<\/p> <p>The core point is that these are reasonable recommendations.  Regarding recommendation No. 4, if there is a fall-off after &euro;140,000, there is nothing to stop the Minister from bringing a counterproposal or indicating interest in a further report whereby he would look to continuing the tapering beyond &euro;140,000 to avoid that disconnect.  The crucial matter here is the idea of a high-income levy and the reluctance to look at that, with the idea that it is too complex.  People earning &euro;140,000 or more can handle the additional complexity.  It is a very small additional complexity for persons on a substantial income, which would place them in the top 10% of earners in the State.<\/p> <p>It is financially responsible to consider our GNI* and how we ensure its maintenance.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been clear that we cannot continue to over-rely on the substantial windfall revenue that we have had from corporate taxes.  It stated that we need to make sure we maintain a predictable and steady income tax.  We should look at options such as a high-income levy.  It is hard to look at this and not look at the fact that tax cuts are being talked about.  We have heard the extreme measures in transformative public expenditure that are required.  Tax cuts are expenditure.  The idea that expenditure would go towards tax reliefs rather than public investment is a real concern.  It affects public investment in the things that we share, including our collective public services and State measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If we have a return of the fiscal rules, as the Minister has advocated for, and the ratios which the junior Minister spoke about when he was before the Seanad on the Finance Bill, then, if we consider the ratio of revenue to debt, by taking down revenue in any sense through tax reliefs or by failing to ensure a steady and continuous revenue by bolstering GNI*, not only is that money taken out of circulation for public investment but the ratio between income, expenditure and deficit also changes.  It, therefore, becomes harder for us to spend on the other side, so we are losing twice on public investment in that context if we have tax cuts.  We are taking away from one side of the scales and lowering the other side.  It is surprising that tax cuts are being talked about now, even though the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been clear about the need for us to be clear.

The two Senators will always see work as something to be taxed at a higher level.  They will always see companies, entrepreneurs and innovation as things to get more tax from.  They, frankly, ignore the fact that other countries want the innovative companies that are located in Ireland.  That is an inescapable fact of having a small, open economy in which ideas and people are mobile.  I find it extraordinary that in the arguments and facts the Senators have put forward to me, they give no credence to the fact that we already have one of the most progressive tax codes in the OECD.  They have not acknowledged that at all.  I will put the facts in that regard onto the record of the House.  A single person who earns &euro;120,000 in Ireland pays an average effective tax rate of 40.4%.  If the same person earns &euro;20,000, that tax rate is 6.4%.  As one earns more in Ireland, one's average tax rate goes up as one's marginal tax rate goes up.  Those are facts that are fundamental to considering how progressive and effective our tax code is.  Those facts are relevant to the debate we are having here.<\/p> <p>The Senators suggest that a higher tax rate for income above &euro;140,000 would not have consequences that bear consideration.  I believe those consequences would be difficult and potentially damaging for our economy.  It is not an easy argument to make because somebody who is earning more than &euro;140,000 is exceptionally well paid, but those individuals have ideas, skills and training.  They may have people reporting to them who I want to keep in our country.  That is a difference between the Senators and me.<\/p> <p>Senator Gavan suggested we have a different rule for people who are on low to middle incomes and those who are on higher incomes.  If one is on a lower level of income, one's average effective tax rate is lower than those who are on higher levels of income.  We have proposed tax changes that will primarily benefit those who are on low and middle incomes and the Senator's party voted against it.  Sinn F&eacute;in thinks it is okay for somebody who is on the average wage in our country to continue to pay the higher rate of income tax.  It is comfortable with that and wants that to be maintained.  I disagree.  I believe that if people earn a few extra euro each year due to getting a promotion, staying longer in a job, doing some overtime, getting a new role within their company or changing companies, it is appropriate that we look to ensure they do not always pay a high marginal rate of tax as their income goes up due to their efforts.  <\/p> <p>I make a similar point to Senator Higgins.  She does not believe there is any role for a change in our tax policy as prices and incomes are going up.  In the model the Senator has espoused, as incomes go up, as they are, and as prices go up, as they are, tax revenue will go up and those who are on low levels of income will progressively end up paying higher and higher rates of tax.  That is something I believe we should be proactive in trying to change.  The measures we brought forward in the budget are all about ensuring that somebody who is earning between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 is not always paying the highest rate of income tax.  I believe we should change that.<\/p> <p>In the arguments they put forward to me, why can the Senators not acknowledge that we already have a very progressive personal tax code here in Ireland?  There are high marginal rates of income tax for those who see their incomes grow and average rates of income tax that mean those on high incomes already pay higher levels of taxation than those who are on lower levels of income.  For those reasons, I believe the tax changes we are making at the moment are appropriate.  I am not going to accept this recommendation, which provides for a report, because I do not believe the Finance Bill is an appropriate location for committing to reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#NNNN00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>If we get into a back and forth, it will probably not be particularly productive, to be fair.

We need that tax and we will need it in the years to come.  One of the reasons we have exactly half the ICU beds we are supposed to have in this country, and we were told we would need in the 2009 Prospectus report, is because, year after year, this Government, unfortunately, did not ring-fence funding to expand the numbers of beds until such time as the crisis hit last year.  That is a fundamental failure of planning and delivering ICU beds.  That is a fact.  We know we have one of the lowest rates of ICU beds in Europe.  That is a fact.  My point is that rather than being opportunistic, we are looking for ways to raise revenue in a sensible fashion over the coming years to ensure we can pay for decent public services.

There is a redistributive function through our taxation system but it is redressing extremely high income disparity and income inequality.  If we are committed to the idea of progressive taxation, a third level is something that perhaps needs to be looked at down the line, and that would be consistent with a progressive system.  It would be recognising that, for example, somebody earning &euro;140,000 is not the same as somebody earning &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000.

We know we need to build more.  For Senator Gavan and Sinn F&eacute;in to position the pandemic as an example of public service failure, as his fellow spokespersons do all of the time, is a narrative I completely reject.  Our public services came under strain and we need to invest more and support them in future.  Our health services, hospital beds, nurses and doctors faced a huge challenge and many of them faced unimaginable strain in the work they were doing, nonetheless the State overall, facing huge tests in this pandemic, has managed to reduce the number of people who died in the country, put in place a really good vaccination campaign and protect the economy.

Following that, it introduced legislation that would allow landlords to increase already unaffordable rents by another 2%, which is madness.  These rent rises are the first data set reflective of the changes made to the rent pressure zone legislation that linked rents to inflation.<\/p><p>The report shows that 17 counties had double-digit rent inflation.

However, as I explained, it was abolished in budget 2011 and it is no longer available to those who commenced renting for the first time from 8 December 2010 onwards.  This was on foot of a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief could increase the cost of private rented accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of re-introducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.<\/p> <p>In fairness to the Senator's colleague, Deputy Doherty, he acknowledged this point and argued on Report Stage that the measure be accompanied by a rent freeze for the period that the proposed support is in place.  In reply, I would argue that the evidence suggests that long-term rent controls can give rise to their own problems, including a reduced number of landlords being available to provide rental accommodation in the first place.

At the same time, we are at the point at which \"landlord\" has now become nearly a term of abuse in the way Sinn F&eacute;in uses it.  That is the reality of the debate we are in.  Every time Sinn F&eacute;in members use the word \"landlord\", they drip with invective about them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need more rental accommodation in Ireland and we need more landlords willing to supply that rental accommodation.  To call someone a landlord is a term of abuse on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Senator talks about the challenges that tenants are facing but in the debate in the D&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against an extension of a tax relief that seeks to support landlords with the expense of turning unused rental accommodation into rental accommodation they can rent out.  What will Sinn F&eacute;in say to the families who will be looking for rental accommodation in the future and who will be looking to have a better chance of finding a property they will be able to rent in the future when Sinn F&eacute;in voted against a measure that seeks to support landlords in making more rental accommodation available?  We have to acknowledge what Sinn F&eacute;in's arguments are doing to the many challenges we have in the supply of rental accommodation in Ireland.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan talks about the Fine Gael record in the housing market and I accept that there is much we need to do better, that we need to get more homes built more quickly and that they need to be more affordable.  Our record is that we were in government at a time when there was not enough money available in our country to build the homes that needed to be built where they needed to be built.  Year after year we have taken the measures and put in place the policies and money that have seen the amount of homes that are built by local authorities increase over time and the number of homes that are being built in our country increase over time.  We acknowledge that for many it is not enough and that it is not happening quickly enough.  The Senator cannot on the one hand argue that more needs to be done to provide more rental accommodation while on the other hand he continues to use the word \"landlord\" as a term of abuse.  He cannot do both.  The Government accepts that there is a huge challenge in how we can make more homes available for rent but we believe that the measures the Senator is proposing are a recipe for fewer homes and higher rents.  It is for those reasons I am not accepting the Senator's recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#OOOO00700","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Does the Senator wish to make a comment before I put the recommendation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#PPPP00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>We are not finished yet.

The Senator can come here and take the stance he has taken because he is not responsible.  He just wants a political line on a video clip.  We need landlords and what has happened with them in the last two years?  We lost 1,600 landlords last year and we have lost over 2,000 this year.  This Government has brought in six Acts to control rents in the two years it has been in government.  The interference of this Government in the housing market is the largest single investment in the history of the State.  Some 50% of all houses delivered by this Government are controlled by the Government, be that through local authority housing, affordable housing or cost rental.  Some 50% of the keys given out to individuals in this country are as a direct result of this Government's policy on housing.  It is the single biggest intervention in the housing market ever.  We have managed to build over 22,000 houses this year, despite being shut down for three months and we had commencements of over 31,000 units already in November of this year.  We are addressing it and we are beginning to deliver.  Everybody says it is all about supply.  It is about supply and we are getting there through difficult times but let us not run down Housing for All and Rebuilding Ireland before that.  They are delivering but we need landlords. All Sinn F&eacute;in's policy is doing is scaring landlords out of the market and making the situation worse than it already was.  Some 86% of our landlords only own two properties or less.  Over 90% of them own one property or less.  These are the people Sinn F&eacute;in is targeting and running down every day.

It is important to table them again, however.  Currently, REITs do not pay capital gains tax when they are disposing of a property.  The tax is only paid at the point where dividends are distributed to shareholders.  The argument is often made around double taxation.  I do not believe that applies here, however, because considerable things happen and in many businesses and many areas of activities, tax is paid along the way over different activities that happen.  It is notable that in terms of IREFs, taxable events are not considered to be the disposal of an asset or the collection of rent.  This seems to me to be a very significant omission.<\/p><p>I urge the Minister to take on board my recommendation, which would seek first of all to look at the options for the introduction of capital gains tax at a rate of 33% where REITs, IREFs, or groups of REITs or IREFs, dispose of a property and its property rental business, and the introduction of a potential stamp duty surcharge on REITs that are buying up residential properties.  Again, that is something on which more could be done.<\/p><p>I refer to the effect of REITs on the supply and price of residential housing in the rental market.  This is a factor.  REITs are effectively competing with first-time buyers.  That is part of it.  We talked about things that are driving up inflation and prices.  It is certainly not solely the help-to-buy scheme.  Another factor is the fact that first-time buyers are competing against REITs.  Killian Woods has given very detailed analysis and examples of this in his reporting, as have others, where local authorities must compete with REITs in terms of the purchase of housing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->REITs that have the potential of getting leasing contracts with local authorities or others are effectively outbidding local authorities for what is often a limited supply of private housing for purchase in rural and other areas, as described earlier by Senator Casey.  Local authorities then find themselves forced into leasing properties on which they were outbid.  We need to know the effect of REITs on the supply and the price of residential housing, whether they are part of the inflationary effect if help-to-buy is only a small factor and their impact on residential properties available on the open market for private purchase.  These are two factors that I hope the Minister might be able to address.

I am an admirer of the skills of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, but what is wrong with the current Government is that we are not facing up to a fundamental issue, namely, the level of capital gains tax.  When I served as Opposition spokesperson on finance for the Progressive Democrats in 2002, I proposed an amendment to the Finance Bill to reduce the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  Former Deputy Charlie McCreevy, who later became Minister for Finance, was an Opposition spokesperson as well and he and I teamed up on this matter.  I had the good grace to lose my seat in the following election so my tuppence worth was simply offered on that day.<\/p> <p>I strongly believe that the rate of capital gains tax is too high.  I am looking at what is coming down the tracks in this debate by way of recommendations.  For example, there is a suggestion in recommendation No. 14 that the rate of capital gains tax be brought back up to 40%.  I am strongly of the view that we need to have a 20% rate of capital gains tax.  I fully understand that people will say that we are already taking 35% or 40% of basic income and this, that and the other by way of taxation, and question how this would square up in terms of equity to a capital gains tax rate of 20%.  On becoming Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy had the bottle to pursue his own views, expressed in opposition, and reduce the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  The result was a 500% increase in the yield from capital gains tax.  This poses a fundamental issue for elected politicians: do you put theory before practice or practice before theory?  My strong view is that a low rate of capital gains is a sensible arrangement in order to keep assets moving within an economy and that the rate of 33%, which was introduced in the aftermath of the financial crisis, was a knee-jerk reaction, which, I can well understand, was politically sensible at the time.  We should, however, take a look at it now from the perspective of what transactions we are inhibiting.  There are many people who, when they look at various transactions that are open to them, will note that a consequence of proceeding with one particular course of action is that 33% of the nominal gain that will accrue on that transaction will go straight to the Exchequer and their reaction is to hold off and to hang on to the asset in the hope that at some future date there will be a different regime.<\/p> <p>I consider the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, a friend and a good and decent man.  He took the bull by the horns and cut the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  There was huge opposition to that at the time.  It was regarded as ideologically indefensible, but the result was a 500% increase in the yield to the Exchequer.  Leaving aside the housing bubble and the rest of it, when that money came in, it was available to the Exchequer to expend on redistribution and other things.  A stance should be taken in this House against the current rate of capital gains tax of 33%.  It should be reduced to 20%.  In the final analysis, one can, of course, look to compare that with the higher rate of income tax, PRSI, etc., but I am convinced that the Minister should look at the outturn of such a low rate of taxation.  I am convinced that if the rate of capital gains tax was reduced from 33% to 20% the result would be a very substantial taxation boost.  The former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, proved that that was correct.<\/p> <p>I can well appreciate that in the aftermath of the property market crash, the credit squeeze and all the rest of it, the Government of the day thought that on equity grounds, because we were burden-sharing across the economy, it should be increased from 20% to 33%, but the Department of Finance is not infallible.  Very few of the people in the Department engage in any activity that would attract capital gains tax.  There is a different world outside Merrion Street.  That world is one in which the disincentive effect of taking one third of all capital gains by way of taxation is significant.  The proof of the pudding is what happened when the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, reduced the rate.  I hope nobody is listening to me because on the basis of stamp duty measures that I once proposed they will probably think that this is a serious possibility.  It is not in the mind of the current Government but a future Government should face up to the fact that 20% is the appropriate rate for capital gains tax to keep assets moving, transactions happening and to stop people engaging in massive tax avoidance schemes.  There are transactions that are necessary.  People who own land and who are faced with the proposition of whether to put it on the market often decide not to do so because before anything else happens, one third of the gains will accrue to the State.  I am of the view that 20% is the appropriate rate for capital gains tax, as it is for the lowest rate of income tax, and that it should remain at that level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#SSSS00200","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I want to speak to recommendation No. 13 in particular which, as Senator Higgins stated, is similar to her recommendation.

Investment funds in the housing market pay no capital gains tax on disposal of their assets.  We have just heard an interesting contribution from Senator McDowell, who argued for a lowering of the rate to 20%.  I disagree with him.  I am sure he will be relieved to hear that as well.  We are talking about investment funds paying zero capital gains tax on the disposal of their assets.  When property or land is sold at a profit it is normal practice that it is subject to capital gains tax at 33%, which is payable within a few months of disposal.  This applies to individuals and companies, including large developers such as Glenveagh and Cairn Homes, but REITs and IREFs are exempt.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paul Gavan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This exemption is a massive and unjustified benefit for funds to keep accumulating money within a fund, tax free, with none of these gains subject to dividend withholding tax unless the money leaves the fund.  It is striking that we have these outrageous tax reliefs for REITs and IREFs that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael want to defend, while those parties have just voted against giving a tax break to ordinary renters.  That is some contrast.<\/p><p>I will provide two examples.  Last year, Kennedy Wilson sold one of its key Irish properties, Baggot Plaza in Dublin, for &euro;141 million to a German property investor at a profit of $85 million, with these gains exempt from capital gains tax, CGT.  Kennedy Wilson made clear that these proceeds, exempt from CGT, would be \"recycled into new opportunities\", which is a tax advantage not available to struggling homebuyers, small landlords or any other company.  Yes, I used the word \"landlord\" but, hopefully, the Minister will approve.  Similarly, last year, IRES REIT sold an 151-apartment portfolio to Orange Capital for &euro;48 million.  Again, this was a sale that was exempt from capital gains tax.  If we are to rebalance our housing system, one that is out of control and failing in the delivery of affordable homes for purchase and rent, we must examine and remove the generous tax advantages that have been gifted to funds by this Government, including capital gains tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#SSSS00300","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>We are heading into a debate on capital gains.

We would much prefer to have those properties as part of the housing stock.

This is not an ideological thing.  It is about increasing the capacity of assets to flow into the market.  A capital gains tax of one third is indefensible in that context.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan mentioned the Government's view of the proposal to give some income tax relief on rental payments to taxpayers who are not entitled to other reliefs.  I voted in favour of that because I genuinely believe that people are being very heavily gouged by the housing shortage in respect of the rental payments they are making, especially in Dublin, where some of the payments being exacted by landlords and market forces are extraordinarily high.<\/p><p>The fundamental issue is whether we want assets coming into or going out of the market.  As long as we have 33% capital gains tax, many assets will be withheld from market activity.  On the point Senator Gavan made about a rate of 33%, 20% or 40%, it has to be borne in mind that it is not just a matter of how fair we think this is on some abstract level.  If assets become more mobile and come into the market more quickly, that has a market effect.  The market cannot be misunderstood.  It is a thing where some assets are stodgy and will not become involved in sales and transactions, if 33% capital gains tax is applied to them.  Charlie McCreevy took an awful lot of stick for his welfare reforms and so on, but he proved, in fairness to him, that if the rate is reduced, the yield is quintupled.  That is what he did with a reduction from 40% to 20%.  I do not think the yield would be quintupled at present but I believe the capital gains tax yield would be doubled or trebled, if the rate was reduced from 33% to 20%.<\/p><p>I strongly support a review of capital gains taxation.  I know it is politically difficult.  The Minister is probably thinking what his partners in government, the left and all <i>The Irish Times<\/i>columnists, with the exception of Senator McDowell, would think of it, but I honestly believe that the current rate of capital gains taxation is one of the influences on the market that is in fact working against the mobilisation of assets in order to deal with the housing shortage.

I will not call a vote on this matter but I am saying this is a case where effectiveness trumps ideology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#TTTT00300","speaker":"1669"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":419,"content":"<p>A whole variety of issues have been raised in this debate, from the taxation of REITs and IREFs to the issue of taxes on capital raised by Senator McDowell.  I will say a word about each of the points I have heard.<\/p> <p>I will begin with Senator McDowell's point regarding the level of transactions we have in our economy being influenced, in the first place, by the level of tax on those transactions, a point with which I agree.  That is my opening point on where we stand with our housing market at present.  I keep saying this every time we get into any debate about housing, but I absolutely appreciate the stress that is caused to many by what is happening with their rents, the worry so many have about their future and whether they will ever be able to buy their own home, and the insecurity that is being caused for many in our society who, despite their best efforts, worry that they will not be able to afford their rent in future or have a roof over their heads on which they are paying their own mortgage.  With any issue that is so complex and causing such deep worry at present, unfortunately, the answers we are putting forward are ones that will make a difference over time.  People, however, want a very quick response, they want homes to be built immediately and they want easy answers that are capable of delivering quick solutions.  I understand why they want that, given the level of concern at present.<\/p> <p>This brings me to the issue of REITs and IREFs and the role they play.  I contend that their role has to be looked at in the context of the role the State is already playing.  The largest builder of homes in our country at present is the State.  This year, &euro;4.1 billion has been invested in directly building or supporting the delivery of more homes.  I will keep saying this again and again in this debate because I keep hearing the assertion that we have a housing policy that is led by the market.  We have a housing policy in which the market plays a role.  Those are two fundamentally different things.  The areas of planning regulation, the Land Development Agency and local authorities, in particular, have not had more active building programmes for many years than those they currently have.<\/p> <p>The examples of this are literally concrete.  If the Leas-Chathaoirleach goes to Dominick Street, he will see the quality of the accommodation that is being built by Dublin City Council and people who have been waiting for a home for too long, which I accept, now moving into accommodation and apartments that are of extraordinary quality, as they should be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a rich country, which we are, and with the national income growth we have had in recent years, we should be in a position to build local authority accommodation of that kind of quality.  It is being built.  We will have tenants moving into such accommodation soon, for example, the development at Sean Foster Place, just down the road from the King's Inns.  Senator McDowell should look at the accommodation that is being built at the moment, which will be opened in March.  It is state-of-the-art accommodation being built by Dublin City Council.  Examples of that have been replicated all over the country by local authorities.  After many years of difficulty, due to the aftermath of the previous crisis, they have had the levels of funding in recent years which is bearing fruit and reaping dividends in new homes being built.  That is relevant to the discussion that we are about to have on REITs and IREFs because if we want to make the kind of progress year-on-year on housing that we must make, we need more supply.  We need more homes to be built.  It is an increasingly unfashionable argument to make, both here in the Seanad and elsewhere, that the private sector has a role to play in the delivery of those homes, but it does.  The Government cannot build every home that every citizen wants at every price level they want.  The private sector has a role to play in that.  If we want more homes to be built, which I do, and I believe this House does, there is a role for the private sector in doing that.<\/p><p>That simple argument leads on to a complex point, which is what is the role of REITs and IREFs.  An increasing number of people do not want them to play a role in the country.  I ask them to consider whether we want savings from other parts of the world to play a role in the provision of homes in this country.  Do we want pensions that are being built up in other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world to play a role in the delivery of homes in our country?  Do we want those who have saved money elsewhere to play a role in building more homes, especially more apartments?  I believe the answer to that question is \"Yes\".  The reason is that we are a small economy.  Two banks have left the country.  We have two banks of scale and a third bank that is trying to build up scale.  We have a young and growing population.  We need billions of euro of additional investment from the private sector every year in addition to the billions of euro that the State is providing to build more homes.  They are complex and increasingly unfashionable arguments to make but we cannot wish away that reality.  If we want more homes being built in the country, there is a role for private capital in doing that, and by private capital I mean savings that we make or savings that people make in other parts of the world that they want to be used in a productive way.  If we, as a country, decide we do not want that capital, which is the argument that is being put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in, we should be under no illusion that if we decide to change the taxation structure of REITs and IREFs &ndash; I understand why that is an attractive argument &ndash; that is investment that simply will not come to Ireland.  It is savings that will be used elsewhere.  I believe that those savings have a role to play in the provision in particular of certain kinds of apartments in this country, especially in Dublin city, which in turn will have an important effect of increasing the overall supply and allowing existing housing stock to be used in a different way.  That argument may be one that will take time to have an effect, but ultimately, I believe it is part of the answer to what is a very difficult and very complex set of dilemmas that we face in housing at the moment.<\/p><p>The argument that is then made, for example, by Senator Gavan this evening, is that REITs do not pay capital gains tax.  He is partially correct in what he said, which is very typical of the arguments that Sinn F&eacute;in is making currently on many areas of public policy.  It is the case that capital gains tax is not paid by a REIT when a gain is made, but of course where the tax is paid is when the income is distributed from a REIT or IREF, which is exactly the same way we tax pensions.  We do not tax the gain that is made in a pension, we tax the gain when the income is distributed from a pension.  For the record, when income is distributed from a REIT, a dividend withholding tax is paid on it of 25%.  If an Irish investor receives that income, if the person is an individual, he or she must pay tax at the personal tax rate and a company must pay corporate tax on it.  An international investor in an Irish REIT will pay tax on the income received from the REIT according to the tax paid in the investor's own jurisdiction.  Tax is paid when the income is distributed.  There is also a withholding tax in place for IREFs at 20%.  That is where the tax is paid.  Then again, depending on one's jurisdiction, one will then pay perhaps even additional tax on top of that.  I know these are complex arguments in the face of arguments that say that REITs and IREFs should pay more tax or do not pay any tax at all, as some would assert, but that is where the tax is paid.  There is a simple point at the heart of all of this complexity, and all of this technical language regarding withholding taxes, taxable events and what a REIT or IREF is, it is whether we want private capital to play a role alongside an active State in more homes being built in Ireland.  I make the case in the Seanad this evening that the answer to that question is \"Yes\", because we are a small, open economy with a limited level of capital ourselves, with a young and growing population and we need more homes to meet our needs and, within that, the private sector has a role to play.<\/p><p>That is not to say that our housing policy is led by the private sector or that our housing policy equals the private sector.  For those who make the claim that that is what the Government is doing, they should walk up Dominic Street and look at Sean Foster Place and what is happening at the moment.  They should walk around Sean McDermott Street at the heart of my constituency and look at St. Mary's Mansions.  I hear again this evening from the Opposition the condemnation of the role played, for example, by approved housing bodies, and leasing in the work of local authorities.  They should look at the extraordinary renovations that have been made to St. Mary's Mansions in the heart of Sean McDermott Street.  It is local authority accommodation that was run by Dublin City Council and it is now looked after by an approved housing body.  Let them make the argument to the tenants who are now living in the apartments in a quality of accommodation that they deserve, that is far better than what they had a few years ago.  The reality is that has now happened for them.<\/p><p>I make these arguments because there are consequences to the debate we are having.  If we increasingly indicate as a country that we are unwilling to allow a role for private capital investment in either the provision of homes or jobs in this country, that will have consequences, but that is an argument that I am going to engage in and I am going to make the case here for a role for that kind of capital investment supported by the State, which has never invested more in housing and is determined to make a difference.<\/p><p>In response to the argument put forward by Senator McDowell, I must choose my words carefully in this regard, because if there is any area of taxation in which my words will be scrutinised, it is in regard to taxes on capital and capital transactions.  I remind the House that we have a Finance Bill before the House that is not making any significant changes to the level of taxation on capital transactions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I wish to make one point to Senator McDowell on the argument he has brought forward.  At the outset this evening, I said I believe there is a relationship between the tax you have in a transaction and the number of transactions that occur.  However, we are in an economy that at the moment, for extraordinary reasons, is now experiencing many capacity constraints and shortages.  Those relate to people to do work or to the kind of capacity an economy needs to ensure that if a transaction happens, it can be executed at normal and affordable prices.  There is an economic cycle to the Senator's argument that bears consideration.  One can ask whether we are at the right point in our economy at which changes in the level of taxation and transactions would have the kind of effect it did a number of years ago when the last big change was made.  We are now in an environment in which rising prices and inflation are an increasingly important issue for us as we form economic policy for next year and beyond.  There is an economic cycle dimension to the Senator's argument that I am sure the Senator understands and that is relevant to the argument he is putting forward.<\/p><p>For those reasons, I am not accepting the recommendations that are being put forward.  The substantive recommendations that have been put forward here relate to the role of REITs and IREFs.  The core contention I am making to the House this evening is we have an active State.  It has never spent more.  That which we must spend more on is how we deliver affordable homes.  There is a role for the private sector in delivering homes and REITs and IREFs tell the rest of the world that we want their savings to play a role in increasing housing supply in Ireland.  It is a difficult argument to make at the moment but not making it and potentially even losing it is a recipe for fewer homes to be built here in the future or asking the State to do even more.  That itself is something we are willing to do, by the level of capital investment we have at the moment but no state can do everything when it comes to meeting the level of housing needs we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#TTTT00400","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I want to shine a light on the actual taxation situation.  In 2019, tax paid by IREFs relative to pre-tax profits was 9.1%.  That was less than the 25% paid by any other landlord or the 12.5% paid by any other company.  Furthermore, as I said, they are entirely exempt from capital gains tax.  We disagree with the Minister on this policy issue.  We believe the tax advantage enjoyed by these funds is pricing struggling homebuyers out of the market and driving up rents.  We also know these funds are, in the vast majority of cases, buying up properties subject to forward purchase agreements and not forward funding agreements, despite the commentary.  These recommendations are calling for reports, as we have done every year.  A report published in February 2019 by the Department of Finance entitled Institutional Investment in the Housing Market noted:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere is a risk that, should BTR investment continue at current growth rates, market forces would over the long-term create socio-economic polarisation in some urban areas.  Under such a scenario average income earners would be priced-out of purchasing or renting from the private market ... <\/blockquote> <p>Is that not exactly what has been happening?  It goes on to state, &quot;there is a risk that at sufficient scale an institutional investor or group of investors could, over time, develop monopolistic or oligopolistic pricing power&quot;.  That is a report by the Minister's own Department.  It is very clear that is exactly what is happening.  The Minister may be of the view the housing policies pursued in government over the past decade has been a roaring success.  I am not.  The power of investment funds within the housing market must be reined in.  This threat has been recognised elsewhere.  The Liberal Party has committed to measures to clamp down on the financialisation of the housing market in Canada.  We have a different view of the success of Government housing policy and its impact on affordability.  All this recommendation is calling for is a report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#VVVV00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":423,"content":"<p>This debate is a valuable one.  What the Minister has just said is in general something with which I can sympathise considerably.  I fully accept that to cut capital gains tax from 40% to 20% in 2002 is possibly different from the scenario the Minister now faces where there is a massive amount of money sloshing around looking for places to land and where inflationary pressures are high.  I am totally conscious of the cyclical and countercyclical implications of changes to capital gains tax.  However, I make the point, which I am glad the Minister accepts, that to have a levy of the rate of 20%, 33% or 40%, as some of the recommendations suggest, does have market implications.  Looking back to what happened when Charlie McCreevy took the bold plunge and said he was going to cut capital gains tax by half, he got a 500% yield.  That cannot be forgotten.  Maybe I am wrong on this but I assume that in the Department of Finance's files there are plenty of advices and memos stating the then Minister should not do this, that we would not get any extra money from it, that we would lose a lot of money and all the rest of it.  In fairness to the very decent civil servants in that Department, that is the way they conservatively think in relation to rate reductions.<\/p> <p>My second point is there really is a danger now that somehow, entirely simplistic snake oil solutions are being sold to the Irish people as to how the home building and housing crisis can be solved.  In that context, I do not believe the present Government understands some of the things it is actually doing.  In 2009 the then Minister, John Gormley, was persuaded by Threshold, a housing charity, to abolish bedsits.  Across Dublin, in areas the Minister represents and in the one where I myself live, between 10,000 and 15,000 dwellings were extinguished by market forces because private landlords could not adapt old houses to the new requirements.  It was well intentioned.  I am not saying this in any way crabbedly about the then Minister.  He was being urged by a charity to improve standards of accommodation.  However, those involved did not look around the corner and see they were bringing about the extinction of an entire category that was the lowest and second-lowest rung of the housing market right across Dublin.  I hope I am not revealing a terrible secret, but I live on Charleston Road in Ranelagh.  Across the road from me is a series of large redbrick houses.  When I originally went to live on Charleston Road, all those houses were divided into bedsits, as far as I could see.  I used to canvas for both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats and knew what it was to go up to the hall door and see a thing that looked like an accordion, given the number of bells on it you could or could not press.  When you went into the hall, because the door was left open, there were bicycles and you had to wander around the inside of the building to see was there anybody on the register still there three or five years later.  By the way, when I was actively politically 15 or 20 years ago at least half of the houses on Palmerston Road in Ranelagh, now one of the wealthiest and most salubrious roads, were divided into bedsits.  We changed things.  To use the phrase the trendies use now, we gentrified Dublin.  We handed over the market forces to those who had the capital to buy those houses and to turn them into trophy homes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We told the private landlords who took their rents from providing for the lowest rung on the rental ladder to get out of the business because they were no longer required.  The moral of that story is one can do the wrong thing for all the right reasons.  One can drive people out of a market and change a market in this way.<\/p><p>I mention that because the Minister referred to Dominick Street.  I was going across from my place in Ranelagh to the Broadstone Luas station in King's Inns recently and saw the development on Dominick Street.  I also saw across the inner city something which was apparent to me when I was Minister for justice, that is, that the area the Minister represents has atrophied rather than prospered in the last 30 years in many respects.  Gentrification is happening by degrees and only a fool would ignore it but north inner-city Dublin is a different world from south inner-city Dublin.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned the role of local authorities in Dominick Street and, God bless them, they are doing some good work there but there is a blight across north inner-city Dublin.  The Minister only has to open his eyes, look around and realise that it and areas of south-west inner-city Dublin are underdeveloped and in trouble, socially and economically.<\/p><p>When I was a colleague of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, in government, it struck me that he did not seem to have a sense of discontent about the state of north inner-city Dublin.  He seemed to like it the way it was.  Perhaps he was wise to do so.  He got an enormous vote out of it.  My view was that from the canal to the Liffey on the north side should be as prosperous and vibrant a property market as from the canal to the Liffey on the south side.<\/p><p>That brings me to the following point, which I would like the Minister to take on board.  He sits at a cabinet where the Department of housing and whatever it is - we will call it the Custom House for short - is represented.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is doing his best to bring new thinking and dynamism to its activities but let it never be forgotten that over the last 20, 25 or 30 years, those in the Department did everything they could to get local authorities out of housing provision.  Any compulsory purchase order, they sat on it.  They did their best to ensure local authorities did not engage in the level of housing provision that happened at the time.  <\/p><p>I will finish on this point.  I know I am straying a tiny bit away----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#VVVV00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Not just straying, but long strayed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#WWWW00200","speaker":"1696"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":426,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is doing a great job in trying to revolutionise that Department but it, through its prefects across local government, has completely misunderstood the capacity under the housing Acts and local government and planning and development Acts to make a difference by acquiring land and helping in the process of redevelopment.  Personnel in the Department just do not do that.  They do not look at ten or 15 acres in Clanbrassil Street or off Dorset Street and say, \"This could be radically different if we were to CPO it\".  They do not think in that way.  This is the big thing about the Custom House which existed when I was Attorney General, when I was Minister for justice and before that.  They think the Constitution somehow prevents them from using redevelopment powers to make a decent city, build more property and take over derelict land.  It is sad how pathetic the implementation of the Derelict Sites Act has been.<\/p> <p>If we want to address the housing crisis in urban Ireland, particularly in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Dublin, I urge the Minister to urge his colleagues in government to read the Constitution.  It allows urban redevelopment and it allows the State to take a lead in this matter, not by doing all the building itself, as the ideologists would ask, but by doing what was done 100 and 200 years ago and saying, \"This area must be redeveloped and this is the plan to which it must be done and these are the powers which we have to secure that\".  If we are dealing with the housing crisis, the time has come for the Government to tell the Custom House to tell local authority management that it has the power to do things.  They can buy all those vacant sites and take them into public ownership.  They did not do it until this Housing Development Agency came into being because they were reluctant to do it.

I will not have papers from my Department being selectively quoted from to make arguments that the Department and I disagree with.  The Senator quotes some points from the paper on institutional investors in the housing market but neglects to quote the conclusions from the paper.  I will only pick one of them, which stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tHowever, the paper acknowledges that such investors do play an increasingly important role in the private ... sector.

If the Senator is going to refer to a paper from my Department, please be aware that I may be aware of the conclusions in it and will make them in debate on these topics.<\/p><p>The Senator again asserts that IRES REIT either pays no tax or a low level of tax.  In 2019, the total amount of tax that IRES REIT paid in Ireland was &euro;71.98 million.  There were issues in respect of taxation of it.  In the years before that, it was lower than it should have been, but due to changes made in the Finance Act by me and my predecessor, the former Minister, Michael Noonan, the level of tax that IRES REIT pays in Ireland has gone up considerably.  The debate about the role of these structures and funds in Ireland comes back to supply.  I know these structures are complex and I know the language about taxable events and withholding tax does not lend itself easily to the kind of debates that we sometimes have in here and in the D&aacute;il.  If we want more homes to be built in Ireland, accompanied by the State directly building more homes itself, savings in our country and elsewhere have a role to play.<\/p><p>We need billions of euro per year of additional investment and more homes being built in our country.  We need billions of euro to meet the needs of tenants who are worried about their rents in the future and of families of young workers who worry that they might not be able to own a home either now or in the years to come, regardless of how hard they work.  To meet their needs, we need the Government to invest more, which is happening, as well as the private sector playing a role to accompany our efforts.  That is what we are doing.  We know how much we have to do and the effect it is having on our society, politics and living standards, but we are determined to make a difference and we will.  What will not make a difference are simplistic arguments that infer that a State in the future will be able to do everything and there is no role at all for the private sector in meeting those needs.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell put forward arguments about the north inner city, which I will briefly address.  I agree with Senator McDowell that Dublin City Council and other local authorities should have done more in recent years to try to meet the housing needs that we are discussing this evening.  I am, however, sympathetic to the executive and the dilemma it faces.  I will give the example of Sean McDermott Street, O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road.  These homes should have been built years ago.  One can look at what happened at O'Devaney Gardens.  I remember being a Senator in this House in 2008.  Residents from O'Devaney Gardens were sitting over in the Visitors Gallery, by the most bizarre and poor of luck, on the day that the project collapsed.  Nearly 15 years after that event, the good news is that homes are being built.  That bad news is that it is years later than it should have been.  We had private accommodation, cost rental, and local authority housing playing a role in it.  There are homes there that we believed it would be appropriate for people to be able to buy if they could afford to.  Nothing happened with the project for years.  It was ground down.  The same thing happened on Oscar Traynor Road.  There is hypocrisy in parties of the left coming in to castigate this Government, which knows what its responsibilities are, for not being able to meet housing needs while fighting the delivery of those homes tooth and nail in local authorities.  For example, on Oscar Traynor Road, hundreds of homes that should now be built are not happening.  It is relevant to where we are with this debate on housing this evening.  This argument has to be made more regularly and with more force than it has been to date.<\/p><p>Regarding the institutional role that the city council can play, one reason that I am so supportive of the Land Development Agency is that we need to assemble land banks within our cities more quickly than we are at the moment, and we need to come up with a new body to do it.  The Land Development Agency will do it.  By doing that, I hope it will encourage local authorities to play a similar role.  The north inner city needs to make much progress.  The next time Senator McDowell is on his way to Broadstone, I suggest that he go a step beyond it, to Grangegorman, to see what is happening there.  A magnificent project has been delivered by the local authority, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Grangegorman Development Agency.  That is the vision for integrated development and proper planning that I want to see replicated all over the country.  There is an extraordinary higher level institution and place of learning that benefits all.  It took a long time to do but that is what can be done and we need to do the same with housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#WWWW01200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639477800,"counter":437,"content":"<p>Recommendation put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639477800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Sections 19 to 22, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1639477800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I move recommendation No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 25, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;Report on Diesel and Kerosene Subsidies<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>23.<\/b>The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act publishing a report outlining the amount of fossil fuel subsidies provided by the State, including subsidies through tax relief or revenue forgone, in respect of  \t(a) Diesel for Agricultural vehicles<br \/><br \/>(b) Diesel for HGVs and other Haulage Vehicles<br \/><br \/>(c) Jet Kerosene.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>This recommendation asks the Minister to produce a report on diesel and kerosene subsidies.  We passed climate action legislation and we know the issue of fossil fuel subsidies has been highlighted internationally as a core concern.  We seek to meet our climate targets.  The Minister has spoken about the urgency of climate change and the centrality of the challenge which we face.  I have supported the increase in carbon pricing.  I do not believe that the basis for it should be any lifestyle measure and I do not think that would be appropriate.  It is the Pigouvian principle, where costs have been externalised and the social, environmental and other costs have been carried by society.  Those costs should be internalised and reflected within the cost of the fuel.  We know the extraordinary costs of fossil fuels.  When it is approached in that way, it is not a matter of rewarding or punishing.  Our goal should and must be to protect those who are most vulnerable and most impacted.  I am not addressing that issue here but wanted to provide it as context.  This is consistent with that position.  Even for those who do not support a carbon tax, I believe that these measures are appropriate.<\/p><p>Carbon pricing has gone up at a household level.  We know that fuel costs are a key issue at a household level.  More will be needed to address fuel and heat poverty going into this winter.  The fossil fuel subsidies that we are making, however, are largely in commercial areas.  That is where the greatest amount of our revenue forgone, tax subsidisation and absorption of externalised costs from the fossil fuel industry can be found.  I have figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, from 2019.  I would of course appreciate if I could access later figures but those are the latest figures I have.  The CSO figures show that indirect subsidies from revenue forgone due to tax abatements on fossil fuels accounted for nearly 90% of a &euro;2.4 billion total.  The single largest area of revenue forgone, through tax subsidisation, is jet kerosene used for domestic, international and commercial aviation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The revenue forgone from this measure in 2019 was &euro;634 million.  Revenue was also forgone through lower excise duty on diesel fuel.  This was estimated at &euro;400 million.  There have been several calls over many years for this measure to be removed, not simply because of the costs in terms of emissions through diesel fuel which we are absorbing, but also because of the additional social costs carried by our health budgets and the nitrous oxide and particulates emanating from diesel fumes, both of which have been shown to be linked to premature death and strokes.<\/p><p>We are subsidising diesel and jet kerosene by extraordinarily large amounts even as we are telling everybody to do better at turning off lights, which is using fuel carefully, and taking all these household measures.  We need to be clear and consistent.  If we are telling people that we are in a point of transition and they need to change how they live and use fuel and to address those issues, we also need to be consistent and ensure we are not subsidising industry to a very large degree and subsidising jet kerosene.  This is not necessarily always jet kerosene.  We have a large private aeroplane leasing industry and there is a subsidisation issue there.<\/p><p>I have seen the recent protests and it seems to be a bit unclear who is leading them.  A group has magically appeared, yet it is not the Irish Road Haulage Association.  I know the pay and conditions of many who work in road haulage are a concern.  That is the issue that needs to be addressed.  I know there was extensive lobbying by the Irish Road Haulage Association.  At one point, there was an invitation to patrons across the Oireachtas to attend an event.  There was lower excise duty on diesel fuel in budget 2020.  I hope the protest is a signal that the Minister is planning to address this subsidisation and remove it.  Perhaps he might clarify that.  I hope this is a last-ditch attempt to stop the Minister doing the right thing in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#XXXX00500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the contribution of the Irish Road Haulage Association to agriculture, industry and businesses.

We all want to see just transition but we must be clear that it relates to supports for those who are impacted when the necessary changes are made.  It is not about delaying changes.

I am committed to coming back to her in the context of the debate.  The high-wealth individuals division is dealing with approximately 2,700 high net worth taxpayers.  This also includes spouses and related entities.  On average, the division carries out between 250 and 300 interventions per annum with settlements in the region of between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million achieved.<\/p> <p>A similar case management approach is taken in Revenue's medium enterprise division, which deals with the tax affairs of individuals with worth of between &euro;10 million and &euro;20 million.

Senator Higgins asked about the impact of the high-wealth individuals division's interventions.  As I said, it is between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Higgins for her acknowledgement of the role of carbon taxation in this debate and her support for that measure.  The rebate scheme for diesel is at a higher level than it has been in recent years but I believe this scheme is worth retaining in recognition of many of the costs and challenges that sector is facing.  I am aware of the calls for me to phase out this scheme immediately.  I do not believe that would be the right thing to do.  What I want to indicate this evening, as I have done before, is to say that over time, we need to look at how we can scale back the scheme.  If we look at many of the challenges the sector is facing at the moment, for example, with regard to Brexit and the fact that the price of its fuel is going up in any event, as has been evident for some time, I believe this particular relief scheme is worth retaining for now given the importance of the sector to the economy.<\/p> <p>It is worth pointing out that the reason some of the protests are taking place at the moment is not a sense that this scheme is too generous.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a fact that many of those who are protesting at the moment do not want me to go ahead with the increase in carbon pricing, or want the diesel rebate scheme to be extended.<\/p><p>On the Senator&rsquo;s point about fuel for the aviation sector, that debate is coming.  However, the Senator will be aware that currently taxation on fuel for international transport is a difficult area for the State to take unilateral action.  It needs to be done in conjunction with other colleagues within the European Union.  Currently, Ireland is engaging with the European Commission in regard to its proposal on revising the energy taxation directive to take greater account of environmental concerns and the taxation of energy products.  I believe there is a debate approaching on the taxation of the aviation sector.  It is not a change that Ireland could bring about on its own.  I have to say that I would be cautious about change in that area at moment.  We are an island economy, and we depend greatly on access in and out of our country.  I do not want to do anything that would jeopardise that access or undermine what is an important part of our economy.<\/p><p>We are doing something that few governments are in a position to do at the moment, and that is to make credible commitments to change the taxation on carbon in each budget.  Budget 2022 was the third budget in which we have done this.  That is an important way we could change the use of carbon in the future.  For those reasons, and while I thank the Senator for the support she has offered for the changes we are making on carbon taxation, I am not in a position to accept the report that she is proposing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#YYYY00600","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>To be clear, it is not so much that I support these changes; it is just that I regard the cost of carbon as being high.  I regard also that it is closer to an accurate reflection of those costs.  It will be extremely hard to sustain.  I am aware that climate change will have an extraordinarily negative and inequitable impact.  On climate action, we should be taking every measure we can to ensure it does not have an inequitable impact.  It is not so much that I support this, although, in a way, I have supported the fact the price better needs to reflect the costs.  I would be clear that I think this is dangerous.  Everybody has costs and challenges.  Every household has costs and challenges.  Some households coming out of this pandemic face exceptional costs and challenges.  I am concerned precisely because I believe we need to have more accurate carbon pricing.  The price of fuels just cannot go down and they cannot be subsidised further, as they have been for a long period of time.  We have to have more genuinely reflective pricing on the cost of fossil fuels.<\/p> <p>I am concerned that an unnecessary divide and political tension will be created if people consider that sectors, such as aviation, haulage and others, are targeted.  Of course, there are difficulties with Brexit, but there are also opportunities coming through the haulage sector.  We have more roll-on roll-off going directly from Ireland to the Continent and other places than before.  I am concerned that people might think it is only hitting them and that it is not consistent and that there are not measures.  I am also concerned that the words \"over time\" are a little vague.  There should be a signal.  Will there be a plan in the next budget, or will it be the budget after that, to end the diesel rebate scheme?  Until there is a timeline on that, we will not see the kind of shift we need away from heavy diesel vehicles to those that run on alternative fuels.<\/p> <p>We are talking about large amounts of money - &euro;400 million on diesel fuel and &euro;634 million on jet kerosene in 2019, as the Minister acknowledged.  The amount in respect of diesel fuel has gone up since then.  While I do not necessarily want it taken away from that sector, I would like to see that same amount of money re-routed towards pressing for entire fleet changes, for example.  Otherwise, it will be there every single year.  I would prefer that we would have front-loaded investments that encourage a transition and a major shift and a change in the haulage sector as well as a hard timeline, so that the sector knows that if it does not seize the opportunity to make the changes now, it will not be continuously underwritten.  We should bear in mind that this tax subsidy is paid for by tax.  Those who are paying carbon taxes in their households, and who are also paying income taxes, are indirectly subsidising diesel for this industry.<\/p> <p>I understand that the Minister is saying it needs to come and that it will come.  However, we need to be much clearer and more urgent in our action on this.  I hope that next year we do not see the same diesel rebate scheme rolling on again, along with a general aspiration that the sector will change.  Next year, if money is to go into this sector, let it go towards an exit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#ZZZZ00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>While I understand Senator Higgins&rsquo;s passion, as well as what she said, we have to deal with reality as well.

While any business sector may change, finances might change, and our entire fiscal and monetary structures may change, there is one thing that is not negotiable.

Effectively, going into the future, our economic planning, our models, our expenditures, our systems and our business models will need to sit inside our planetary boundaries.  The planetary boundaries cannot be adjusted to suit the realities or even the accustomed realities of economic practice.  I do not say that to be insensitive or to say that those issues are not important.  However, we do a disservice to anything and any area if we do not acknowledge the hard reality of planetary boundaries and of emissions levels.  For example, in the area of jet kerosene, emissions trading schemes mean that many of the emissions from the aviation sector are not captured in our carbon budgets.  However, we have a responsibility if we effectively subsidise that sector to a large degree and are part of a large part of aviation.  Of course we need to have a sustainable aviation industry, to a degree.  We need to look to that, but we also need to be realistic.  We cannot rewrite the facts on emissions.

I am keen to get to some of our later recommendations, particularly those relating to the gender equality-proofing of our private pension tax relief systems.  This is similar to a recommendation I proposed last year.  The former Minister, Brian Lenihan, previously placed a constraint on the amount of profit that could be eligible for exemption under the deferred tax assets scheme.  I understand that how the scheme intersects with the banks is complicated.  There is a role for the deferred tax assets scheme for businesses that have had a difficult period.  However, when these institutions are restored to profit, the writing off of former losses should be a 50-50 measure.  It would be reasonable for 50% of profits to be exempted and 50% to be eligible for taxation by the State, thus contributing to the State.  Many of the banks have benefited significantly not just from the credit guarantee in 2012 but also from smaller credit guarantee schemes such as the one in 2020.  I ask that the Minister prepare a report looking at what the policy options are to restrict banks from carrying forward losses against the taxability of their current profits, specifically banking profits arising from loans that have been guaranteed by the Minister under the credit guarantee scheme.  In the case of those loans, no more than 50% of profits should be eligible for exemption.<\/p><p>I am looking at the time.

Recommendation No. 12 calls for a report on restricting banks that were bailed out by the taxpayer from carrying forward losses against taxable profits in a manner that has previously resulted in many of them paying no corporation tax whatsoever.  The report would also examine the introduction of a 25% cap on profits that could be written off by carried forward losses in any given year and the introduction of a ten-year limit on the use of losses for this purpose.  As we enter a new phase of the pandemic, banks are returning to profitability.  Indeed, the two largest banks in the sector, namely, AIB and Bank of Ireland, are increasing in scale due to the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank from the market, and as a result of recent acquisitions they have made.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, Fine Gael changed the law in 2014 to remove the cap and allow bailed out banks to use 100% of the losses they incurred in previous years to offset future profits.  Up until this change, these banks could only offset 50% of their prior losses against profits in any given year.  We are unique in having neither a time limit nor a cap on losses that can be carried forward to write off against profits, though I would argue that we are the country where such restrictions are most justified.  The proposal is that the banks bailed out by the taxpayer should be required pay corporation tax, and this recommendation calls for a report in order to scrutinise this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#BBBBB02200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Senators may recall that in 2018 my Department produced a detailed technical note for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the subject of both bank losses and corporation tax losses more generally.  This technical note was published online and is still available.  The technical note considered in some detail the potential implications of restricting the use of losses carried forward, or the introduction of a specific time limit or sunset clause on loss relief, for Irish banks, for the wider banking sector, or for the corporate sector as a whole.  Among other considerations, it examined the possible effect of such a restriction on consumers, with the probability that an increased cost base for the banks would be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher fees, higher interest rates on loans or lower deposit rates.  The report noted potential negative consequences for the valuation of the State&rsquo;s banking investments and for capital levels in the banks with possible resulting regulatory impacts.  It also considered potential effects on competition within the banking sector in Ireland, a factor of increasing relevance as banks have since left the Irish market.<\/p> <p>Taking all these factors into account, it is my view that it would be detrimental to Irish consumers and taxpayers if a restriction were to be placed on the use of losses carried forward by the banks.  Notwithstanding the trading losses forward, the Irish banks have been paying corporation tax in recent years, as the tax losses forward are restricted in their use and do not shelter profits made in all their corporate entities.  However, I would also note that as the three pillar banks each posted losses in their 2020 financial statements as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is likely that limited corporate tax liabilities would have arisen for 2020 regardless of any offset of the banks&rsquo; historical losses.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins, in her recommendation, refers to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  The 2012 Act was most recently amended in 2020 to provide for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, a measure within the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This scheme facilitates up to &euro;2 billion in lending to eligible businesses that have been negatively impacted as a result of Covid-19 in Ireland.  The scheme offers a partial Government guarantee of 80% to participating finance providers against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs and primary producers.  The key purpose of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is to support SMEs by improving their access to finance during these difficult times, and any further conditionality attached to the scheme could undermine this important objective.  Given the level of analysis that has already been published, a further report on the matter is not merited.  Therefore, I cannot accept the proposed recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#CCCCC00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":501,"content":"<p>This would only be for such loans that have been profitable.  The concern is that we underwrite the risk and then we do not take the share of the profits.  I understand some of the arguments on the underwriting of risk.  For example, I did not oppose the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act 2020 in that sense but where the risk is being effectively underwritten by the State and there is profit then we cannot have the situation where we do not share any part of that profit.  It is unfair and it is a poor agreement and situation.  I am concerned that sometimes we pour a lot of public money into banks and into underwriting their risks, while not asking them to contribute where they are making profits.  The thing with all these measures, be it the 50% I propose or the 25% proposed by Senator Gavan, is that it only applies where there are profits.  If there is a bad year and there are no profits then it does not kick in but it applies where there are profits, which is important because we are still substantially de-risking what the banks are doing.  However, we are cutting ourselves off from any benefits from that.  It is a poor deal.<\/p> <p>For example, the recovery and resilience fund is coming from the European Union for Ireland to be used in our recovery and resilience and in our climate resilience.  We received &euro;49 million for retrofitting which could have been used to expedite retrofitting.  I know there are other good retrofitting schemes but it could have increased those schemes and helped our schools, for example, including those that have been most impacted by the heightened price of fuel.  Instead we put &euro;49 million into the banks to de-risk them giving loans for retrofitting.  We might say that the banks will give larger loans, which is great and we have mobilised that finance.  Every business in Ireland takes risks and gains profits but we underwrite the risks for banks and they do not share the profits.  It is unfair to other businesses that take risks and pay tax on their profits that we have banks that are getting their risks underwritten by the State and that are not delivering in profits.   The banks should be lending for retrofitting and we should not have to underwrite them to do that; we should be encouraging them to do it.  The State had &euro;49 million of public money that it could have directly used for retrofitting and instead it went to the banks which do not pay tax on their profits.  That is frustrating.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that we are in a vulnerable situation and it is regrettable that as KBC and Ulster Bank leave the market they are not paying the levy next year.  That is a poor decision.  This is a wider issue that we cannot address here but the Minister will be aware that we are developing banking reports within the membership of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  It is a poor decision that has resulted in this situation where we are overly dependent on a narrowing banking system and where we do not have enough actors in that sector.  We need to have proper and responsible policies in this area.  I am concerned that we are continuing to write off profits and to double down on the de-risking of financialised solutions in the area of climate, much as we de-risked certain financialised activities in other areas such as housing in the past.

She asked about how the State can benefit from the upside.  We are majority shareholders in AIB, we nearly entirely own Permanent TSB, and we are minority shareholders in Bank of Ireland, albeit that is decreasing quickly.  That is how we participate in the upside.  The Senator wants to know how we can benefit from any enhanced profitability those banks can make in the future.  We are majority shareholders in two of the three banks so that is the way we do it.  As those banks become more profitable the value of the banks increases and our shareholding increases so if those banks are in a position to pay dividends in the future if they become more profitable then the State is a large recipient of those dividends.<\/p> <p>The Senator referred to de-risking and she outlined her concerns on that.  De-risking is leading to lending activity happening that in the absence of the State putting in place this guarantee would otherwise not be happening, particularly when it comes to retrofitting and in the role we played in providing credit guarantee schemes during darker moments in the Covid crisis.  I thank the Senator for her support of that scheme in 2020.  As a critical part of the de-risking we do we crowd in private capital and provide funding for different schemes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Multiples of that funding are then lent out because banks are in a position to use the assurances we give to support more credit or investment than they would be able to do in the absence of those assurances.  <\/p><p>I will not let Senator Gavan's assertion about class politics slide.

I want our banking sector to be owned more by the private sector in the future.  The Senator is familiar with company law and the independence of boards.  Is she implying that a shareholder, particularly a Government, would use the shareholding that it has in the banks as a source of leverage against an independently elected board of directors?

By giving workers control, you give control to their communities and their local economies to stimulate community and regional wealth building.

They allow community wealth building that is sustainable.  They perform well at meeting local employment needs and tend to look for local suppliers, thereby rooting business locally and strengthening community economies.  Worker co-operative businesses are more likely to pay the living wage and have lower pay differentials between the top and lowest earner.  They show exemplary degrees of corporate social responsibility and a strong commitment to sustainability.

There have been over 35 price hikes announced by energy suppliers since the start of the year.  In the 12 months to October, energy prices increased by 25%.  The price of electricity and gas increased by 16% and 23%, respectively.  The cost of home heating oil, the main fuel source for home heating in 37% of homes, increased by a staggering 71%.  These prices are expected to rise further.  These households need a helping hand and they need it now.<\/p><p>Across Europe, governments have responded with a range of measures to help households.  This Government has done nothing beyond a modest increase in the fuel  allowance, which is out of reach for the majority of workers and families.  In Spain, VAT on electricity bills was slashed by 11% until the end of the year.  In the Czech Republic, VAT on gas and electricity has been reduced to zero until the end of the year.  In Italy, Prime Minister Mario Draghi launched a package of &euro;3.4 billion to protect households from the energy crisis in October, November and December.  That included slashing VAT on gas by 17%, reducing gas charges at a cost of &euro;480 million, cancelling electricity charges at a cost of &euro;800 million and providing a discount on the price of electricity and gas for low-income households at a cost of &euro;450 million.  In contrast, this Government has done very little.  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called on the Government to stretch every sinew to provide real and immediate relief to low and middle income householders who will struggle to light and heat their homes this winter.<\/p><p>On 13<sup><\/sup>October, the European Commission published its toolbox for action and support to tackle rising energy prices.  It is welcome that action is now being very reluctantly taken by the Government to help alleviate the massive increase in the cost of electricity.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been raising this issue for months now and we have pushed the Government to act, but it should not have taken this long.  People needed help this side of Christmas.  The Government needs to tell us how it will ensure this support is extended to households using prepaid electricity meters.  These households are among the most vulnerable to the skyrocketing cost of living.  The action needed must extend beyond electricity as people are struggling with rising electricity, heating and fuel costs.  There remains more to do, including extending the criteria for fuel allowance and the establishment of a discretionary utility debt fund for those who find themselves struggling with debt this winter season.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#EEEEE01100","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":545,"content":"<p>It is amazing that of the 41 recommendations from the Opposition in relation to this Bill, 36 are about reports and not one of them has sought any amendment to the actual Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#EEEEE01200","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":546,"content":"<p>We cannot do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#EEEEE01300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>It is not allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021121400002#EEEEE01400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1639477800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>It is allowed.

As I have said, I understand that the cost of fuel is increasing, but we need to look to ameliorate the impact of the increase in that cost.  It is important that that be addressed.  An area where it has a particular impact is in regard to persons with a disability.  We will not get to discuss the recommendation in regard to the recently published Indecon report on the cost of disability, which has a number of significant implications in regard to financial policies on issues such as VAT, targeted grants, income supports, fuel and many other areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As we know, fuel poverty has a disproportionate effect on those with a disability who spend more time, on average, at home.
