The Department was allowed to carry &euro;4.1 million over to 2021, to fund capital works, but surrendered almost &euro;119 million at the year end.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure incurred in 2020 was distributed across five output programmes.  The largest area of spending was the children and family support programme, in relation to which expenditure of &euro;876 million was incurred in 2020.  That is up about 5% on 2019.  The bulk of this programme expenditure - 97% - was accounted for by funding of &euro;848 million provided to the Child and Family Agency, better known as Tusla.\u00a0 This included special Covid-related funding of &euro;8 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just under &euro;24\u00a0million was expended under the programme in respect of the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.<\/p> <p>  Programme B comprises funding for a wide range of schemes and programmes to benefit children and young people, including early childhood care and education support, and the national child care scheme.\u00a0 The account records programme spending of &euro;601 million in 2020, including almost &euro;83 million on Covid-related supports.\u00a0 Most of the spending under programme B is channelled to the beneficiaries through Pobal, which acts as a paying agent for the Department under a service level agreement.

The more detailed briefing document, which was supplied in advance of the meeting, sets out the estimated provisions, outturns and variance explanations for each of the subheads, along with further details on specific topics of procurement and international protection.  I hope that will be of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, 2020 was an extraordinary year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  In common with all public bodies, the Department was forced to change the way we delivered services and rethink approaches to sustaining our objectives to enhance the lives of children and young people, adults, families and communities, recognise diversity and promote equality of opportunity.  The year 2020 also saw a significant increase in both the size and responsibilities of the Department.  On the formation of the new Government, it was decided to assign significant additional responsibilities to the former Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These included international protection, equality and disability policies, which transferred in from the Department of Justice as well as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Disability Authority.\u00a0 The transfer brought almost 100 staff members and a substantial increase in funding to the Vote.  Some minor youth justice areas transferred out at this time also to the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>Responsibility for education welfare functions, under Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, transferred to the Department of Education with effect from 1 January 2021<b>.  <\/b>As part of the new disability remit, the transfer of responsibility for specialist community-based disability services from the Department of Health is due to be completed soon, following the recent passage of the relevant legislation and extensive preparatory work by both Departments and the HSE.  This final transfer of functions will bring together key disability policy and service elements and result in a major increase in the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, following the changes announced by the incoming Taoiseach in 2020, the Department retained virtually all of the responsibilities of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as assuming significant additional functions in relation to equality, integration and international protection.  The reconfigured Department therefore closed the year with five programme areas, which encompass child protection and welfare, prevention and early intervention, adoption, family supports, early learning and childcare, youth services and youth justice, as well as equality, integration, international protection and disability policy.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to the Vote, the total provision for 2020 was &euro;1.837 billion.  In terms of overall composition, the majority of this was focused on three areas: Tusla, the Child and Family Agency; early years care and education; and international protection seekers' accommodation.  The current expenditure provision was &euro;1.796 billion, with a further &euro;41 million allocated to capital expenditure.  The net provision was &euro;1 billion when appropriations-in-aid of &euro;36.5 million are taken into account.  The outturn for the Vote was &euro;1.677 billion, with a surplus of &euro;123 million, of which &euro;4.1 million was deferred.  <br\/><br\/>The major factor impacting the level of activities and expenditure in 2020 was the Covid-19 pandemic.  Delayed recruitment, cancelled travel, reduced capital expenditure and service closures impacted on spending on schemes such as early childhood care and education, ECCE, and the access and inclusion model, AIM, as well as on international protection services as a result of slowed migration of international protection seekers.  On the other hand, the response to the pandemic necessitated additional spending allocations to the Child and Family Agency of &euro;8 million and to Covid-related supports for providers in early learning and care and school-age childcare to a value of &euro;109.5 million.  These additional supports were funded from savings realised within the Vote.  <br\/><br\/>The largest savings were realised in two areas, the first being under programme E, international protection seekers' accommodation, which finished the year with a surplus of &euro;17.4 million, or 9% of its 2020 provision.  Some increased costs were incurred in ensuring compliance with public health requirements during the pandemic, offsetting some of the savings.<br\/><br\/>The second area of significant underspend was within the three combined early learning and care subheads in programme B, which incorporates the ECCE and AIM childcare schemes as well as the national childcare scheme.  There was an underspend of &euro;55.6 million or 12% of the &euro;480.8 million in these areas.  The biggest factor was the closure of the national childcare scheme for 12 weeks and the lower than anticipated uptake of the scheme once it reopened, as well as the suspension of the ECCE and AIM schemes.  It should be noted that a large portion of the early learning and care subhead&rsquo;s original provision was reallocated to Covid-related spending in the sector in the form of specific supports<b><i>.  <\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the significant efforts of staff across the Department, our agencies and the wider sector in managing the impact of Covid-19 in 2020.  The early learning and care sector and Tusla were particularly impacted in differing ways.  It is to its strong credit that Tusla continued to deliver critical front-line services throughout the pandemic.  In the early learning and care sector, the Department moved quickly to put in place supports to sustain the sector and retain capacity to the greatest extent possible during periods of service closure and reduced demand, working with the sector to ensure sustainability and protect services and service affordability for parents.  The Department worked closely across Government and with sector representatives to develop and target supports that aligned with wider initiatives such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, along with capital and reopening support packages.  Other areas within the Vote also responded to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic, including international protection, youth justice and youth services.<br\/><br\/>As we emerge from these pandemic-related challenges, the Department faces new challenges that are again unprecedented in nature and scale.  I refer to the effects of the war in Ukraine, which has precipitated a humanitarian crisis and impacted enormously on the work of the Department over the past three months through our efforts to provide safe shelter and accommodation to those who have come here in crisis in their many thousands under the EU&rsquo;s temporary protection directive.  The responsibility for making immediate accommodation arrangements for those seeking it falls to our Department under our international protection responsibilities.  <br\/><br\/>We are happy to play our part in meeting the needs of displaced Ukrainians seeking asylum.  The increased scale, pace and unpredictability of demand for accommodation has posed major challenges which continue to be managed on a daily basis.  As of 31 May, 23,894 beneficiaries of temporary protection have sought accommodation through our service.  All available avenues of additional short-term accommodation have been and are being explored in seeking to increase available capacity to meet this demand.  We have had to move quickly to build internal teams to manage the response in all of its aspects, through reassigning staff from other roles and bringing in additional support where we can.  We have relied heavily on the support of local authorities in meeting immediate emergency accommodation needs as they arise and taken all necessary urgent actions to ensure that the daily requirements of managing the unprecedented inflow of people involved can be met.  We will continue to seek to respond to this crisis as it evolves over the coming weeks and months and this will have a significant impact on costs in the Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and beyond.  <br\/><br\/>I pay tribute to my colleagues in the Department for their response to the huge demands of the current crisis and for the wider contributions they have made in continuing to deliver on a range of objectives since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention and am happy to take questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

With significant responsibility in the transfer of community-based disability services, the Department will get even busier.  There is a lot happening and that is to be appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on the opening comments from the Comptroller and Auditor General which drew attention to the disclosure from the Accounting Officer around the non-compliance with procurement rules in relation to international protection accommodation services, IPAS.  He spoke about the vast majority of non-compliance procurement, over 87%, in 2022 relating to IPAS centres and emergency accommodation.

His opening comments are appreciated.  On the non-compliant expenditure identified in the 2020 accounts, it is important to acknowledge the context whereby, in providing accommodation for international protection seekers, the Department meets an unpredictable level or scale of demand.  It is demand-led and a real-time response is required.  The system tends to come under continual pressure and in 2020 there was a context involving Covid and the requirements of public health compliance which involved having to thin out the accommodation numbers in any congregated setting.  That put pressure on the emergency response at that time.<\/p> <p>  The previous Department, in seeking to provide for international protection accommodation, ran a number of regional tendering competitions between 2018 and 2021.<\/p><p>At a point in time, it became clear that that was not going to meet the requirements of the demand that was presenting and expressions of interest were sought through national and local newspapers to try to bring additional accommodation on stream as it was required.  There was a competitive element to that but, when the functions transferred in, the view was taken by our own procurement team that while much of the accommodation was procured competitively, it was not compliant with the regulations and, therefore, should have been noted in the circular 40\/02 return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr.  Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>With regard to the 151 contracts in 2020, have new competitions been extended out or has there been a request for tender, RFT, for these current contracts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#C00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654158600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>What has happened since is that a large-scale request for tender was published on 18 January of this year, with a closing date of 21 February.  A compliance check process on the responses that were received had commenced on 28 February.  That was paused when the Ukraine crisis broke as we had to divert staff resources to meet the immediate need of the Ukraine crisis.  We have since been in a position to recommence the compliance checks as part of that RFT so we will see additional accommodation coming on stream on foot of that.  Although I am not in a position to say, I would expect that some of the contracts that were placed in 2020 and 2021 will be regularised through that process.<\/p> <p>  It is important to also say that overall demand for international protection has been growing hugely.  We have seen 4,500 people seeking international protection so far this year.  The context is that our projections for this year would have been 3,500 for the full year and we have seen 4,500 to date, so the numbers are increasing very significantly, which is going to continue to put us under pressure in terms of an emergency response.<\/p> <p>  The original intention in running the RFT was to try to move away from our reliance on emergency accommodation and emergency centres and, as the Deputy will be aware, there is a White Paper for transitioning out of the model of direct provision that operates at the moment and an implementation plan has been in development around that.  The ultimate aim is to move to a different model and a different system of accommodating international protection seekers that would see them received in reception centres, moving on to phase 1 accommodation for a period and then moving on to a different type of accommodation in phase 2 beyond that.  The intention would be that all of that would be procured through normal, required procurement channels but, as I said, at the moment our overall capacity to respond is coming under pressure, not simply because of the Ukraine response, but also the international protection numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>In terms of non-competitive procurement for 2021, does Mr. McCarthy feel the Department has decreased or increased the &euro;91 million figure that was there for 2020?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#C00400","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654158600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>There is a lower number of contracts in 2021, that is, 54 contracts rather than 151, but of a similar value, so it will be up around the &euro;90 million mark again for 2021.

We have a large number of very small operators, many of them with great passion and commitment.  However, in many cases the current model of pay per child per use does not do anything to help them meet the capital costs of providing that service.

It shows, however, that the only logical way forward is for us to move towards a system whereby the State largely funds childcare in a more direct way and with more control over governance.  A total of 14% of contracts under ECCE were identified as being non-compliant, but I have concerns about whether that phrase is even appropriate in this context.  These are very small operations in some cases, and we are holding them to account for being non-compliant when the Department itself is struggling with non-compliant procurement.

There is quite a high bar for compliance because in the inspection regime, depending on the scheme, there could be anything from 28 to 44, and beyond, compliance checks.  Where a provider is found to be non-compliant on a small number of those, it is deemed to be non-compliant.  The compliance regime is very much about trying to support providers in identifying where they are not compliant and to rectify that and take actions to get to a level of compliance.  Sanctions do not kick in until successive non-compliance is found through successive inspections.  There are a number of means through which those providers that are found to be non-compliant can be supported through support funding and so on to help them to address the findings that are identified.<\/p> <p>  The intention, which is very much underpinned by the new model, relates to a public private partnership and to the State becoming much more involved as a co-founder of activity in the sector, in return for which providers sign up to fee arrangements that involve no increase in fees for parents and, ultimately, reductions in fees for parents.  It is about trying to move what has historically been a very independent sector into being a publicly funded and publicly supported model of provision, recognising the vital importance of early years education and care for the development of children and the State's absolute responsibility to ensure that is funded, supported and overseen in terms of quality.  The compliance aspect is important in providing parents with the assurance that the quality of provision their child is getting in a given setting is tested and benchmarked against expected standards and that the provider is supported in achieving those standards where it is falling short, for whatever reason.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct.

Sometimes that involves camp beds in community halls or other congregated types of settings, which are not of a standard that we would want to be providing to people and are not sustainable in terms of offering anything more than immediate accommodation on arrival, but there would obviously be a requirement for fire safety standards to be met as a minimum.  Local authorities would inspect any premises that are in use, if there was any concern around the standard of what is on offer.  However, it is the case that while we endeavour to secure and provide the best accommodation that is available to us, we have been securing accommodation that would be of a standard that, overall, we would not wish to be putting people into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>What would Mr. McCarthy's views be on a development in County Meath of between 500 and 600 units by two organisations with regard to provision of accommodation for Ukrainian refugees?

Obviously, the most important aspect of foster care is that it meets the best interests of the child.  However, there are different costs depending on what is available, and whether it is with a family member, a foster parent or a private provider.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question some time ago in relation to the number on the panel and the number of children.  In some locations, there is a clear shortage of foster parents.  Is that the determining factor?  I imagine that there is specialised care required for some children, but what would be the determining factor?  What involvement would the Department have in that general policy in placing children or in deciding?

Tusla is developing a new foster care strategy that it plans to bring to its board in July.  In advance of that, it has produced a proposal on foster care rates which is with us now.  We are engaging with them on that.   Obviously, there are budgetary implications to any change on that and we need to reside any proposal for change as part of an overall strategy for supporting foster care.  We absolutely recognise the importance and value of foster care.  Some 90% of children in care are in foster care.  It is a means of supporting children in need that we are absolutely reliant on as a State and it is entirely appropriate that we would support foster carers appropriately.

Frankly, having to wait for another review and another report in a situation where we now face record levels of inflation is of huge concern.  It is a point that has been made repeatedly by different organisations that have come to my office.  I know it is an issue throughout the country.  There are families who are to the pins of their collars.  We have to deal with this problem up-front and come up with a plan rather than waiting for another budgetary cycle to see what the Department may or may not do.  If there is a surplus coming in to 2022, and I hope that there will not be a surplus for the accounts in 2021, that there is some focus on that area.<\/p> <p>  I understand that of the Department's funding streams available to youth organisations and youth clubs, much is devolved into local organisations.

I want to make the point that the surplus that arose in 2020 was very much a one-off in the context of the impact of Covid on a range of activities across the Department's Vote.  We sought to reuse funding to the best extend possible through putting a range of additional Covid supports in place to sustain in particular the early years sector where the viability and survival of providers would have been at risk if we were not in a position to do that as a result of the fall-off in service demand.  All that was a one-off.  I would not expect to see surpluses of that scale materialise in subsequent years.  It would not be an option to divert what was a one-off saving in a particular year into a base-level adjustment.  Something like changing rates of payment for foster carers would be a permanent change of your cost base.  It obviously has to be negotiated and agreed through the normal budgetary cycle.<\/p> <p>  On youth services, we have a lot of interaction with the education and training boards which oversee the delivery of youth services funding on behalf of the Department.

I come from Youghal.  That is one of the areas I, as a Deputy, represent.  I do not mean to be parochial but I want to use it as a good example.  We find it very challenging to get funding down from the ETB to support programmes that are put in place through Departmental funding.  Cork is a huge county.  There is a city and county with a very large geographical area and different needs.  There is an inner city through the local authority, Cork City Council, and there is a lot of social deprivation and many different issues that require huge State investment to try to improve.<\/p><p>However, there are also many rural towns where further investment needs to be put in for the benefit of children who come from backgrounds where, unfortunately, there are significant problems.  Such children need additional support.  That is something I want to highlight.  With regard to rural towns, particularly those sharing with city centres, the Department is devolving funding to organisations but it is not reaching where it is needed.  There is not a fair and equitable balance in the devolution of that funding.  I have come across this on more than one occasion and, quite frankly, I am sick of it.  It is not fair.  It is particularly not fair on rural constituencies in counties like Cork where there are significant major settlements like Cork city that have their own needs.  They need to be separated out from an education and training board, ETB, point of view when it comes to the provision of funds for very worthy projects.  I came across this recently with regard to the Garda youth diversion projects.  We raised the matter at a ministerial level but were unsuccessful.  That is really disappointing.  More has to be done on policing.  I will ask the question again.

We should ask the Secretary General to clarify his own views on the matter and we should ask for an apology to members of the committee if it did happen.  It is totally unacceptable.  The Oireachtas is the body held accountable by the public and all Departments are answerable to the Oireachtas and to the duly elected government.  We do not know for sure whether the comments were made but they have certainly been reported as direct speech.  I propose we ask for the Department of Health&rsquo;s view on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#CC01400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>This is not the first time some derogatory remarks have been made about the committee in general.

Horse Sport Ireland has 24 affiliates ranging from pony clubs to Olympic-level organisations.  There is a real mix there and getting one facility that caters for all of their needs is difficult.  In case people think I know what I am talking about, I must say that other people have told me this.  Essentially, Horse Sport Ireland gets the bulk of its funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with &euro;6 out of every &euro;7 coming from that source.  Horse Sport Ireland wanted to get a permanent facility and that is fine.  It then had to decide where to locate it, with a view to meeting the needs of all of its affiliates.  However, none of the affiliates was consulted in advance and some of them have real issues with the decision of Horse Sport Ireland.  The site chosen is located in an industrial estate in west Dublin and it simply will not meet the needs of some of the affiliates.  It is a 30 acre site and some of the land has been sterilised or frozen from further development because part of it will be needed for the extension of the link to the N3, N4 and N7.  This roads objective could be problematic and may mean that it will not be possible to expand the site into the future in one particular direction.  Furthermore, the current planning permission has restrictions attached, including that the facility must be for private use.  It expressly prohibits competition or other commercial activities.

If public money is going to be spent, can the facility actually function and meet their requirements?  Can it expand in the future?  It is a lease as opposed to a purchase and I think there are questions to be answered.  Public money is being spent.  Horse Sport Ireland receives quite a bit of funding from the Department and I would have thought that there should have been a high level of engagement with the affiliates on this.  I do not know where this is at right now but wish to draw attention to it.  I have also done that in the D&aacute;il by way of a Topical Issue and have raised it with the Department.  I am unhappy with the Department's stand-off approach to some of the organisations it funds.  The Department tells us that the organisations are independent and while we do not want to see the Minister getting involved in the day-to-day running of an organisation, some level of oversight in the context of the spending of public money is required.

It is from an individual who has corresponded with the committee regarding social welfare appeals.  The correspondent asks if the committee has found evidence of test cases being used by the social welfare appeals office and the Department.  It is proposed to provide the correspondent with a copy of our report on the examination of the 2019 Appropriation Account for Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  That report records our position on the matter arising from the evidence that was presented to us.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  In the report it is set out clearly that there was evidence of test cases being used at some level.<\/p><p>It is to be hoped that will clarify the matter for the respondent.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 1261 is from Atheist Ireland, dated 24 May 2022.  On receipt of previous correspondence from Atheist Ireland concerning the constitutional provisions regarding education, the committee sought responses from the Department of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The Department advised that it intended to meet with Atheist Ireland to discuss the issues and we forwarded the responses from it and the NCCA.  The meeting has now taken place and Atheist Ireland states that the Department has undertaken to reflect on the views of Atheist Ireland and acknowledges that the Department is acting in good faith.  That is good.  Essentially, Atheist Ireland takes issue with the Department of Education&rsquo;s funding of schools that, in its view, do not abide by the constitutional conditions for that funding.  Atheist Ireland requests that the committee examine the matter.  It is clear there is ongoing engagement between the Department and Atheist Ireland.  It is also clear that the matter turns on constitutional interpretation and it is not the role of the committee to adjudicate on that interpretation.  The policy that flows from such interpretation is not a matter for the committee either and would be more appropriate to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is proposed to advise Atheist Ireland accordingly.  Does any member wish to address this item of correspondence?  Members are happy enough with it.<\/p><p> I will move on to the work programme.

I welcome the Commissioner to the committee.  Her officials are here with her.  On behalf of the committee I thank the Commissioner for taking the time to meet with the committee during her visit.  This is an important opportunity to meet with Commissioner Simson and her colleagues.  The committee is looking forward to a productive discussion on a wide range of energy-related matters, particularly energy security and decarbonisation pathways for the energy sector in Ireland and in the EU in the context of the war in Ukraine and in the context of the climate emergency.  We will also discuss the need to develop and expand alternatives to fossil fuels as we strive to reduce emissions and move to a cleaner and greener economy and society.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, as usual I will read out the note on privilege.

I understand the need to give the committee first-hand information on what we are doing at Brussels level.  As every member state is unique and the energy mix in each and every member state is different, this is also necessary for me and my colleagues to hear from the committee members what are their national challenges and expectations.  I will make some introductory remarks and I hope the committee members will have comments and questions.<\/p> <p>  When I think of Irish energy pioneers, John Tyndall comes to mind.  He was the first scientist said to have discovered the greenhouse effect, and one of the most important factors driving our energy policy action in the EU today is greenhouse gas emissions.  He was one but, of course, not the only one.  I want to talk about this matter among others today.<\/p> <p>  Right now, there is a dilemma at the heart of EU energy policy.  First, there is a changing climate.  They say that last year might have been one of the hottest on record but, instead, one should consider that it might be also one of the coolest for the next 100 years.  Second, there are changes in wholesale energy prices.  The committee members are well aware of this because Ireland's electricity prices are higher than the EU average.  Third, there is the war in Ukraine.  This is a reality that is causing us to reconsider Europe's energy security.<\/p> <p>  Let me focus on this last issue for a moment.  The war in Ukraine has changed things when it comes to energy.  We are focused to confront the fact that we are too dependent on imports from Russia.  Energy is being used as a tool for blackmail and this is something that we cannot tolerate.  The committee will be aware that so far, since the war broke out, we have proposed already six sets of sanctions against Russia.  The first set of sanctions targeted technology that they need for their refineries and drilling.  The fifth set of sanctions covered coal imports and the last one is about oil.<\/p> <p>  We have to also think in the longer term about our relationship.  We cannot justify our dependence on Russian fossil fuels.  We have agreed to remove all of them from our system as soon as possible.  We were prepared for that because we are on the road to a climate-neutral Europe with the European Green Deal.  Last year, we proposed our Fit for 55 package.  A year later, the reality has changed and we need to go one step further and faster.  This is why we brought forward the REPowerEU package last month.  This is our plan to get rid of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible.  That means we will move further and faster in every aspect of the Fit for 55 package, we will diversify our gas supplies, we will ramp up renewables and we are going even further with energy savings.  Without the latter, it is impossible to get rid of Russian imports in the short term.<\/p> <p>  All this will not be easy because doubling down even further will take a commitment and effort across society, including addressing the main obstacles holding us back.<\/p><p>The details have to be in place.  The first thing proposed is that we have to increase the renewable share in our energy mix.  By 2030, it has to reach 45%.  It is difficult because there are challenges in building new renewable parks.  The biggest bottleneck is permitting so we have to shorten this.   Right now, we are looking at timeline of up to a decade for offshore projects.  It is time we do not have now.  We are also proposing a massive solar PV deployment via the European solar rooftop initiative.  To underpin this, we wish to amend the energy performance of buildings directive to make solar panels on the rooftops for newly built buildings mandatory.  We have to, of course, ensure there is a skilled workforce available and also manufacturing here in Europe.  We plan to set up an EU large-scale skills partnership as well as a European PV solar industry alliance, so that we do not create new dependence on imported solar panels from China.<\/p><p> We cannot replace Russian imports with our own alternatives supplies.  We have to replace Russian imports with renewables and savings.  We also need to diversify our supply routes and that means securing around 50 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas, LNG, and an additional 10 billion cubic metres of pipeline gas from non-Russian sources.  This is ongoing work.  We have been contacting all the major reliable partners across the globe but mainly in our closest neighbourhood.  We are planning to aggregate EU demand so that we can negotiate the price with these suppliers.  The next step will be a joint purchasing mechanism that member states can participate in.  They will then receive cheaper shipments if we are successful.  We are planning to build long-term partnerships at first for LNG, but in the long run for renewable hydrogen.<\/p><p> We are also making suggestions to member states as to what they can do before this winter approaches.  Members have probably seen our toolbox.  This also includes short-term measures from taxing windfall profits to using regulated prices for most vulnerable consumers.  These are the main points in this package.<\/p><p> I would like to add that the strength Ireland has is that it has huge opportunity to offer on renewables.  The national energy climate plan is ambitious if we compare it with other member states.  The proposal set out in Ireland's climate action plan shows confidence in the potential on this island.  I am going to visit the green energy projects in the midlands tomorrow.  There are few places in the world that are better suited to offshore renewables than Ireland.  Sitting on the edge of the windy Atlantic gives Ireland great potential to produce more renewable electricity.  From our side, I believe our guidance on permitting gives Ireland an opportunity to boost the domestic industry massively.  This has potential for job creation in communities all along the Wild Atlantic Way as well as around the country.<\/p><p> I also want to mention retrofitting because there are some sectors where savings are relatively easy to achieve.  Energy efficiency is one of those and retrofitting Ireland's building stock will immediately cut its omissions and ease the pressure on the environment and reduce the need for energy.  It also makes a just transition possible as increasing our efficiency allows us to offer the final consumers more affordable energy bills.  It helps us to tackle energy poverty at its cause.  Again, ambitions are high here.  The plan aims to retrofit more than 1 million homes by the end of the decade and to install more than half a million heat pumps.  We will help from our side with legislative proposals.  I think that European energy performance of building directive is most useful here.<\/p><p> The three main issues that dominate our landscape right now are sustainability, affordability and security.  Ireland is among the ambitious member states.  There are very difficult negotiations ahead at Council level because, as I mentioned, we are proposing that member states agree to cover 45% of our energy consumption with renewables by 2030.  If we keep in mind that the existing target is only 32%, then this is a major achievement that will not be achieved without member states agreeing on it.<\/p><p> From our side, there are some additional new funds that Ireland can use.  Private investors are willing to invest.  Consumers see that when they have a chance to use renewables in these regions, prices are more affordable.  The biggest bottleneck is permitting and we do not have a decade to waste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kadri Simson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Commissioner Simson, for those opening remarks.  This will be a short engagement as we have until 3.45 p.m.  I propose that each member takes just two minutes to address their questions to the Commissioner to ensure every member gets an opportunity to do that.<\/p> <p>  Commissioner, you touched on many of the areas I was interested in raising with you, but we might go into those a little more.  You are absolutely correct in saying that every member state is unique.  Given the vast resources in Ireland, we would say we are in a particularly good position, certainly when compared to other member states.  The conversation here has changed significantly in the last few years.  We are starting to realise that we can use the resources we have, not only to decarbonise our own country, but to help Europe decarbonise as well.  This committee is very engaged and we have had very significant public sessions recently.  We hope to publish a report very soon on the larger opportunity.  We talk not about the 5 GW but about the 50 GW, which is off the south and west coast of Ireland, and how we realise that.  To realise that, we need to ramp up the scale of development enormously.  This is a scale that is hard to imagine but can be done.  We need to develop further interconnection with Europe and to be able to transfer that power from this island directly to the European Continent.<\/p> <p>  My fundamental question is on how the Commission and Europe can help Ireland to, in turn, help Europe.  This is a very new conversation and with the war in Ukraine, everybody is thinking about it now.  I think the penny is dropping in this country that we can really help Europe.  I hope that this is understood across the member states and in the Commission.<\/p> <p>  With respect to hydrogen, we talk about green hydrogen here.  We do not talk about low-carbon hydrogen because we have that vast renewable energy resource.  It will be with renewable electricity, through electrolysis, that hydrogen would be generated.<\/p><p>It would then become a storage medium for generation and, perhaps, industry and transport.  There are risks with green hydrogen.  We have a significant concern that hydrogen, when it is blended with natural gas, could, in effect, lock in natural gas for decades to come.  That is not what we want to happen.  We want to go to 100% hydrogen so that it is a quicker decarbonisation path than anybody envisaged before.  Recognising that Ireland has that unique renewable resource, the fundamental question is how the Commission can help us to realise it because that, in turn, will help Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#C00200","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for his question.  In the medium term, we see that it is possible to replace Russian imports with diversifying supplies but, in the main, we have to replace Russian fossil fuels with home-grown renewables.  We can replace natural gas with clean gases.  We will ask our member states to promote biomethane production, for example, because it is something that might give us additional alternatives.  It could provide 35 billion cu. m of our own gas production.<\/p> <p>  On hydrogen, we will need molecules in some sectors because electrification there is technically impossible and not economically viable.  Last December, the European Commission presented our hydrogen and gas decarbonisation proposal.  With that proposal, we tried to create a well-functioning hydrogen market in Europe.  We will set clear rules and identify what is green hydrogen.  By doing so, we expect that our international partners will also consider that this kind of certification for green hydrogen will be internationally accepted.  There are sectors where green hydrogen in its fullest form is necessary, such as industrial production, as well as some transport modes that are more challenging.  Aviation and maritime shipping come to mind in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Where we can, we will use electricity because promoting electrification helps us to avoid losses.  That is why our REPower EU plan includes an annexe with necessary interconnections and investments.  Members may have noticed there were some oil pipelines.  We had to give alternative supply routes to landlocked countries that currently receive crude oil from Russia.  We absolutely tried to avoid investing EU funds in fossil fuel pipelines.  The need we identified only came to &euro;2 billion.  Then we said we needed an additional &euro;28 billion for electricity interconnections because we should get rid of natural gas from power generation, for example, and, of course, one needs green electricity to replace it.  There are several hours when offshore wind farms, for example, will produce more electricity than the grid consumes and this makes a perfect business case for hydrogen production.  We know that by the end of the decade, European industry will consume more hydrogen than we will be able to produce here, so we set a very ambitious target to produce 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen in Europe and import 10 million tonnes from our neighbours.  One of those neighbours will be Ukraine.  We have committed to help it rebuild its economy.  Instead of being a transit country for Russian oil and gas, it  could be a producer of green electricity and renewable hydrogen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kadri Simson"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Simson and thank for her remarks, particularly as regards the REPower EU plan.

Renovating their home helps final consumers to take responsibility for their heating bills.  It creates local jobs and uses materials that are locally produced and, of course, helps to cut emissions.  Two years on, we see that all the governments are committed to starting renovation activities but there are various bottlenecks, such as finding skilled workers.  With the current high prices, it makes sense to insulate one's home.  People who are living in apartments or houses that are in the lowest performance category of buildings, at F level, have to consume as much as ten times more energy to get to a comfortable temperature than those who live in newly built apartments.  The skills, however, are now the bottleneck.  My colleague, Commissioner Nicolas Schmit, is dedicated to this topic 24-7.  He will present our proposal in this regard.  Although training, including vocational training, is decided at local level, we have to endorse these activities.<\/p><p>On solar strategy, if we want to replace fossil fuel electricity with something else, solar rooftops are an option that do not face strong public opposition.  Solar PVs are coming from third countries so we have to help our industry to build back the production facilities here because the technology was created here.  The industry has innovative solutions and we are trying to tap into those with the help of member states.  State aid may at some stage be required to secure the availability of the necessary raw materials for the production.  We see great potential for solar energy.  Farmers may consider using their land for the production of solar energy and might install solar panels that do not disrupt the production of agricultural products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Kadri Simson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>It is great to see the Commissioner and I thank her for coming.  Will the Commission support Ireland to develop further interconnection infrastructure?  Would that support come from the EU through funding?  The trans-European networks for energy, TEN-E, which has &euro;5 billion, would be a useful source of funding but that is something the Irish Government would have to request.  Would the Commissioner support the Irish Government if it made a request for funding?  I raise the issue because as the Commissioner will know, the Celtic interconnector received planning approval.  However, it will transfer only a very small amount of electricity.  We have so much potential with offshore wind that we can be of real benefit to Europe but we need that funding to provide the infrastructure in the first place.  Will the Commission support the Government on that issue?<\/p> <p>  My next question does not fall exactly within the Commissioner's remit but is connected to it.  It falls more under the remit of Commissioner Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness and relates to the EU's sustainable finance taxonomy policy.  That policy was designed to implement a gold standard of green investing where investments were labelled as climate friendly.  What is the thought process behind the EU labelling nuclear energy climate friendly and a green type of energy?  It is not, to be frank.  It is so slow that it will not help us to reach our 2030 or 2050 targets.  It is not sustainable.  What is the thought process behind considering nuclear energy green and including it in the taxonomy rules in the first instance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#E00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  The answer to his first question is \"Yes\".  We do plan to support member states that are still missing interconnections to the rest of Europe.  The Celtic interconnector is a fine example and the Commission has co-financed the project.  Ireland certainly needs additional interconnections.  We also agreed last December with our co-legislators that we can now use TEN-E funds for financing offshore connections.  Offshore parks are built in the regions where there are no connections and that might be a burden for private promoters.  Countries can apply for co-financing for such projects.  The North Seas Energy Cooperation, NSEC, is in place.  It is a good organisation.  Ireland has the presidency of the platform at the moment.  We are planning a mesh screed at the sea-base level that will help us to upgrade offshore potential, which we strongly support.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about taxonomy and why a second delegate Act covered some natural gas and nuclear investments.  We have never financed nuclear power plants from EU funds.  On the contrary, we have only co-financed three dismantling projects for the old pipes in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that were built decades ago.  Three member states, when they joined in 2004, committed to closing their nuclear facilities.  That is the only financing from the EU that has been used in nuclear sites.  We take care of nuclear safety and half of my directorate is doing dedicated work to keep the standards at the highest level.  We run regular stress tests on nuclear sites.  Despite that, some member states have informed us that they will achieve their climate neutrality targets with the help of nuclear power.  That is their right because according to the treaty, member states can choose their energy mix.  Through the taxonomy delegated Act, we will guide private investors towards these projects that are very restricted and meet the highest available standards.  This is to avoid a situation where those private investors will finance a project that it is not meeting the highest standards.  It is for private investors and, as such, based on the advice of an expert scientific panel, we thought it our duty to guide private financing to limited possible future investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kadri Simson"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>That is excellent.

I welcome RePowerEU and the plan to rapidly reduce the dependence on Russian fossil fuels and fast-forward the green transition.  What does the Commission propose to do to support states and businesses to ramp up the production of low carbon energy products such as solar PV, offshore wind turbines, ships for deploying offshore wind, port investment in places such as Shannon and Kilrush, which are in my own county?  The scale of all European countries' ambitions will only be realised and affordable if supply chains expand rapidly to meet demand.  I know the Commissioner has mentioned she is aware that this must be done.  Having travelled in Ukraine, Moldova and eastern Europe many times for environmental conferences, I think it would be good to see manufacturing being created in those countries which have the workforce and necessary skills.<\/p> <p>  We must see this as an emergency issue because of the war and climate change.  I was involved in organising a protest intended to shut down a nuclear power plant in Sellafield in England and was also involved in starting the campaign to ban fracking in Ireland.  We also have an emergency around where we source our fuels.  We do not want to be stuck in a situation where we have to import fracked gas from anywhere, war or no war.  Unless we understand at an EU level what a climate crisis we are in because of the war and our dependence on fossil fuels, we will be forced to use fuels we do not want to use.  That is true not only of Ireland but also of other countries.  We are in a state of emergency.  The manufacturing of everything we need to switch from fossil fuels must also be seen as an emergency.  During previous wars, when men were out fighting, we got the women into the factories.  That was the case in the 1930s and 1940s.  We must consider this as a similar level of emergency because otherwise we will fail and will be forced to compromise and pay people for fracked gas.  When we do not want it in our country, it is not fair to say that we will take it from other countries.  I feel the same about nuclear power.  We must expedite this and provide financial supports to help countries to do that.  We should manufacture in eastern European countries because the labour force is there.  Otherwise, we are not going to able to transition and will be forced to compromise ourselves.  That is my big concern.  As the European Commissioner for Energy, Ms Simson must grab the bull by the horns, as it were, and consider the situation as a real emergency.  We have seen what is happening with the climate irrespective of the war in Ukraine.  If we do not expedite our response and treat the situation as the number one priority on the agenda of the European Commission, we will fail and will have to compromise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#E00500","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I agree that, after the war ends and Ukraine prevails, we should not return to Europe being so dependent on imported fossil fuels.  We still are, with 97% of our oil consumption made up by imports and 90% of our gas coming from third countries.  If we deliver our REPowerEU plan, we will partially replace fossil fuels with renewables this year and next.  We must do our utmost to achieve our 2030 targets so that 45% of our consumption is covered by renewables, which are home grown and we are not dependent on volatile prices and so on for them.<\/p> <p>  As to where we will get the necessary equipment, European companies still hold the global leadership in offshore wind technology.  The wind turbines are produced in Europe and the vessels necessary to install bottom-fixed turbines offshore are at our disposal.  This gives us a competitive advantage.  Our offshore targets are significantly higher than anyone else's.  If we are talking about 65 GW in the North Sea, it is a significantly higher ambition than is envisaged for all of the US.  When we presented out offshore energy strategy, we also claimed that it wold create jobs, not only in coastal regions where the maintenance of wind farms would offer job opportunities for coastal towns all year around, but also in landlocked countries, given that blades and other components can be produced in Europe.  For regions that will lose mining jobs, for example, we have offered additional financing via our just transition mechanism so that they can attract new, clean industrial job opportunities.<\/p> <p>  Regarding solar PV, the greatest challenge is to secure the necessary components - rare earth minerals.

We have to deliver on all fronts, but we are relatively well prepared.  In Europe, we faced our first gas disruption in 2009.  Member states were not connected to one another via gas pipelines and there were few LNG terminals.  Despite the fact that 40% of the pipeline gas that Europe consumed last year came from Russia, all member states that were customers of Russia's Gazprom had alternatives via reverse flow or because they had access to some LNG terminals.  With the help of ENTSOG, which is a distribution system operator, DSO, organisation, we have prepared a map of missing interconnections or links.  There are very few.<\/p> <p>  Our main challenge is that, if we have to replace 155 billion cu. m. of Russian natural gas, no other producer can provide us that volume.  LNG terminals alone will not do the trick because we would have to find producers that were ready to scale up their production in a relatively short time.  The US has been a great help.  Since the beginning of this year, Russia has cut off several European countries, but they have not seen major disruptions because we have received record volumes of LNG to European LNG terminals each month.  However, this is only possible while the disruptions are partial.  Otherwise, we will have to replace gas with alternatives.  Such alternatives could be clean gas.  Our governments are announcing that they are incentivising farmers to produce biomethane and we already have more green hydrogen projects in the pipeline than we expected a year ago because the people involved can see the market case for such projects, given that natural gas is more expensive.  Many companies that are consuming gas are considering alternatives and are willing to take up hydrogen instead of natural gas.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the Deputy's first question on whether we are giving too much power to gas DSOs.  With our gas decarbonisation and hydrogen package, we have shown that that is not our intent.  We will create a dedicated alternative network for hydrogen that is not controlled by gas pipeline operators.<\/p><p>Our intention is to create a well-functioning market.  This is a very nascent market right now but it will be built up in a transparent way from the beginning.  Unbundling is one of the principles to promote in that regard.<\/p><p> Energy infrastructure is a national decision.  If we build an energy terminal or rent a floating LNG vessel, we are doing our best to attract more volumes for this heating season.  In the longer run, however, if our member states achieve everything proposed under Fit for 55, then by 2030 Europe will consume 30% less natural gas than we consumed in 2020.  This is an extraordinary time and there is major pressure before this heating season but, in the long run, we will decarbonise and replace a significant share of our gas consumption with clean gases or we will start using gas in power generation for fewer hours.  That means our consumption will come down because there will be more and more hours when all our consumption will be covered by renewables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kadri Simson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>What about the lock-in with new fossil fuel infrastructure, especially LNG?

The pipeline that connects them with Russia is now a stranded asset so they have opted for floating regasification vessels.  This means that after a couple of years they will be sent to other regions where governments will most likely need them to switch from coal to gas.  At European level, we have committed to no co-financing for pipelines unless they are hydrogen ready.  There are some ongoing projects for gas interconnectors that we will need during the transition time because, according to our estimations, some natural gas will be necessary until 2050.  After that date, the gas market has to be decarbonised so the perspective is 28 years.<\/p> <p>  How can we accelerate renewable deployment?  There is strong ambition from the private sector.  We have strong technological know-how and we have production sites.  It is interesting that people in our windmill industry are complaining that in previous years they have been under significant pressure.  It was difficult for them to get private financing because no financial institution was willing to finance the projects since they did not know how long the permitting process would take.  This was a major bottleneck for that industry because financial institutions wanted to know when the projects would be ready.  The permitting throughout Europe has been very time-consuming.<\/p> <p>  We hope we will help this sector with our permitting proposal.  As the Deputy will know, we proposed three innovations, including allowing member states to dedicate certain territories as go-to zones where the permitting process is handled faster.  We also proposed there should be shorter processes when people want to re-power existing wind boxes.  This applies to wind boxes built ten or 20 years ago but, with the new technology, can now produce significantly more using the same land space.  We also proposed that the permitting process should be significantly shorter for solar rooftops.  These are proposals that member states and the European Parliament have to endorse before they become legislation, but I have had positive feedback from the European Parliament and member states.

I thank the Commissioner and her staff for their very interesting presentation and for the discussion.  I will follow up a little on the question of lock-in that was raised.  It is a real concern, and one the committee has discussed, that there is talk, for example, of contracts going to 2049 in respect of some of the new potential infrastructure around LNG.  There is a fear, in effect, that the idea of having new contracts going until 2049, and simply saying that in 2050 we will suddenly talk about net zero but not have a genuinely strong emission path up to it, is the real danger.  In fact, Europe, and the EU in particular, does not have 28 years, given our disproportionate responsibility for driving climate change.  We should be leading and ahead of the curve in decarbonisation as our fair share will be exhausted before that.  I am quite concerned.<\/p> <p>  Ms Simson mentioned the investment in new gas infrastructure if it is hydrogen ready, but it seems there is a lot of lobbying for investment in gas infrastructure and the conversion of gas infrastructure rather than, for example, investment in new infrastructure.  This is the case even when it comes to things such as hydrogen and green hydrogen or the idea of more investment in things such as ammonia or ammonia storage.  On LNG, given we have methane targets and methane is increasingly being recognised as an accelerant, and we know LNG and fracked gas in particular can drive that, there are dangers a major push on the LNG market will lead to an acceleration in methane emissions.  There are concerns about that.<\/p> <p>  I also know that - and this relates to the substitutions and the dangers of tying ourselves long term to fossil fuel infrastructure and new fossil fuel - Qatar, for example, about which Human Rights Watch has raised very significant concerns, is one of the major producers of LNG and one of the major exporters to the EU.  While people are moving away from Russian coal, there are concerns coal is now being purchased from the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Columbia.  There is a danger that while we are exercising sanctions on Russia we are actually contributing to human rights breaches in other parts of the world, and by continuing to invest heavily in gas and coal, even if we are not buying directly from Russia, we are contributing to the asset price and to that market.<\/p><p>We are at a crunch point in that regard in terms of what we scale up.<\/p><p> I have two specific questions, one being on the renovation wave and the prioritisation of public buildings.  I am not referring simply to the market in renovation.  Do we need security and energy-demand reduction to really accelerate?  Will the EU support these through public, not just private, investment in this area?<\/p><p> My last question is on the Energy Charter Treaty.  We talked about the dangers of lock-in.  Can countries seeking to make an energy transition, including developing and EU countries, afford to sign up to the treaty at a time when energy is so politically central?  Should the EU consider pulling out?  If the EU pulled out, would it give greater flexibility to developing-country governments in charting a more renewable energy path?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#G00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I will start with the Energy Charter Treaty because my team is negotiating its modernisation.  We have studied the position on opting out of an energy charter treaty.  However, as the Senator knows, there is a very long transition period in which we cannot change and do not have a right to change the organisational decision-making, but we remain a member.  The work is ongoing and we have not lost hope that we can modernise the charter treaty.<\/p> <p>  My next point is on lock-in effects.  Right now, according to the EU legislation, we do not have in place a ban on long-term contracts for the companies buying natural gas.  In our gas decarbonisation package, we just made a proposal that any contract signed by a private company should not extend beyond 2049.  The market participants are private companies and some of them, including Gazprom, have long-term contracts.  Some of them will last until 2040, so we believed it was necessary to give information to our trading partners that, after 2040, our gas market will be de-carbonised and that they will not have a trading opportunity involving fossil fuels.  Of course, we have also sent them a clear message that we will also prioritise their willingness to tackle their methane emissions, for example.  This was one of the main deliverables for my sector at the last Conference of the Parties in that we managed to sign a methane pledge.  More than 100 signatories, by signing, committed to tackling methane emissions.<\/p> <p>  There is a decision that EU funds will not be financing fossil fuel infrastructure.  This is REPowerEU.  We gave landlocked member states a right to use their recovery funds for some necessary interconnectors.  The situation is that we have several crises ongoing.  All member states have committed to becoming climate neutral by 2050 but this year some of them need emergency investments to get rid of Russian imports.  We want to help them to replace Russian pipeline supplies with alternatives.  It is not easy to replace them with renewables in such a short term.  This is what is behind the flexibility that offers some landlocked countries a window in which they can use their own recovery funds to finance pipelines.  Mainly, they will be financed against the market because, in the next decade, there will be a continuous demand for oil and gas.

Has she seen a study produced by InfluenceMap in the past few weeks that shows the ramping up of the production of shale gas and fracked gas in the US to replace Russian gas?  It is said its extent is like peace-washing in that it is like using the war to ramp up the extraction to a very extreme degree.  Huge profits are being made by the fossil fuel industry across the US on the back of this.  Has the Commissioner seen the study, and what is her view on it?<\/p> <p>  Does the Commissioner genuinely believe our expansion of LNG and new gas projects is sustainable or in any way in line with the climate goals given that the International Energy Agency and others have explicitly said to us that we must not have any new fossil fuel infrastructure if we are to reach our Paris targets?  Our reaching of these seems to be increasingly distant.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the energy market itself.  I do not expect the Commissioner to be familiar with our history but, about 20 years ago before we deregulated the market, we had a national company, the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, which supplied all our electricity, and we had the cheapest electricity for the consumer in the whole EU.  Our electricity prices are now among the dearest.  I interviewed representatives of the ESB during the week and they explained to me that although the company does not profit vastly from the huge increases in energy prices &ndash; many companies do, not only in Ireland but also across the board &ndash; it is subject to international energy price mechanisms.  Is it not time for the Commissioner and the EU in general to press for a review of how our energy is priced on the global market and do away with the extraordinary and obscene profiteering that is happening at the same time that ordinary people are driven into energy crises?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022060200002#H00500","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>We want to send a clear message to our trading partners that they can be our trustworthy partners if they take care of the environmental considerations.  That is why I mentioned earlier that methane is the second most potent greenhouse gas, with carbon dioxide being the first.

We are strong supporters of the International Methane Emissions Observatory.  This is a topic we discuss regularly with our US counterparts.  US companies are committed to taking care of the methane leakage.  Having said that, Russia, as a producer, has been relatively non-transparent about how it is reducing its fossil fuels.<\/p><p>Replacing their production with alternatives does not necessarily mean that we will end up in the situation where our emissions are growing.  On the contrary, we will try to find alternatives that are renewable.<\/p><p> On the global level, high fossil fuel prices are impacting us a lot but some poorer regions will be impacted even more.  Of course, we are monitoring the direct connection between high crude oil prices and what the impact is on food prices.  At a certain level this might mean there are countries that cannot afford sufficient food for their inhabitants.  This is a serious risk.  Together with our partners, we have developed and made attempts to control the world market prices.  The committee will know that all EU members states have strategic oil reserves.  Together with our International Energy Agency organisation partners, twice this year we have made the decision to partially release these reserves.  By doing that, we aim to stabilise the volatile crude oil market globally so that poorer regions will benefit from it.  By doing that, we also compensated the decline in oil that is coming from Russia.  As I mentioned, we have put in place already six sets of sanctions, the first of which is aimed at Russia's ability to produce oil or to import the necessary technology equipment for their refineries.  This is already impacting the world crude oil markets.  By releasing our strategic reserves we have attempted globally to control the market price, but there are some expectations that the market price will be higher than it is right now.<\/p><p> On the electricity markets, we tasked our European regulators to analyse what we can do to open our electricity market design in a way that it would be more resistant to unwanted volatility.

We were debating the protection of the Irish native honeybee. <\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the Energy Charter Treaty.  In 2018, Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m announced that investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, was over and dead.  Investor-state dispute settlement is not even on the negotiation proposals under the modernisation process.  It is my understanding that the EU is hoping the UN is going to deal with that.  If, however, we are now in a situation where we are talking about new liquified natural gas, LNG terminals, whether they are in Ireland or in other EU member states, we are locking in those provisions under the Energy Charter Treaty for all of those new LNG terminals by not withdrawing from the Energy Charter Treaty.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, working group's sixth report clearly referred to the Energy Charter Treaty as hindering progress in climate action.  It names the Energy Charter Treaty specifically as something that is preventing member states and Governments from taking climate action because we must compensate for the stranded assets of fossil fuel companies.  The first point is the element of why ISDS was not part of the modernisation process.  At what date is the EU going to cut its losses and say that we cannot modernise this treaty? If the EU intends to stay in and is successful at getting an EU carve-out from the ISDS provisions, how is that ethical when then say that the global south members who are joining the Energy Charter Treaty will not have same exemptions from the tribunal process?  Surely it is completely unethical to say that we have two sets of rules.<\/p> <p>  The second question is on the proposal.  I believe the proposal to remove the \"do no significant harm\" principle comes under the recovery and resilience facility legislation.  We all agree that we must do what we can to end the war in Ukraine and deliver protections and results for the energy-poor across Europe, but EU funds should not harm nature, climate, or the environment.  We would like to see that principle actually strengthened rather than removed.

We advise them that the recovery plans have to have high ambition on the climate-related projects.  Just yesterday we approved the plan for Poland.  It will dedicate 47% of financing to climate-related projects.  We face a situation when the Commission proposed a set of six sanctions that covered all the Russian oil imports, both seaborne and pipelines, and some member states had no alternative routes in place so they had to create a plan for how to build alternative pipelines.  It was impossible to finance them from energy funds because we had just completed negotiations and our Connecting Europe Facility is no longer suitable for fossil fuel interconnections.  We have committed that we will finance only the kinds of pipelines that are hydrogen-ready.  We truly believe that all the member states are willing to stop payments to Russia but they must do that in such a way that their security of supply is taken care of.  That was behind our decision to provide some flexibility to use recovery funds to build these alternative routes.  This is not something that we encourage but without it we cannot expect that we can reach consensus on banning all Russian oil products.

As one of the Co-Chairmen outlined, I am joined from the Department of Health by Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, Ms Deirdre Comiskey and Ms Audrey Hagerty, principal officer.<\/p> <p>   The PDS programme is one of significant reform.  Its aim is to provide equitable child and family-centred services based on need rather than diagnosis, aligned with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I firmly believe the equity the PDS programme aims for is a better approach than the previous model, whereby some children received a good service while other children received a very limited one.  Unfortunately, the transition to the 91 children's disability network teams, CDNTs, has not been smooth.  I have seen at first hand the phenomenal work the front-line clinicians are doing.  They are doing their best to support children and families, but even with 2,100 funded posts allocated to the CDNTs, such is the demand for services, as well as the recruitment issues with filling the remainder posts, that it is difficult to achieve the equity of service the PDS programme aims for.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I take full responsibility for where this policy has failed; the buck stops with me.  I acknowledge there is a perception the equity I speak of is one where we have levelled down instead of levelling up.  In my view, the PDS programme has tried to do everything at once and that simply has not worked.  To say otherwise would be disrespectful to the hundreds of parents I have met during my time as Minister of State.  Parents can see the Government's investment going in but, as many of them have told me, they do not see it translate into meaningful services on the ground.<\/p> <p>  As I said, staff are a pivotal part of the process and this is where the investment has, largely, been.  Since 2019, approximately 475 posts have been funded and allocated to children&rsquo;s disability services throughout the country.  However, while the HSE and its service providers are doing their best to recruit staff, it remains a significant challenge throughout the health and social care sector and especially so in the disabilities sector.  As a result, families are experiencing long delays in accessing crucial therapy supports for their children.  Let me be clear to the committee and any parents or clinicians watching the meeting.  I can see the policy is not working and I am trying to fix it, as are my colleagues in the HSE.  By that I mean that I as Minister of State, departmental officials, and Mr. Reid and his team in the HSE are developing a roadmap to bolster the PDS programme.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, a number of key areas need to be examined by this roadmap, that is: piloting the use of groups such as local Down&rsquo;s syndrome organisations to ease pressure on CDNTs, even if only for a defined period; the return of therapists to special schools where they have not been returned; the temporary use of private providers where CDNTs are especially strained; the temporary pausing of the individual family support plans, IFSPs, until the CDNTs have been better resourced; the expansion of the critical skills occupations list to include clinicians who could be recruited internationally; scoping out what could be done to entice undergraduates to commit to working for a CDNT after they graduate; a review of how of the national access policy is being implemented across the community healthcare organisations, CHOs; and some form of audit of how the PDS programme is being implemented throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Another key element is the need for better communication with parents.  It is vital to provide clear and timely updates to families but also to staff on all network teams.  There have clearly been instances of mixed messaging, which has left parents unnecessarily frustrated.  Wider recruitment and workforce planning is also needed to ensure not only that we attract and retain the health and social care staff required to deliver these important services but also that there will be a sufficient pipeline of graduates in the different specialties.  More generally, we need a more joined-up approach in areas such as disability and aids and appliances.  While the latter issue is not in my brief, it plays an integral part of many families lives, and while they may be already frustrated with the PDS programme, that is further compounded by what appears to be an overly burdened and slow-moving aids and appliances process, such that one family I am aware of have been waiting 16 weeks for a wheelchair and another child with complex needs has been given no access to bath support.<\/p> <p>  I am sure we will discuss this issue during the meeting but, before concluding my statement, I want to touch on the assessment of need, AON, process.  While children do not require an AON under the Disability Act to access health services, many parents continue to seek an assessment, as is their right.  On average, approximately 6,000 applications for an AON are received by the HSE annually.  One of the first initiatives I pursued as Minister of State related to the provision of &euro;7.8 million to clear a backlog of 6,500 AON applications, ensuring children who had been left waiting for an assessment would now have one.  Accordingly, as the CDNTs came online, clinicians would not be facing into a long AON backlog.  Importantly, these AONs were not completed using a preliminary team assessment, PTA.  While about 10,000 PTAs were completed while this method was in place, now, in light of the recent High Court ruling, many of these will have to be redone.  The HSE is engaging directly with the families of those who received a PTA to establish if they require a further assessment under the terms of the Disability Act.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the work the HSE is doing to revise its approach to the AON process and to ensure it will comply with the requirements of the Act while also protecting the commitment to the provision of intervention and therapeutic supports.  I am conscious of the CDNTs spending all their time carrying out assessments instead of interventions.  A balance needs to be struck and I am hopeful this can be achieved.  I also welcome any suggestions from the committee, or indeed from any clinicians or their representative groups, on an approach that works for everyone.  I am the Minister of State who is responsible for the PDS policy, and there is undoubtedly work to be done to make it work better for the children of this country.  My core objective as Minister of State with responsibility for disability is that every child have timely access to high-quality child-centred health and social care services that support each child to achieve his or her full potential, and I am sure we all share that purpose here today.  I look forward to further discussion of the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#B00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and invite Mr. Reid to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#B00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>One of the Co-Chairmen has introduced the supporting team who are with me today, so I will not read out their names again.  It is a pleasure to present to the committee along with the Minister of State.<br\/><br\/>Children with disabilities or developmental delays access health and social care services in a variety of ways.  Most of them access services such as occupational therapy, psychology or speech and language therapy through primary care services.  Children with complex needs access specialist disability services from the HSE and section 38 and section 39 providers.  Children's disability services have developed in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner whereby some children have received an excellent service and others have not done so.  The provision of services was inequitable and highly dependent on the child's disability, his or her age or where he or she went to school or lived.  Establishing children's disability network teams is an integral part of Sl&aacute;intecare's health reforms and is a key policy commitment in the programme for Government.  These teams will provide a better and clearer pathway with fairer access to services for all children with a disability based on their needs, utilise and fairly distribute available resources for the benefit of all children and their families and ensure effective clinical teams work in partnership with families and educational staff to support children with disabilities to reach their full potential.<\/p><p>The HSE is committed to providing high-quality and safe health and social care services to all service users, including those with disabilities and their families.  The HSE fully accepts that there are very significant challenges in current service provision, the level of unmet need and engagement and communications with service users and families.  In this regard, the HSE is committed to working with the Minister of State and all relevant stakeholders to ensure we provide appropriate supports for children with disabilities and their families. <\/p><p> At a recent meeting with the Minister and the Minister of State, the principles of the Progressing Disability Services, PDS, policy and service model were restated and agreed as the continued implementation imperative while also acknowledging that the transition to policy based CDNTs has been challenging for many families and staff.   <\/p><p> The HSE, in collaboration with departmental officials, is working to develop an overarching roadmap to support all stakeholders to support children with disabilities.  This roadmap will be completed in the coming weeks.  The document will broadly address the following key areas: communications and engagement with families-service users, Departments and relevant Ministers; reporting on CDNT activity; workforce planning; family-centred practice; education sector engagement; a process for ongoing review of the implementation of the PDS model; and assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005. <\/p><p> The Minister of State and I also attended a recent workshop involving clinicians, managers, service providers and family representatives.  This workshop is informing the development of clinical guidance to guide practitioners conducting assessment of need to take account of the recent High Court decision.  The HSE is also committed to an initiative to address the assessments required as a result of this judgement in addition to a commitment put in place earlier this year to provide 1,000 assessments for autistic children and expects to finalise the plan for this shortly. <\/p><p> HSE children's disability services have been reorganised under PDS.  The aim at the heart of PDS is to achieve fair access to services for all children with disabilities based on need.  Before this policy, children in different parts of the country with the same needs could be given much more or much less service based on geography rather than need.  This was unfair, inequitable and needed to change.  Making that happen is one of the most complex change programmes undertaken within our health service and while we have made good progress, we have a lot more to do before it is complete. <\/p><p> The HSE is facing some specific challenges in CDNTs, including a high level of staff vacancies and a limited employment market, large caseloads and long waiting lists and the legislative focus on assessment rather than intervention.  Recruitment is a major challenge across the health system including in disability services.  The HSE is progressing all available options to secure the necessary staff and we can further elaborate on actions we are taking to recruit staff.  We recognise that difficulties accessing services create additional stress for families.  Our programme of reform is intended to ensure that children have timely access to services based on their needs.  The HSE regrets the negative experience of families where the current service may fall short of what is required to meet the needs of their children.  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":679,"content":"<p>It is really important that we are here together to discuss this really important issue.

Was it appropriate for the person charged with developing the framework for the assessment of need to publicly state at a recent workshop on the assessment of need that the Disability Act needs to be reformed?  Is this not a contradiction?  Is it appropriate for the HSE clinical lead for disability to have a blog with commentary on Ms Justice Phelan's recent ruling on the assessment of need, including the statement that her judgement departed from best practice and conveyed an inadequate understanding regarding diagnosis and disability?  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#C00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I applaud the Minister of State's extremely hard and diligent work and how accessible her office is.  Noel Byrne is a saint.  He is just fantastic.  Last week, the Joint Committee on Disability Matters heard from Helen Holmes from the Campaign for Autism Inclusion Dublin 12.  Among the many issues she raised, she discussed the issues in CHO 7 where there are two CDNTS - one in Dublin 8 and the other in Dublin 12.  It was at the public meeting with the Minister of State that it came out that the HSE was refusing to attend those meetings.  The staffing for these two network teams is at an extremely low level.  There is a worrying turnover of staff.  Between the two, there is a vacancy for three psychologists, two psychotherapists, two speech and language therapists, one occupational therapist and one dietician.  Staff sick leave is not covered, the effect on any continuity of services to children is devastating and when staff renews, the service to the child must start over to accommodate the knowledge transfer to new hires.  A total of 56% of affected families in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 are without any services.  Of those who have services, 20% have had only one initial meeting, 8% are attending a parent course and the children of 16% are attending play therapy interventions.  It is an appalling crisis for children and their families and, therefore, it would certainly appear that the recruitment model is not fit for purpose and the resources are not being targeted where the need is felt.<\/p> <p>  There is a complete dearth of metrics.  This leads on to the issue of child places in school.  If we have not done an assessment of need and do not have the metrics on the sheer level of need among children because they are not being engaged in services, how are they going to be properly placed in schools and how are there going to be proper placements in schools or in the right schools?  It has a knock-on effect way beyond that.  <\/p> <p>  Last February, Mr. Reid very kindly took a call from me regarding a one-parent family with a terminally ill child with complex needs.  He was fantastic, as was the response from the team.  However, the mother was in a situation where her child had come home after a brief respite in hospice care.  Insufficient nursing hours were allocated to her and most nights, she was nursing her child alone in the middle of night.  The child is not young and has serious needs.  The additional nursing hours had to go out to tender rather than the service in which the child was engaged being extended because of governance issues with the agency nurses.  There was an expectation that the nurses would transfer from one service to another to provide the additional hours, which is in complete disregard of those nurses' employment rights.<\/p><p>They were expected to relinquish their service, but that is a whole other issue.  We are in the month of June.  The agency that won the tender has still not supplied the nurses to the mother.  The child has a life-limiting condition, and only has weeks or months - at the most - to live.  The mother is still caring for the child.  When the nurse did show up for partial cover of those hours, she could not be left alone.  The mother could not even go to the shop.  All other support for the family has to be provided by neighbours.  To be perfectly honest, the system is a disgrace.  I applaud parents for their dignity and the fact that they are not more vocal and extreme.  Ms Helen Holmes came in here last week and was so dignified in her responses and her contribution.  The situation is appalling.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth a number of months ago, we heard that it is going to take years for the recruitment issue to be fixed.  That is just appalling for the children who need the care in the here and now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#C00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I will make some general comments, then I might refer to some members of my team to comment on the specifics.  First of all, I want to acknowledge that there have been huge failings in communications and the consistency of communications, in engagement, in levels of empathy, and in consistency across different community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and areas.  I can see the inconsistencies.  I know what good looks like and I know where it has worked well.  I can also see where it has not worked well.  In response to the points raised by Senator McGreehan, I wish to state that everybody working in the service cares a lot.  People who are directly engaged with service users and those sitting alongside me today care.  They work night and day to make people's lives and the lives of families better.  We do care.  I want to put that on the record.  I am not trying to be defensive, but I wish to restate that we care a lot.  I also acknowledge that the transition has not gone well.  There are major gaps in policy that we are trying to close to get to where we want to be.<\/p> <p>  On the points raised on the Disability Act, I appeared before an Oireachtas committee alongside the Ombudsman for Children.  At that meeting, we made the point that there are inconsistencies and challenges around the Act, particularly in terms of our own roles and responsibilities and the roles and responsibilities of education.  The ombudsman has produced a report that recommends certain changes be made to the Act.  We agree with many of the recommendations that he has made.  We are not criticising a policy or an Act, but we are highlighting where we believe it can be made better.  We will be making submissions - and we have made submissions - to strengthen the Act and to make people's lives better.  I will refer to members of my team to respond to the points made on the workshop that we held.<\/p> <p>  In response to the points raised by Senator Seery Kearney, I will not comment on the individual case she referenced.  I know the Senator is not asking me to do that.  We have to be compliant with procurement procedures.  There have been occasions when we have gone to procurement for suppliers.  We have to find that balance of pragmatism and compliance with procurement procedures where we have to fill a gap in between.  The case to which the Senator referred highlights the need for a level of pragmatism in between compliance with procurement processes.  We have experienced and know for a fact that there are recruitment challenges not just for the HSE, but also for service providers.  A large part of the model of delivery of major disability services in particular is driven through section 39 organisations.  We know that there are gaps in funding models at Government policy level.  There are fundamental issues that the sector has to address.  Today, I will concentrate on what the HSE has to address.  However, gaps have been identified at a Government policy level.  <\/p> <p>  Specifically on the issue of recruitment, as we have discussed with the Minister, we are probably going to have to look at different ways of recruiting staff.  I am not just referring to recruitment in the market.  We are going to have to look at what levels we are bringing people in at, and what qualifications are required to being people in at a particular level.  We will have to look at that differently.  There are some examples of other healthcare providers bringing people in with different qualifications, enabling them to get experience and then upscale.  That is something that we are discussing with the Minister and some of the third level education providers.  We want to increase the pipeline of people coming through to the service.  The Minister has engaged with our colleagues in the other relevant Departments, including the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I will refer to members of the team to comment on specifics, but generally, we have committed to filling the 28% gap that exists in respect of vacant positions.  Looking at recruitment to the HSE over the past two years, we have recruited a total of 35,000 people.  That is a net increase of 14,800.  We need to recruit 9,500 people every year just to stand still due to the turnover of staff.  That is just natural turnover from people leaving on pensions and people leaving the service.  The net increase of 14,800 staff represents the biggest recruitment in the history of the HSE since its establishment.  However, it is still not enough for the service demands that we have.  Recruitment is a real challenge for the disability services sector, in particular.  We are going to have to look at it differently and look relentlessly at the numbers being recruited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>How many of the 35,000 people recruited in the past two years were recruited to do Covid-related work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#D00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":684,"content":"<p>Some 3,800 of the staff were recruited for Covid-related work, including testing, tracing and vaccination.

I really welcome them because it gives me an opportunity to talk about something which I think is very important.  The clinical programme was established to implement the UNCRPD.  As the Senator has highlighted, it is about rights, opportunities and so on.  It is not a programme which is narrowly technocratic and just sets out the clinical processes that should be used.  It is a programme that looks to the UNCRPD and compares it to what happens in the Irish context, and considers how it should be different.  The Senator referred to Ms Justice Phelan's comments on the assessment of need.  The implications of her judgment have to be addressed so that we are legally compliant within the HSE.  That is why we held a workshop.  We will ensure that we are compliant.  At the same time, it will reduce our ability to provide the interventions which we have just heard are so lacking.  It will reduce that opportunity, and in doing so it will increase clinical risk.  If I am the clinical lead of a programme whose function is to ensure the rights of people accessing services, I feel I would be running away from my responsibilities not to point out how the implementation of an Act results in increased clinical risk.  That does not mean that we are not going to comply with it.  Of course, we will comply with it.  We have to comply with it because it is the law.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, I want to strongly advocate for a change in the law.  I must say that I find it frustrating.  I have mentioned previously in this House that sections 3 to 13 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act have never been commenced.  That is not our fault or the fault of the Department of Education.  It is the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  The Disability Act predates the UNCRPD.  It is well-voiced that the Act should be revised.  It is nonsensical to revise the EPSEN Act and not to revise the Disability Act at the same time.  I am not going to hide my frustration with the idea that the Government is thinking that the clinical programme for disability should be looking at narrow clinical interventions, rather than trying to address the fundamental issues that are causing the problem.  The fundamental issues are structural issues which the Oireachtas should be addressing.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, the issues concern the pipeline of supply of professionals to be able to provide the service, and an Act that is no longer fit for purpose, according to the ombudsman.<\/p><p>They are also to do with an Act that is no longer fit for purpose according to the Ombudsman.  I recently returned from Malawi, where I was involved in the revision of the disability legislation there, which people considered way out of date.  It was put in place in 2011.  Ours is way more out of date.  I would appeal to committee members as legislators to make their contribution to addressing these issues by revising the Disability Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I will make comments on several other issues raised.  Senator Seery Kearney raised the issue of the absence of metrics.  It is a big challenge.  We have spoken at another committee meeting on the work we are doing on this.  We have signed contracts and work is under way.  We will commence rolling out a system in the third quarter of this year and it will be fully rolled out next year.  It will be critical for us to gather data.  In this day and age it is not okay that we rely on an annual collection of data with all of the challenges for people inputting and collating it and the time it takes given the importance of the timeliness and accuracy of data.  It is an important development for us for all of the reasons the Senator set out.  We absolutely agree.<\/p> <p>  As the meeting goes on this following point may be discussed.  Mr. Reid and the Minister of State referenced the work being done to develop a roadmap.  It will be completed in the coming weeks.  The intention is that it will be very specific on what it sets out and it will be very clear on the short- and medium-term actions that will be required.  It is something that will be communicated to all stakeholders, especially families, so they know exactly what they can expect from the services in the next three to six months or year.  There will be very clear commitments.  This does not take away from challenges that exist for us.  They are very real and we have to face them in balancing meeting our legal obligations on assessments of need while at the same time making sure children get the interventions they need.  We need to manage this with the resources that are there and establish how we increase resourcing capacity.

In her speech the Minister of State said the buck stops with her regarding the failure in the delivery of disability services.  The buck also stops with the HSE because it is tasked with the delivery of these services.  The Joint Committee on Disability Matters is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the UNCRPD.  I state here that the HSE is in violation of the convention.  Article 25 states health services needed by persons with disabilities specifically because of their disabilities are to be provided, including early identification and intervention as appropriate along with services to try to minimise and prevent further disabilities.  This is not happening.  I do not know whether the witnesses realise the stress families and children go through due to the lack of services.  Parents have told me the lack of services being provided is the difference between people living independently or in residential care.  If we were to look at it in a cold-hearted way, we would ask what will be the cost of this down the line.  The cost of not providing early intervention now will come back and cost a lot more later.  This is just in money terms and not in human terms.<\/p> <p>  According to the HSE's census of the children's disability network teams, there 524.5 vacancies.  This is an average of 28% across all of the teams but it goes as high as 33% on some teams.  I believe there is only one team that is fully staffed.  Perhaps there are two teams.  A total of 90 people on maternity leave have not been replaced.  There are teams without administrative support, family support workers or play therapists.  The teams cannot function.  They cannot provide the services they are supposed to provide.  This has to be down to a lack of workplace planning.  In 2014 the national model of care for paediatric healthcare services had a guide to workforce planning that included Progressing Disability Services.  Eight years later the teams do not function.  There are very big problems.  The witnesses have identified them and identified what they will do.  Why was this not done before it was rolled out?<\/p> <p>  Section 39 was mentioned.  What has been done to address the pay differential between section 39 organisations and the HSE?  Until this is addressed, we will see staff continue to leave section 39 organisations and go to alternatives.  Enable Ireland and many organisations will not be able to retain their staff or to deliver their services.<\/p> <p>  We have huge problems with CORU and the length of time it takes to recognise qualifications, particularly of those who have qualified overseas.  I have been contacted by many speech and language therapists who qualified in jurisdictions such as the UK but they are being refused recognition because of one thing not included in their qualification.  Could this not be provided to them when they are in the job if needed?  This is a sector in crisis and these issues need to be addressed now.  I am extremely concerned about the children who need services now.  They cannot wait.<\/p> <p>  The HSE's recruitment process is cumbersome.  There is a panel system.  Nobody agrees with the panel system.  Why can the children's disability network teams not recruit locally?  It would make an awful lot more sense.  It was mentioned that 35,000 people will be recruited to the HSE.  How many of these will be clinical staff or therapists as opposed to administrative staff?  Have there been trade fairs overseas to attract recruitment into this area?  Has there been enough discussion with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on ensuring enough people are qualified at third level?  Have we looked at an allocation allowance similar to that provided to ICU nurses to encourage people to work in disability services?  Unfortunately disability services have a bad name and many clinicians do not opt to work in the service.  They go to child and adult mental health services, primary care or the private sector.  There needs to be encouragement for them to work in this area.  Other jurisdictions used qualifications such as therapy assistant.  Has this been considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#E00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":691,"content":"<p>All of us are aware parents are at breaking point.  There is no question about it.  I have spoken to many parents in my area.  The lack of services and the effect this has on children has affected the parents.  We are inclined to speak about Covid and bring everything back to it.  This is unacceptable.  I met with representatives of CHO 5 recently and I had a very good discussion on the serious concerns I am addressing for parents.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I hear one thing from her and another thing from CHO 5.  With regard to funding and resource planning, will the Minister of State and the HSE discuss how demographic change will be addressed and how the current gaps in the service provision will be tackled to meet the demographic and unmet needs?  There is a very big issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State and the HSE discuss how they will work collaboratively to provide a service that enables meaningful early intervention to be applied consistently and enables it to include respite intervention?<\/p><p>One of the areas I feel has been totally neglected is respite, in particular overnight respite.  I know Covid was a concern in that regard.  In Carlow, and also in Wexford, some day respite is being provided and I believe that is working well.  It is important that we get more information on that.  It is good that at least there is some support as we need to address the challenges.<\/p><p> It is important that there is joined-up thinking, which I do not believe is the case at present.  I will give an example.  I am working with a lot of families at the moment, but I will not highlight one.  I am working with families where the children urgently need an adaptation grant for a bathroom.  I went to the council with the families and an occupational therapist was sent out, but the decision was that the grant would not be provided.  The families in question then got a private occupational therapist to do a report, which was sent to the council.  In one case the private occupational therapist said the child needed a bathroom adaptation grant.  However, the council said it was not within its remit.  It says \"No\".  I cannot understand how we have a system that is so broken that there is no joined-up thinking at all.  The only ones who are suffering are the beautiful children.  That is a concern for me.  I have met so many parents, as all of us here have.  We are all very passionate about this because we know the effect it has had on children and their families, yet we do not seem to be resolving it.<\/p><p> I want to get an update on the waiting lists across all the therapies and the plan for the elimination of waiting lists and early intervention.  What is the HSE's plan going forward?  I regularly work with the Minister of State, and she has always come back to me and done the best she could.  However, I feel we have no planning going forward.  We cannot tell a parent what the plan is, show where the money will be invested or say they will get their services.  I am working with parents who are waiting to have their child assessed for a school place but, again, there is a two-year waiting list.  Therefore, the child could miss out on a place in school.  That is absolute neglect.  I know we can make all the apologies we want, but at the end of the day we must make sure that we look after the children that need help.  We must also remember their families that are so stressed and tormented about their children.  We are trying to work with them.  Going forward, I want to know what is the plan for the Minister and the HSE so that we can go back to the parents and say we are going to find solutions here.  There is funding and we just need to have common sense.  Sometimes I believe common sense is not being applied.  In terms of joined-up thinking with the various stakeholders, everybody must be working in unison to make sure that services are being provided, whether that is a bathroom adaptation grant or a sensory room, which is another significant issue that arises.  Children need sensory rooms.  Reports exist saying they need them.  We must ensure that children with a disability who need a sensory room or bathroom adaptation grant get them, but they seem to be falling through the cracks.  I would welcome some answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#E00600","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleagues to come in on some of the specifics.

I do not disagree with what the Deputy said about looking at new ways of addressing the issue.  I touched on some of it earlier.  I will let the Minister of State comment on it, but I know the Minister has met with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and other Ministers on how we might approach things differently.<\/p> <p>  Pay and the differential rate for those in section 39 organisations is not something the HSE can address.  It is a pay policy issue, and it is not within our remit.  I met with section 39 providers last night, so we are connecting on this.  Retention is increasingly becoming an issue for service providers.  It is a very significant issue, but it is not within our remit.<\/p> <p>  I will let Mr. Bernard O'Regan address some of the questions on the CDNTs.

We can give the Deputy a table showing the breakdown of recruitment in the disability area.  I accept that it is still a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general point again in terms of the recruitment and retention of staff, and I ask that members please take it the way it is meant.  We all have a role in retaining staff in the HSE.  Every day I meet staff in this and other areas who care a lot.  Sometimes it is very difficult to work in the health service and also to retain staff because the amount of public pressure they are under is significant.  Recruitment must happen.  I accept there is public accountability, but we all have a role to play in retaining staff within the sector.  It is a great sector and the people who work in it are highly committed to it.  I meet many of them regularly.  I want to say that again because sometimes the public perception is that staff do not care.  Our staff care hugely.  They want this fixed as much as members, as parliamentarians, want it fixed.

We previously acknowledged that at a committee meeting.  In respect of the CDNTs, some of the staff are provided by agencies other than the HSE and they are also experiencing difficulties.  Some are section 39s, and the pay differential is a major challenge for them.  Some are section 38s and they have the same terms and conditions as HSE staff, but they are experiencing some difficulties in recruitment as well.  They are smaller and perhaps they have more agility than the HSE might have.  It is just reflecting some of the reality of the pool of people that we are drawing from, notwithstanding the fact that we do need to be as innovative and imaginative as possible and to explore every possibility in terms of recruitment, including the points Deputy Tully mentioned such as the use of assistant therapy posts.  That is something that we are working on at the moment and it will be included in the action plan.  We have already given some clarification to the CHOs that they can use assistant grades wherever possible, on the basis that it is an agreed and useful way, first, to bring people into the teams and, second, to invest in people who might stay for the long term and address some of the retention issues.

That is something we will continue to do in the coming years so that we can try to raise all the boats, in order that we have an equitable level of service across all CDNTs, and they will continue to grow beyond that.<\/p> <p>  There is work, on which the Minister of State and the departmental officials might want to comment, on the completion of the disability action plan on the back of the capacity review report.<\/p><p>That sets out the level of investment that we believe is needed over the coming years.<\/p><p> The other thing that goes to some of the point the Deputy was making is that this includes cross-departmental funding commitments that are needed to try to address some of that joined-up thinking gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":700,"content":"<p>It is not working in CHO 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#G00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I would not disagree.

For instance, there could be two occupational therapists who have exactly the same training and years of experience, and they are paid quite differently.  As the committee knows, over the last number of years, but more specifically over the last year, huge work has been done by disability operations in standing up these children's disability network teams.  That is being done within the structures we have and it has been very difficult.  The national pay policy is another area which it would be very important at a national policy level to address because that is the only way in which we are going to address that sort of inequality.  That inequality will result in people leaving, given they are going to get cheesed off if someone with the same experience is earning more.  There are a lot of things we can do on our side, including some very important things.

The census was conducted last October and some recruitment has taken place since, but I also secured last October an additional 180 posts which are added on to that, so the actual figure is 714 unfilled posts, to put that in context.<\/p><p>The Deputy is right in regard to the CORU piece and this is something I and my team have taken up directly with CORU.  There have been very good conversations between myself, Mr. O'Regan and his team around how we should look at the various people who are trained abroad.  Mr. Reid&rsquo;s opening statement referred to how we should look at that.  In a particular CHO area, Edel Quinn in Donegal always talks about the speech and language therapists being trained in Derry yet, at the same time, they cannot come and work on her teams because there is a module or two that is missing.  We need to see how we can bring those speech and language therapists to work on our teams while squaring it, or perhaps making the<b><\/b>circle a little bit rounder, so they can be part of our teams while also meeting the requirements of CORU.  That is just an example of it.  If we have that agile approach, we could shorten that gap an awful lot quicker because the three largest areas that we are trying to recruit into are occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy  To be honest with the Deputy, it is very difficult to fill those posts, not just in disability but in primary care as well.  We have to find an alternative.<\/p><p>The other piece where I have seen that has worked very well within mental health &ndash; Ms Yvonne O'Neill was involved in this - concerned the assistant psychologist posts.  We need to see that come across to the disability side as well in regard to recruiting assistant psychologists.  Creating different pathways and a pathway for employment and career opportunities within disability is not just all about staff seniority in that there have to be other mechanisms and entry points.  At the moment, we cannot provide the opportunity for students training in third level colleges to be on any of our teams due to the clinical risk because our teams are not full.  Therefore, we cannot even give the opportunity for young people to see what it is like to work within disability because we do not have a proper clinical opportunity currently and we cannot achieve that until we fill out our teams.  If that was available, there would be another entry point in third year and fourth year to show what disability would be like.  Those are the opportunities and that is the roadmap which, since 11 May, the HSE and I are working on to try to find how we can actually work this out.  It is not just one level; it is not one-size-fits-all.  We need to look at a multitude of areas in order to attract and retain staff.  I also believe that until such time as we get to the space where we can give that opportunity to have experience of working with persons within disability services, it will never be that attractive, and we do not have that opportunity in regard to entry points at the moment.<\/p><p>Mr. O&rsquo;Regan touched on the disability action plan.  That is with me at present and we are in the final stages of engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on it.  It is a huge document overall and it is a ten-year plan.  I am going to bite it off in three-year bites so it can be measurable and deliverable.  That is the most important thing.  Hopefully, that will help to build in the capacity in regard to what we are looking to achieve within it, but also in regard to building capacity in respite and residential services, which is very important.<\/p><p>Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to respite in her CHO area.  It is important to realise that respite funding was provided for her area and the house is there.  They have gone to recruit twice for the person in charge &ndash; or PIC, as it is called - and although the contract has been awarded and everything else, they cannot recruit that PIC.  It is sitting there since before Christmas and we want to open that service.  I have done my job and the HSE has operationalised it, but we cannot recruit because that last link is the person in charge.  That is where the Deputy will find an issue in her area.  At the same time, &euro;40,000 for overnight respite was also put in to support some of the families.  The Deputy also talked about the teams in her areas and I was fortunate last week to meet with people in CHO 5.<\/p><p>While we are talking about section 38 and 39 organisations, I am informed that documents will go to Cabinet next week to address some parts of this.  I am not saying it is all disability but it is looking at section 39s, so that conversation is there and I have had this conversation with the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  We need to have that conversation around making it a level playing field.  If someone is in the canteen of a PDS team, it will have HSE, section 38 and section 39 staff.  We knew at the start that this was always going to be problematic, and recruitment is the issue.  I also want to show the Deputy that it is not just section 39s that have the problem, by any manner or means.  When I look at the various teams across a network, 23% of HSE teams have a vacancy.<\/p><p>The HSE team in network 2 also has a 28% vacancy.  Enable, which is a section 39 organisation, has a 9% vacancy.  There is another 20% vacancy rate in the HSE, and the figures go on and on.  The greatest vacancy level, in network 6, stands at 54%, and this is a HSE team.  Therefore, it is not just the section 39 organisations that cannot recruit.  This problem being experienced right across the board.  This is why there is a willingness on both sides of the House to work together to find a pathway forward in this regard.  We must have various entry points.  I say that because what we have done in the past is not working.  We must be far more agile in our approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#G00800","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I welcome this meeting and the witnesses coming before us.  Starting with the individual family support plans, I had a parliamentary question on this issue answered by Mr. O'Regan.  It was dated 24 May 2022.  In that question, I asked the Minister of Health the number of individualised family service plans issued and accepted by each CDNT, broken down by CHO area.  The response I got was that the individual family support plan process is a live one, in that the team and family keep it under review while service supports and strategies are being implemented and as the needs and achievements of the child and family change.  Is the output of the individual family support plans being measured as this process is being rolled out?

The experiences of families of which I am aware, whether we like it or not, reflect a lack of confidence in the service.  Families are afraid that they are being sent down yet another road and to another service that they must sign up to get access to services.  I am not going to be rhetorical.  I just ask the HSE to be mindful of this point and if it can do that, it would be good.  We know what the experiences of families are.  We all know they are jaded now.  Let us take that as a given.  We all accept that.  If I dovetail the individual family support plan process now with the creation of the CDNTs, then this is again about measurement.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Ms O'Neill, another parliamentary question I submitted asked \"the number of children that have been transferred from Children's Disability Network Team back to primary care on foot of assessments since April 2021, by age, CHO and LHO in tabular form and general categorisation for such a transfer back to primary care operations\".  Ms O'Neill's response to me stated, \"Though there is no specific timeline on when the system will be available, I can confirm that there has been a procurement process and the system is now at the development stage.\"  Again, we do not have a live measurement of the families' experience as they are going through the system.  They are again being asked to sign up to a CDNT process and they are wondering how many more arguably bureaucratic processes they will have to go through before they can get access to the speech and language therapist, SLT, the occupational therapist, OT, the psychologist and all the therapy services.  Do the witnesses appreciate where I am coming from in this regard?  We must ensure that parents and children are minded in this context.  The bottom line in all of this is still access to the services, notwithstanding all the issues we are talking about here concerning recruitment, which is, effectively, the big elephant in the room.  I just want to hear from witnesses from the HSE that they are going to be careful and mindful of families in this process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#H00400","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I would like to comment quickly first and then Ms O'Neill can-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":712,"content":"<p>I am happy for Ms O'Neill to answer because she replied with the letter responding to my parliamentary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#H00600","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I am happy to answer the Deputy's question.  The answer to the question is the position on the procurement of the system.  I refer to having a line of sight regarding what a family has access to or, more importantly, what they do not have access to, being critical to us in how we offer services and how we join up services.  We must respect that a child is a child and a service user first and that may be the case in respect of a range of requirements, running from the least to the most complex.  It is critical, as Mr. O'Regan referred to earlier, in respect of the system, for us to be able to have that line of sight.  In a way, this helps to try to keep the family and the child at the centre of how we offer services.  It is difficult.  We see a million children each year.  Therefore, it is very difficult with paper-based systems to be able to respond to a query like that parliamentary question.  When such a question is asked, it pains me not to be able to give the Deputy the types of data at the level he would like to see them, because that is the position we are trying to get to.

When I am sitting and thinking about access to services, I think back to trying to access them myself for children with additional needs.  That was the case with my children when I had no capital or way to navigate the system.  I have since experienced trying to navigate the system with capital.  It is interesting to have been in both of those spaces and to have seen just how different those experiences have been.  This is why I wish to focus my contribution on the cohort of people who are not even making it onto the waiting lists for services, because there are many of them.  Mr. Reid spoke about the provision of services being inequitable and this being dependent on a children's disability, age, school and where they live.<\/p><p>I would like to hone in a little bit more on the school and where they live.  These can often come with many different assumptions and biases.  I suppose it is a cultural issue within the professional class.  I support many women - there are some men, but it is mostly women - who have experienced addiction in their lifetimes or who have experienced social service input into their families at some point in time.  Many of them are being completely ignored when they try to access services, especially for invisible disabilities.  For an obvious disability, it might be a little easier.<\/p><p> Many of the women who I support, of which there are currently a few, have spent ten or 12 years trying to get someone to just believe that their child may be autistic or may need psychology services.  It is constantly being suggested to them that this is a parenting issue.  There is a bias that arises from where they are from, where they live or the experiences they have had in life.<\/p><p> How we can begin to create an equitable service if there is a cohort of people within it who do not even understand the experience that people have when they are just trying to enter that space and navigate that world for themselves?  Sometimes the judgment is so much that they lock themselves away.  They fear trying to access services in case they put themselves on the radar of judgment or stigma.  How do we create a fairer system?  Mr. O&rsquo;Regan spoke about raising all boats.  However, if there are some boats that we do not even know need our support, how do we reach them?  Maybe this is a question for the Minister of State as well.  How do we create those advocacy supports at that base level, even in addiction services, and not only in primary care?  How do we go about looking at what already exists in family resource centres and in addiction services?  How do we place disability advocate supports there, so that people can get supports wherever they access services?  That is one question.<\/p><p> My other question is on metrics and it more for my understanding.  What type of data is the HSE collecting, and for what purpose?  Is this only to look at the waiting lists?  What type of data is collected?  I understand how important data collection is for efficiency and for understanding what we are dealing with.  I am also cautious about how we continue to build and use data in a way that will replace the human emotional intelligence in terms of how we assess people.  Is the Department looking at the use of AI in relation to any disability services?  If it is, is that underpinned by AI ethics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#H01500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I will start and then maybe Professor MacLachlan and Ms O&rsquo;Neill might come in.  The Senator raised the question of the data that we have collected on family-centred plans, as well as the development of the systems around it.  It is important to say that, fundamentally, the idea and principle behind a family-centred plan is simple.  It is to sit with a family to ask them what is the priority for their child and how we align the services towards it.  Any system we develop in terms of the metrics around that is a management information tool.  The point should not be to tick boxes.  The point needs to be around how we engage with families.  The system we are trying to develop will be around the outcomes that flow from that, as opposed to ticking boxes.  From a principle point of view, that underpins the approach that we are trying to take.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a point on how we grow an equitable service if there are people we do not even know we should be talking to and considering.  This is fundamental to progressing children&rsquo;s disability services policy.  This is about how we try to work towards an equitable service for everybody.  We are engaging with colleagues across services under Ms O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s remit to try to have joined up thinking around services for children.  We are also working with colleagues in mental health services, primary care services and in social inclusion to work towards services for children.  Those with disabilities are one group, but there are other children who have needs as well.  We need to have as much integration and coherence as is possible.  That is a work in progress.  It is on our radar.  The point the Senator made about possible unintentional or otherwise does not matter.  If people are excluded from accessing services, or if they do not have the capital to be able to even engage with the system, then whatever other failings are there as well, that is a complete failure.

There is no doubt that across the healthcare service there are huge inequities, including for people from working class and disadvantaged areas.  I come from Finglas west.  I grew up seeing disadvantage in access to healthcare.  It still exists.  It breaks my heart that it exists.  Certainly, the driver of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, PDS, was to try to get that balance.<\/p> <p>  In their experience of PDS, some people have found that they have lost some aspects of services.  The driver was to try to rebalance and provide services for those who have them.  I think 643,000 people, or 13.5% of the population, indicated in the last census that they have an illness that would indicate a disability.  That is a significant number.  One will find that a significant proportion of that figure may not even be identified, in areas such as Senator Ruane expressed.  We saw this during Covid-19 in vaccinations programmes and who was coming through.  This was not because they did not want a vaccination, but it was an issue of awareness.  High presentations of Covid-19 illness was in areas of high disadvantage.  These were primarily in urban centres, as well as in areas of high disadvantage across the country.  There are inequities.

We had a meeting yesterday where we were told that in one of the CHOs, 40% of the kids on the waiting list there were previously, prior to reconfiguration, not on any waiting lists.  Being on a waiting list is not what we want.  We want people to be getting an intervention.  However, they had previously been invisible to the service.  They are now an increased demand on the service, but at least they are on its radar.  Therefore, if there are people who continue to not be on its radar, we would be keen to know more about that.<\/p> <p>  The idea that parents are being blamed and that it is being suggested that it is a parenting issue is absolutely wrong.  It is one of the rationales for the individual family plans, so that it is not a matter of clinicians saying what your child needs.  It is a matter of working with the family to find out what important outcomes would be, etc.  If that is not working effectively, we would love to know that.<\/p> <p>  Many healthcare professionals come from very middle-class backgrounds.  They are often not very skilled in interacting with people from different cultural perspectives and so on.  We would like to target that.<\/p> <p>  On the idea of allocation of staff to children's disability network teams, CDNTs, we looked at that this year on the basis of population versus the number of therapists available within the teams.  We want to move to looking at, for instance, social gradients within the different catchment areas.  This is because we know the incidents of difficulties around disability are very much associated with socio-economic class and opportunity.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  That is an area where there is huge opportunity and a real opportunity for Ireland given we have so many digital multinationals located here.  The Global Report on Assistive Technology was launched recently and I am delighted the Minister of State was able to go to Geneva for that launch.  One of the reasons Ireland has such an interest in that area is we recognise the opportunity of digital and AI to address some of the social inequities not by replacing human contact but by being better able to target them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>It is not just about the social inequities but about how the machine learns, and the ethics in that, so it does not reinforce inequalities, in some sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#K00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":728,"content":"<p>That is right, so it is not fed with mainstream data which further marginalises people----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#K00400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>-----who are not in the mainstream.

I referenced St. Joseph's Foundation but it is one of many service providers where the same thing is happening, namely, they cannot open services and they remain closed because the providers cannot recruit.  I am being told they cannot because they are competing with the HSE.  I would like to hear from Mr. Reid about how the HSE intends to grasp the nettle on that one and where the Minister of State is then as far as ensuring we have parity is concerned.

Last night I met a section 39 provider in the area of mental health.  I was just referencing the provider was making the point about losing staff or trying to retain staff or maybe staff being cannibalised within the sector.  That is a factor.  Sometimes we are cannibalising within the HSE and sometimes we are cannibalising across the sector.  The Minister of State has touched on this and has brought forward some views through Government channels and that is where those things go.  We are experiencing it.<\/p> <p>  The market at the moment in the health sector is extremely tight.  One of the members asked earlier about whether we should go overseas.  We have had expos in Manchester and London.  We have feet on the street in India trying to recruit in terms of nursing.  We are looking at all kinds of innovative ways of doing it but the world market for health sector professionals, especially in this sector, is very significant.  On a positive note, I met a significant number in the past 48 hours around the west and north west and we are seeing more people coming back from overseas as well such as speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  They now are seeing full-time contracts coming into the community.  We are seeing a lot more people coming back.  The fear is always, and the expectation is, that we are losing people overseas but I was pleasantly surprised to see; I met a lot of people who have come back from the UK yesterday and over the past 48 hours.

However, given the challenges that are there with staffing levels within teams, the capacity for other people on the team to pick up additional work is very limited.

What have I done?  In the last month I met FEDVOL and the team, including Alison Harnett, about pay.  It was solely about pay around the section 39s.  The figure for pay restoration is &euro;20 million.  That is required.  Now I will hand it over to the relevant.  I know where I am in the asking process but I will hand it over to the relevant.  Pay is a policy issue for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but I know from a disability point of view what the cost is.  In my first budget I did pay restoration and I allocated &euro;10 million for that.  I have started it and do not intend to stop without having equality.  As the Minister of State going into the Department with responsibility for equality I believe in that equality across all of it.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say sometimes when we talk about the PDS teams and the number of HSE and the other leads on it, we might think everything is all section 39s, whereas is it is not.  Eight of the teams are section 38 and four of them are section 39.  It is important to contextualise that but it is a wider issue.  The Deputy talked about Cooleens House.  It has six rooms and provides enormous capacity to provide respite in north Cork.  The issue there, yet again, like with what I said in reply to Deputy Murnane O'Connor, is the recruitment of the person in charge, PIC.  They are able to find staff within the framework and that is exactly what we have in west Cork in the Beara Breifne.  The reason the house had to be closed was we could not find a PIC.  We are now identifying why respite might not be functioning and that is two houses I have note of in Cork, with one in the north and one in the south and it is to do with the PIC.  Earlier this year I met the F&oacute;rsa-SIPTU-INMO congress at one particular meeting.  I can tell members I knew my objective coming out of it, let us put it like that.  That was about the section 39s.  They play a phenomenal role.  I have asked Ms Harnett from FEDVOL if she can tell me the difference between the work the section 39s do and the section 38s and the HSE and there is no difference in the work or the delivery of the work that they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#K01200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":738,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am sorry that what I am going to say is not going to be pleasant but I am sure they have heard it all before.<\/p> <p>  The reason I am here is the dysfunction in the services.  I have a son who I speak about with his permission as he is very anxious I speak about this.  He is now 20 years of age.  You have failed him.  He has not received any meaningful physiotherapy, speech therapy or occupational therapy since 2011.  That is when it started, namely, with the crash and the austerity cuts that were imposed by some of the Deputies here.  A virtue was made of inflicting pain on people who were the most vulnerable in Irish society.  I spoke to Enda Kenny in 2011 and begged him as a parent: \"Do not impose any more cuts on persons with disabilities or carers\".  He said he could not give me that undertaking.  He told me this is a private matter between me and my son and that the State could not be expected to intervene meaningfully in the lives of persons with disabilities.  That is the ideological imperative that has brought us to this space.  My son receives no physiotherapy - none.  The only physiotherapy he has received in the past ten years was to measure his deterioration.  It is a struggle to get a wheelchair.  Would you please ask your staff to staff to stop revoking our medical card?  Would you please ask your staff to staff to stop revoking our public services card with his companion for travel?<\/p><p>The obstacles that have been put in front of families like mine add insult to the injury that has already been inflicted.  You are inflicting harm on our children.  You have failed completely.  The Minister of State mentioned the progressing disability services and the language in the documents are a unicorn as they do not exist.  Maybe they do exist in her imagination but it does not exist on the ground.<br\/><br\/>In our lived experience children deteriorate for a lack of intervention to the point that it becomes life limiting and life threatening.  In Eoghan's case, his scoliosis was so bad that his lung function was reduced to about 25% and the curvature of his spine had compressed his chest cavity to the extent that his heart was not located where it should have been.  When a paediatric cardiologist scanned his heart and performed an echocardiogram she invited her team to take a look at the scan as it was such an extreme example.  Eoghan watched his own heart on the screen and he got such a fright that he got sick into the sink.  He has a great sense of humour because he said that it is all right for everyone else because it is not their heart on the screen.<br\/><br\/>When Eoghan had surgery he was an anaesthetic risk because there was a possibility that he would not survive.  For his transition year he underwent surgery but the procedure was far too late.  The surgery took nine hours and afterwards the anaesthetist manually ventilated and stayed in the theatre with him.  Even though she has her own family she stayed until she manually took him off the intubation because she felt that he might not survive in intensive care.  All of that was avoidable.<br\/><br\/>The problem does not lie with the clinicians, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists or occupational therapists.  The problem lies with the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department of Health and their failure to meaningfully engage with groups like the IHCA and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  The Government must restore pay equality.  I am glad that the Minister of State has met a few of our medical graduates who came home.  Why does she think that all of our physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists are leaving to go to Canada, Australia or the UK?  It is because this jurisdiction is a crap place to work.  I have a family member who works as a doctor in the system and her advice to any young person is to leave this jurisdiction.  During the week Dr. Ray Walley said that 75% of medical graduates plan to leave.  I have other family members who have qualified and none of them will stay here or work in the system that the Minister and Minister of State preside over.  The reason we have waiting lists and there is a lack of interventions is because the people do not exist on the ground and the same applies for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Many hundreds of hospital consultant posts remain unfilled and that, in turn, feeds into waiting lists and chaos, which must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>The problem lies with the Minister and Minister of State and they have failed.  On 11 June, I will be on the street outside the GPO with parents to talk about unmet needs and parents in absolute <i>extremis<\/i>.  How does the Minister of State think it makes me feel, as a parent, to see my child deteriorate?  Instead of saying we are failing, etc. will she please issue a statement from both the Department of Health and the HSE to the effect that they have failed?  If so, I can talk to the parents attending the protest and say that the Department of Health and the HSE admit that they have failed.<br\/><br\/>You have failed and we are in crisis.  It is a bit like seeing all of the people outside of Dublin Airport.  We, the parents and families, cannot be seen because we are a hidden community.  As a parent, I know that it hard to even get out one's front-door properly dressed due to all the stress.  I cannot even attend the meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters because my son's care package has failed and collapsed.  The irony of the fact is that I cannot do the business, as an elected representative who has been appointed to attend joint Oireachtas committee, because of a failure by the Minister of State.<br\/><br\/>When will pay equality be restored?  Please give me a timeline.  Will it be June or December of this year or in 2023?  I ask because medical staff will not return until that happens.<br\/><br\/>Finally, my next query is for the Department of Health.  I have some sympathy for Mr. Paul Reid as a fellow Finglas man and this is not a situation entirely of the HSE's making.  When will the Department of Health, and particularly the Secretary General, engage in meaningful negotiations with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and other associations?  Pay them and they will return because we have the most extraordinary graduates like the anaesthetist who manually ventilated my son.  This is the only country in the world that treats its medics and clinicians in such a negative fashion.  I know from my family members who work in the system, and from all of the correspondence that exists, in the HSE if a medic raises issues around patient safety or unsafe practices then he or she will be bullied.  They will be denied leave to do their continuing professional development or annual leave and that is a fact.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the previous Minister for Health yet no action was taken.  The HSE has a toxic workplace culture.  I know that Mr. Reid will be unhappy with that situation and it is a matter that he really needs to address.<br\/><br\/>The answer to all of the problems that we are talking about, and I mean this unicorn that has been called progressing disability services, is that people must be recruited.  One can only recruit and retain people if they are paid properly and treated with even the minimum of dignity and respect.  In terms of my son and all of the many hundreds of families who have contacted me, you have failed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#K01400","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":741,"content":"<p>Senator Clonan deserves a direct response from the HSE now.

The services, the language being used, the documentation and the plans are a unicorn, which does not exist.  In terms of people who are benefiting from services, Ireland is the worst country in Europe in which to have a disability in terms of suboptimal medical outcomes, poverty, social isolation, lack of timely interventions, unhappiness, unemployment and homelessness.  It is a disgrace, and the Department has failed.  It is not that it is failing; it has failed.  It is a failure.  It is that very energy that has brought me here and got me elected.

They are exhausted just trying to get the basic services their children need for the children to reach their basic developmental milestones.  I concur with Senator Clonan.  Those parents would agree that they have been failed as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to the start with Mr. Reid.  Nobody in this room has the monopoly on saying that the staff in the HSE care.  I agree with him.  I have met staff members in the CDNTs and I have family members who work directly with children with disabilities, and nobody goes into that line of work without caring.  For me, it is a vocation for them.  They go there because they want to make a big difference in the children's lives.  However, it is the systemic failures in the HSE that have led to these staff members being frustrated and to a mass exodus of staff from the HSE.<\/p><p>Deputy Sherlock asked a question that was not answered.  It was regarding the number of people have left the CDNTs since January.  Are exit interviews being conducted with these staff to find out why they are leaving and measures being put in place to stop this?  That is important.<\/p><p> The other matter I will touch on is probably the elephant in the room.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's honesty in respect of taking full responsibility for the failures regarding children with disabilities.  In any engagement I have had with her, I have found the Minister of State to be a straight talker.  I agree that the buck stops with her, but it is not just her.  I notice the gap between the HSE and the staff here.  It is very visible.  The optics are not good.<\/p><p> A concern I had recently was when the Minister of State was continuously blocked by the HSE from getting on-the-ground updates amid concerns she had about services for children with disabilities.  Has this matter been resolved to the Minister of State's satisfaction?  Is she getting the information she requires?

Each of the 91 PDS teams should have parents' forums so parents have an opportunity to engage with their teams and discuss it.  They should not have to go on \"The Late Late Show\" in any area.  They should be able to iron it out locally and have a good working relationship.  Children who come to the CDNT teams do not exit quickly.  They can be there for some years and come out at 18.

It is disappointing that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, did not see fit to attend.  While no one can doubt the Minister of State's commitment, given the scale of the issue involved and the failure to progress disability services, the least families would expect is the presence of the Cabinet Minister.<\/p><p>The evidence is overwhelming that progressing disability services is currently a failure.  It is failing children and families and breaching their rights.  It is not providing therapies when they are most needed and effective.  All present are aware of individual cases that represent the severe lack of services.  Down Syndrome Ireland, AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland and all the other representative groups have comprehensive reports showing the overall situation, from glaring regional variations to no therapies for more than a year, as well as a complete absence of communication.  This situation has gone way beyond the point of us sitting around and talking about what a disaster it is.  It is a breach of people's fundamental human rights and it is literally ruining people's lives.  Every week at the disability matters committee families, advocates, representative groups come in and explain how awful their life is as a result of this.  It has reached a point where, as a member of that committee, I am not comfortable with it any more.  We do not need more people to come in and tell us how awful it is and how challenging are their day-to-day lives.  We do not need that any more.  We know that.  What we need is action.  <\/p><p> The purpose of the disability matters committee is to oversee the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is glaringly obvious at this point that the reason Ireland has not ratified the optional protocol is simply the number of cases that would be taken against the State.  As many Deputies have highlighted, it is a breach of people's rights.  It is a breach of the convention.  If that optional protocol was ratified, a sea of cases would be taken against the State.  That is the reality.  For too long, the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act not having been implemented has been the excuse for not ratifying the optional protocol.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 has been rushed through this week because a case has been taken against the State.<\/p><p> My questions are mainly for the Department.

I have been listening to the meeting all morning.  I refer back to what Senator Clonan said about his lived experienced with his child.  To be blunt about it, it is something we have been hearing in the committee from families and from people representing families who have children with disabilities.  Bluntly, there is much talk going on but the people on the ground are not getting the service they require, deserve and are entitled to.  When the children&rsquo;s disability network teams were being set up, I believe all parents were getting the excuse that they were setting up the teams and once they were in place, they would have the world and all.  In the meantime, families were being left waiting.  There has been a failure to actually put these teams in place in an efficient manner to make sure that children get the services they deserve as a right.<\/p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to reiterate that we have failed our children who have disabilities.  I do not want to see or hear a hell of a lot more talk about reconfigurations, team building and this, that and the other, and having all the paperwork right and a hell of a lot of money spent on it, and yet not have the services in place.  <\/p> <p>  Only last week we had representatives from Down Syndrome Ireland in the committee.  They told us of a survey they carried out among their members in which 65% of the respondents said they did not have one therapy session in 2021.  That was 65% of the children with Down's syndrome.  This is something I ask the officials to take away with them.  The therapists are not there.  They told us international recruitment is not happening by the HSE.  Again, the section 38 and 39 organisations, which are a complete farce in this country, have left us with a triple tier of health payrolls and we have inequality within staff.  We have that inequality petering down to the children who cannot get services.  <\/p> <p>  The other thing I keep hearing &ndash; this is not from the Minister of State &ndash; is that basically, the Government will tell you that money is not the problem.  However, I do not think that parents want to know what the problem is not; rather, they want the problems solved.  There is a wake-up call for people who are involved in these services across the country to provide an equitable, accessible service whereby any parent who has a child with special needs will be given, first of all, a case worker who will bring the parent through the pathways where everything will be for that family.  At the moment, when parents find that their children have a special need, it becomes a war zone for them within their family, as a result of what is not being done by the HSE and the Department of Health.  That did not start today or yesterday; it has been going on for years.  It is a war zone.  The only thing that parents have in their minds is that they have to try to prove everything for their child.  For example, when parents have a child who is permanently blind from birth, every time they are looking for some sort of support, they have to go back and get consultants' letters to prove that their child is still blind.  That is unforgivable.  I get emotional about this because I feel that we as politicians and as governments - not just the Government of today, but continuously &ndash; and the HSE continuously, have let our people with disabilities down badly.<\/p> <p>  There are many things to be done.  The questions I had have already been asked.  In a nutshell, we need to realise that this is not about protecting systems, ourselves or this, that and the other, and we need to take a bit of courage into our hands.  I would say to Mr. Reid that it is time to put the boot in where it needs to be put in and make sure that the services are delivered and we have staff in place.  For example, we had a witness telling us last week that they had been given an appointment.  They were in the waiting room, waiting to be called into the appointment when they got a text to say that the appointment was cancelled.  They were then told another therapist would perhaps be able to see them.  Somebody else came out and said that the other therapist was out sick as well.  That is not the way to treat families, people with disabilities and our fellow citizens in this country.  There is a huge amount of goodwill and volunteering going on by people and parents.  They are fundraising and they do everything for the sake of their children.  The more they do, the more we stand back and let them at it, because it is easier.  However, it is wrong.  <\/p> <p>  I will finish on this.  Today, I ask the visiting officials, no more than did Senator Clonan, to admit it has been a failure and say that we will start from today to put it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#Q00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":830,"content":"<p>Like many others here, I have been inundated with concerned parents who are heartbroken, physically broken, who have been worn down by the constant fight by being on the receiving end of that adversarial and hostile response that Senator Clonan talked about and by being forced to fill the gaps in services themselves.  In attempting to paper over the cracks, we have tried to make parents the therapists, which just is not working.  These are parents who are emotionally, physically and mentally falling apart because of the strain that is being put on them.  There are, in turn, other knock-on consequences from that deep physical and emotional strain that we do not have time to get into today but which are incredibly important.  We need to start at that point of acknowledging those parents and the continued uphill struggle they are facing.<\/p> <p>  There is so much we could talk about but on the issue of staffing, at the end of the day, there are just not enough staff members to complete the assessments and do the work.  One of the issues here, of course, is retention.  I am quite worried.  Mr. Reid talked about how there were 35,000 new hires, but a net growth of roughly 14,000.  That is terrifying.<\/p><p>That is a huge number of people leaving the service.  To recruit approximately 35,000 people and to have a net increase of only about half of that is a sad indication of the loss of staff.  We could drill into that.  There is a net increase but are we losing clinicians and getting more administrators?  What do the figures look like?  If that is across the entire HSE, it covers hundreds of grades and roles.  What is the net figure for front-line clinicians?<\/p><p> We have discussed conditions a lot here.  These people want to be clinicians and they do care, as we have all acknowledged, but they are left managing bureaucracy, juggling case loads and meeting patients to tell them where their place is on the waiting list and how they will not be getting a service.  That is all they are doing.  We need to fix retention or we will be in a lot of trouble.  Much of fixing retention comes through the pipeline, as we have used the phrase here, of getting in new therapists.  I am coming at this from my social work background but we have been told that the HSE has specific problems recruiting speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  A psychologist in training who is doing their clinical training is paid a salary.  In my time as a social work student, I remember doing my placement in a child and adolescent mental health service in which trainee psychologists who had about as much experience as me, or less, were getting paid while I, as a trainee social worker, was not.  The same goes for the speech and language and the occupational therapists.  If we want people to engage in the training we need to look at that.  Perhaps I should be looking at the Department on that.  Alongside that, there are many people who want to do the training and perhaps cannot afford it.  We are talking about trying to be creative and find new pipelines.  Part of that is recognising non-academic experience and trying to find new ways into the service but also supporting people to get into the education that is there.  We need to consider if one of our problems is that people are training and then leaving.  I have worked jobs where I have had my training paid for me on the condition that I sign a contract that I will not run away straight away and there are various clawbacks.  Why are we not doing that?  I appreciate that this may be something for a different Department - that is another siloing thing which we could drill into for hours - but can we explore something like that whereby we pay someone to become a speech and language therapist on the condition that they stay?  Then we can get an increase in numbers that would improve the conditions and hopefully get people to stay longer and you would be preventing all of that.<\/p><p> Another issue is filling the gap with private providers.  I seek reassurance that any private providers we are using are suitable, up to scratch and properly qualified and that there is proper oversight and that we are not letting rogue elements away with it.  I noted in Minister of State's opening statement that the private providers are included in the roadmap which spoke of \"piloting the use of groups such as local Down&rsquo;s syndrome organisations to ease pressure on CDNTs, even if only for a defined period\".  I must express concern about that because we have a habit of doing things for a defined period in an extreme circumstance and then they become permanent.  I am concerned that, as I have seen in other areas, we pull in community organisations to do the work the State should be doing and it becomes a permanent, unfunded or underfunded mandate of these community groups, with the people who are due to get the services being the ones to suffer.  I seek reassurance that it is a defined period and that it will be very short.  The same logic applies equally to the pausing of the individual family support plans.  Many people in my constituency have told me that they feel the individual family support plans are not worth the paper they are written on because there are not the staff behind them to deliver.  They would see no problem in throwing out individual family support plans if it meant getting the actual services.  Again, we are in the situation where we are scrambling to move beyond the failure but sowing the seeds for failure down the line by removing what can be a very useful service, if properly resourced.  <\/p><p> If legislation has not been commenced properly, that is not a failure of the Oireachtas.  The power to commence legislation is not in the House but in the Minister's wrist.  That is a function of the Executive.  If there are issues with legislation needing to be reformed or commenced, that needs to be taken up with the line Minister directly.  I am concerned that any attempt to reform legislation must be done in a way that does not undermine the existing statutory rights.

I think that is an example of privatisation gone wrong.<\/p> <p>  If these have been answered earlier, I apologise.  I had other meetings to go to.  In December 2021, Mr. Reid stated that the HSE did not want to publish the Brandon report in full because it did not want to \"compromise\" the scoping review into whether disciplinary action was required.

Thirty-five thousand is the total number of people we will have had to bring into the system.  I say that figure because it has never been achieved in the history of the HSE.  We have had to put in place a whole new set of recruitment processes in place nationally, locally and internationally.  There are recruitment processes, particularly for nursing, in India, the Philippines and the Middle East.  We have targeted about 1,800 nursing midwife professionals to come in from international campaigns.  That is along with the 1,500 nursing midwife graduates this year to whom we want to give placements.  We have never achieved any figures like that.  We can forward a breakdown of figures for this year to date to reassure the Deputy.  We are at a total staffing level of just over 137,000 whole-time equivalents.  That is about 150,000 staff.<\/p><p>The vast majority of this year's recruitment has been primarily focused on front-line services.  In primary care services, for example, 80% of recruitment has been to front-line professions.  We recruit management and administrative staff because we need people to manage and oversee services and to provide services of a safe quality.  We are recruiting in a different way.  It is a strategic recruitment plan that we have never had before, with us recruiting on a three- to five-year basis.  We want to ensure that we are targeting the gaps.<\/p><p> Regarding the churn, approximately 4,000 of the 35,000 people were recruited for testing, tracing and vaccination.  They were people who wanted to return to the workforce, and thankfully did, and now want to return to retirement or whatever other roles they play in society.  The 9,500 churn within the health service involves people retiring - a significant number will retire over the next three years - as well as others leaving the service.  We have a large, young and mobile workforce and people will emigrate again, particularly now that this opportunity has been restored.  This churn is not completely out of kilter with what I have seen in the private sector or across the public service, but it is a large churn just to stand still.  I was making that point to provide some context.<\/p><p> The recruitment breakdown is approximately 4,800 nurses and midwives, 470 consultants, 2,000 healthcare assistants and a further 4,000 client and patient care staff.  These are people working in front-line services.  This is significant recruitment.  To restate what my colleague, Ms Crehan-Roche, mentioned, we are seeing some people returning through the international recruitment campaigns.  We have done the early stage of a study of people, in particular doctors, who did not go away for reasons of pay, but for good quality conditions and healthcare that they did not view us as having.  A significant proportion of those people return within three years.  There are benefits that we can take from people going away, getting experience and returning.  That will happen in the health service.<\/p><p> The retention of people in whose training and education a significant investment has been made is a major policy issue.  We are seeing some of the impacts of people leaving.  Some countries employ a period of a sustainable number of years where someone must stay in the service.  I do not see that working, but this is a significant issue.  In recent years, though, our graduates have generally been staying.  Of course, people can now travel more.<\/p><p> We have discussed pay disparity issues.<\/p><p> Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd asked about the NIRP process and the Brandon report.  As I stated publicly at the time, there were a couple of reasons for producing that report.  First, the NIRP report process is one that facilitates people coming forward to contribute on a confidential basis.  They are given that commitment so that we may extract from them information on where harm occurred.  That was the approach recommended by the NIRP and its chairperson, and remains so to this day in terms of our publication of the executive summary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Is the scoping exercise finished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#S00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

Mr. Reid will agree that the frustration expressed by members comes on the back of the frustration, exhaustion and pain experienced by many parents of children with disabilities.  On Tuesday, Deputy Tully organised a briefing in the AV room for parents of children of disabilities in Cavan and Monaghan.  There were four parents at the meeting, all of whom held up photographs of their children, who varied in age from five to 12 or 13.  What was consistent across their cases was that most, if not all, had been failed by the system.  Some of them had received no services whatsoever while the services for those who did get some were patchy and few and far between.  That was just one meeting of ten that I attended in recent weeks.  I listened to hundreds of parents express their frustration, exhaustion and pain.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult for parents of young children with disabilities to look at young adults who have been failed because early intervention did not happen and many of them got no services, leading to developmental problems.  I am a parent of two young boys.  Any parent would do what they could for his or her child.  If you have a child with a disability, you just want to have the services as quickly as possible and to get the best for your child.  We have to give expression to the exhaustion, frustration and pain that the parents feel.  It is not a reflection on any individual staff member or even anyone in this room.  When we last discussed this issue months ago, I stated my belief that everyone in the room should have been ashamed of the failures in this area.  This is not to say that there were not successes or that there were not children who got good services, but for those children who we failed and are continuing to fail, we should all feel shame.  This is particularly the case when you have to look into the eyes of those children and their parents.  The Minister of State has engaged with many of the parents.<\/p><p>They have got to the point where they do not want to attend meetings any more because they are hearing the same stories.  They want solutions and to know when things will change.  I accept that there are no easy solutions either, but I will put some questions in that regard.  That is how people feel.<\/p><p> Turning to Mr. O'Regan, part of the problem is that we submit parliamentary questions to get information and basic data and he responds to those on behalf of the HSE.  We do not get answers.  Here are some examples.  I asked about the number of open cases involving CDNTs where individual family service plans are in place.  The information could not provided.  I asked about the number of persons who have received assessments of need but not service statements.  The information could not be provided.  I asked about the number of children who have had assessments of need and where a need has been identified but services have not been provided.  The information could not be given.  I asked about the number of children referred for services; these are not numbers having assessments because we know they do not all need assessments but, rather, those who have been referred for services and got none.  The information could not be provided.<\/p><p> We know there are issues with the database that underpins the recording of this, and we went through this before.  Again, I do not know if the issue has been resolved, although the witnesses have spoken about a new integrated system that needs to be put in place.  The section 13 annual reports were to be published going back a long number of years.  I still do not know if those reports have been completed or published.  If the executive does not have basic data and I cannot understand the need, how can anybody understand it?  That is the real frustration for me.<\/p><p> I have engaged with the Minister on this matter.  Children have a right to assessments, which should be as comprehensive as possible.  I also accept that the critical area is services and that children need access to services.  That is where we must put all or most of our energy.  Staffing is the key issue.  The census was published in April but it is out of date because the Minister of State has indicated that the figure for vacancies is not 524.5 it is 714.  We cannot recruit the staff and there are reasons for that, which must be addressed.  If we do not do it, we are at nothing.  We will face those parents time and again, month after month and year after year without any resolution.<\/p><p> I have a number of direct questions for Mr. Reid.  What is the engagement between the HSE and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science with respect to training places?  We must clearly recruit and train more professionals, and that process must be ratcheted up quite dramatically over the next number of years.<\/p><p> We have an access to care fund for acute services.  I say this as somebody who, from an ideological perspective, would prefer the use of taxpayers' money for the funding of the health services went to public services.  Looking at these children and parents in the eye, however, if there is the possibility of purchasing services from the private sector for them, we should do that in the short term.  It is not a long-term solution but it could be used in the short term.  We should look at a similar fund for community services, particularly in the context of children with disabilities, with a similar fund in place for mental health services.  Is that something the HSE would consider and put in place?<\/p><p> I do not have the monopoly on answers, and nobody has all the wisdom and solutions.  We all want to get there.  I will do absolutely everything I can and work with the Minister and the people across from me to resolve this matter.  The failures people raised earlier are real, however, and must be acknowledged.  They are part of a lived reality.  I ask, in that spirit, that everything humanly possible be done to resolve the matter and that we put a plan in place that people can see will work over time.  Nobody is expecting a magic-wand solution - it is not there - but we should be able to fix the problem over time.  We must fix the data problems as well because if we cannot have basic data, we cannot plan or fully understand the extent of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#S02600","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree on the data issue, including in terms of our accountability.

He referred to the census.  I must acknowledge the work done by Ms Angela O'Neill and her team did in compiling that.  It is an excellent document and has been a phenomenal tool.  The validation that took place on that is a fantastic cornerstone of the conversations we will have.  I used the word \"additional\", but that is only in the context of the budget.

Sometimes \"admin\" is not a good word within the HSE.  That is unfortunate because I need administrators to do their jobs within these teams.  I have continuously asked the team here if I can have those staff because without administrators, it is the clinicians that are doing it.  I want the clinicians to be doing their interventions because we are all talking about needing those interventions.  Our commentary and language can sometimes hold us back in certain ways.  I am saying that we need to have administrators on our time.  We need a minimum of two because we cannot have therapists answering the phone or handling the clerical end of things.  It is really important because we do not have them on all our teams.  I know Mr. O'Regan and Professor MacLachlan are tired of me talking about this, as is Ms O'Neill.  We need that.

I thank the delegation from the HSE, the Minister of State and officials from the Department for being here.<\/p> <p>  This has been a joint meeting aimed at trying to address the issue under discussion.  It is important that it has been accepted here this morning there are failures in respect of children right across the spectrum.  When I took the job of Chair of my committee, I stated that the Taoiseach would go before the Houses to apologise for the way the State has treated children with disabilities.<\/p><p>That was evident from the meeting.<\/p><p> A number of themes have arisen on what needs to be done.  At the very outset of the questions I thought there might have been an HSE versus the Department of Health discussion as to what legislation needs to be changed and what needs to be done.  From the way the meeting has gone, however, it is clear the recruitment drive needs to be made to ensure, as regards the teams that are being proposed,that  we have the recruitment of full teams and the retention of staff.<\/p><p> I look at anecdotal evidence that we have received over recent days where, in the past two or three weeks, people who have been on temporary contracts with the HSE or with one of the service providers have not had their contracts renewed.  They have had to proceed somewhere else to get a permanent contract because they were looking to purchase houses or to do the normal day-to-day living things.  That has left vacancies within the service for people with disabilities, whether that is in respite, in the HSE or in section 38 or 39 organisations.  As everybody here has accepted, there is a shortage of staff within all of the services.  We have see in the past week or two that people have had to leave the services because the State has not done its business in ensuring those staff members were retained.<\/p><p> We have heard it from different areas that there has been a brain drain.  We have people here who have given their time to caring, who understand people with disabilities, who care passionately about them and about improving their lives, and we need to ensure we are keeping those people within the services.  The section 38 and 39 organisations and the parity of esteem in pay is a matter that needs to be dealt with because every logjam must be removed to ensure we keep all the good people in the services.<\/p><p> I made the point in the D&aacute;il yesterday in another debate that the recruitment drive has to involve an overseas element as well.  On the points that were made in respect of the higher education Ministers, we need to have everybody working on board here.  The State, the HSE, the Department of Health and our committee here need to accept that, while this morning's meeting was a very thorough meeting, from here on we have to try to ensure we are doing something meaningful to change this.  We would hope, if their schedules allow it, to have both the Department and the HSE back here in the autumn to review this.  We need to ensure the issues that have been raised by the members today are being addressed and that the families, the children, the lives and the lived experience of people with disabilities who have been failed by the State improves from here on in.  That is what our committee and everybody here is charged with, and we hope to do that.<\/p><p> I thank sincerely the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her dedication to the job, the HSE and the officials present, our own team here, all the members of the two joint committees, and Deputy Funchion for allowing me to chair the meeting with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022060200002#T00900","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654124400,"counter":875,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 12.53 p.m. until 9.45 a.m. on Thursday, 23 June 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters","time":1654124400,"counter":876},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:40<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:40<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Holly Cairns, Tom Clonan, Se\u00e1n Canney, Erin McGreehan, Neasa Hourigan, Fiona O'Loughlin, Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, Mary Seery Kearney.

As one of the Co-Chairmen outlined, I am joined from the Department of Health by Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, Ms Deirdre Comiskey and Ms Audrey Hagerty, principal officer.<\/p> <p>   The PDS programme is one of significant reform.  Its aim is to provide equitable child and family-centred services based on need rather than diagnosis, aligned with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I firmly believe the equity the PDS programme aims for is a better approach than the previous model, whereby some children received a good service while other children received a very limited one.  Unfortunately, the transition to the 91 children's disability network teams, CDNTs, has not been smooth.  I have seen at first hand the phenomenal work the front-line clinicians are doing.  They are doing their best to support children and families, but even with 2,100 funded posts allocated to the CDNTs, such is the demand for services, as well as the recruitment issues with filling the remainder posts, that it is difficult to achieve the equity of service the PDS programme aims for.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I take full responsibility for where this policy has failed; the buck stops with me.  I acknowledge there is a perception the equity I speak of is one where we have levelled down instead of levelling up.  In my view, the PDS programme has tried to do everything at once and that simply has not worked.  To say otherwise would be disrespectful to the hundreds of parents I have met during my time as Minister of State.  Parents can see the Government's investment going in but, as many of them have told me, they do not see it translate into meaningful services on the ground.<\/p> <p>  As I said, staff are a pivotal part of the process and this is where the investment has, largely, been.  Since 2019, approximately 475 posts have been funded and allocated to children&rsquo;s disability services throughout the country.  However, while the HSE and its service providers are doing their best to recruit staff, it remains a significant challenge throughout the health and social care sector and especially so in the disabilities sector.  As a result, families are experiencing long delays in accessing crucial therapy supports for their children.  Let me be clear to the committee and any parents or clinicians watching the meeting.  I can see the policy is not working and I am trying to fix it, as are my colleagues in the HSE.  By that I mean that I as Minister of State, departmental officials, and Mr. Reid and his team in the HSE are developing a roadmap to bolster the PDS programme.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, a number of key areas need to be examined by this roadmap, that is: piloting the use of groups such as local Down&rsquo;s syndrome organisations to ease pressure on CDNTs, even if only for a defined period; the return of therapists to special schools where they have not been returned; the temporary use of private providers where CDNTs are especially strained; the temporary pausing of the individual family support plans, IFSPs, until the CDNTs have been better resourced; the expansion of the critical skills occupations list to include clinicians who could be recruited internationally; scoping out what could be done to entice undergraduates to commit to working for a CDNT after they graduate; a review of how of the national access policy is being implemented across the community healthcare organisations, CHOs; and some form of audit of how the PDS programme is being implemented throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Another key element is the need for better communication with parents.  It is vital to provide clear and timely updates to families but also to staff on all network teams.  There have clearly been instances of mixed messaging, which has left parents unnecessarily frustrated.  Wider recruitment and workforce planning is also needed to ensure not only that we attract and retain the health and social care staff required to deliver these important services but also that there will be a sufficient pipeline of graduates in the different specialties.  More generally, we need a more joined-up approach in areas such as disability and aids and appliances.  While the latter issue is not in my brief, it plays an integral part of many families lives, and while they may be already frustrated with the PDS programme, that is further compounded by what appears to be an overly burdened and slow-moving aids and appliances process, such that one family I am aware of have been waiting 16 weeks for a wheelchair and another child with complex needs has been given no access to bath support.<\/p> <p>  I am sure we will discuss this issue during the meeting but, before concluding my statement, I want to touch on the assessment of need, AON, process.  While children do not require an AON under the Disability Act to access health services, many parents continue to seek an assessment, as is their right.  On average, approximately 6,000 applications for an AON are received by the HSE annually.  One of the first initiatives I pursued as Minister of State related to the provision of &euro;7.8 million to clear a backlog of 6,500 AON applications, ensuring children who had been left waiting for an assessment would now have one.  Accordingly, as the CDNTs came online, clinicians would not be facing into a long AON backlog.  Importantly, these AONs were not completed using a preliminary team assessment, PTA.  While about 10,000 PTAs were completed while this method was in place, now, in light of the recent High Court ruling, many of these will have to be redone.  The HSE is engaging directly with the families of those who received a PTA to establish if they require a further assessment under the terms of the Disability Act.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the work the HSE is doing to revise its approach to the AON process and to ensure it will comply with the requirements of the Act while also protecting the commitment to the provision of intervention and therapeutic supports.  I am conscious of the CDNTs spending all their time carrying out assessments instead of interventions.  A balance needs to be struck and I am hopeful this can be achieved.  I also welcome any suggestions from the committee, or indeed from any clinicians or their representative groups, on an approach that works for everyone.  I am the Minister of State who is responsible for the PDS policy, and there is undoubtedly work to be done to make it work better for the children of this country.  My core objective as Minister of State with responsibility for disability is that every child have timely access to high-quality child-centred health and social care services that support each child to achieve his or her full potential, and I am sure we all share that purpose here today.  I look forward to further discussion of the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#B00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and invite Mr. Reid to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#B00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>One of the Co-Chairmen has introduced the supporting team who are with me today, so I will not read out their names again.  It is a pleasure to present to the committee along with the Minister of State.<br\/><br\/>Children with disabilities or developmental delays access health and social care services in a variety of ways.  Most of them access services such as occupational therapy, psychology or speech and language therapy through primary care services.  Children with complex needs access specialist disability services from the HSE and section 38 and section 39 providers.  Children's disability services have developed in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>manner whereby some children have received an excellent service and others have not done so.  The provision of services was inequitable and highly dependent on the child's disability, his or her age or where he or she went to school or lived.  Establishing children's disability network teams is an integral part of Sl&aacute;intecare's health reforms and is a key policy commitment in the programme for Government.  These teams will provide a better and clearer pathway with fairer access to services for all children with a disability based on their needs, utilise and fairly distribute available resources for the benefit of all children and their families and ensure effective clinical teams work in partnership with families and educational staff to support children with disabilities to reach their full potential.<\/p><p>The HSE is committed to providing high-quality and safe health and social care services to all service users, including those with disabilities and their families.  The HSE fully accepts that there are very significant challenges in current service provision, the level of unmet need and engagement and communications with service users and families.  In this regard, the HSE is committed to working with the Minister of State and all relevant stakeholders to ensure we provide appropriate supports for children with disabilities and their families. <\/p><p> At a recent meeting with the Minister and the Minister of State, the principles of the Progressing Disability Services, PDS, policy and service model were restated and agreed as the continued implementation imperative while also acknowledging that the transition to policy based CDNTs has been challenging for many families and staff.   <\/p><p> The HSE, in collaboration with departmental officials, is working to develop an overarching roadmap to support all stakeholders to support children with disabilities.  This roadmap will be completed in the coming weeks.  The document will broadly address the following key areas: communications and engagement with families-service users, Departments and relevant Ministers; reporting on CDNT activity; workforce planning; family-centred practice; education sector engagement; a process for ongoing review of the implementation of the PDS model; and assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005. <\/p><p> The Minister of State and I also attended a recent workshop involving clinicians, managers, service providers and family representatives.  This workshop is informing the development of clinical guidance to guide practitioners conducting assessment of need to take account of the recent High Court decision.  The HSE is also committed to an initiative to address the assessments required as a result of this judgement in addition to a commitment put in place earlier this year to provide 1,000 assessments for autistic children and expects to finalise the plan for this shortly. <\/p><p> HSE children's disability services have been reorganised under PDS.  The aim at the heart of PDS is to achieve fair access to services for all children with disabilities based on need.  Before this policy, children in different parts of the country with the same needs could be given much more or much less service based on geography rather than need.  This was unfair, inequitable and needed to change.  Making that happen is one of the most complex change programmes undertaken within our health service and while we have made good progress, we have a lot more to do before it is complete. <\/p><p> The HSE is facing some specific challenges in CDNTs, including a high level of staff vacancies and a limited employment market, large caseloads and long waiting lists and the legislative focus on assessment rather than intervention.  Recruitment is a major challenge across the health system including in disability services.  The HSE is progressing all available options to secure the necessary staff and we can further elaborate on actions we are taking to recruit staff.  We recognise that difficulties accessing services create additional stress for families.  Our programme of reform is intended to ensure that children have timely access to services based on their needs.  The HSE regrets the negative experience of families where the current service may fall short of what is required to meet the needs of their children.  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":888,"content":"<p>It is really important that we are here together to discuss this really important issue.  It is one of the most common issues we come across as public representatives.  Exhausted families and children with unmet needs come to us begging for help.  This issue is not just about unmet needs or waiting lists.  It is actually a human rights, quality of life and opportunities in life issue.  It is frustrating, heartbreaking, infuriating and relentless.  There is an inability on the part of the HSE to care for our most vulnerable children.  Mr. Reid calls them children with disabilities but in fact, the inability of the organisation to care, see and treat our children is making their disability far worse.  Every delay and unmet need create relentless pressure for families.  Our children are wonderful and capable and it is the services' responsibility to help those abilities shine bright but we are not doing that.  The HSE is not doing that.<\/p> <p>  There are many issues I wish to raise.  It is really upsetting because we sit in front of mammies and see these gorgeous children in front of us.

Is this not a contradiction?  Is it appropriate for the HSE clinical lead for disability to have a blog with commentary on Ms Justice Phelan's recent ruling on the assessment of need, including the statement that her judgement departed from best practice and conveyed an inadequate understanding regarding diagnosis and disability?  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#C00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I applaud the Minister of State's extremely hard and diligent work and how accessible her office is.  Noel Byrne is a saint.  He is just fantastic.  Last week, the Joint Committee on Disability Matters heard from Helen Holmes from the Campaign for Autism Inclusion Dublin 12.  Among the many issues she raised, she discussed the issues in CHO 7 where there are two CDNTS - one in Dublin 8 and the other in Dublin 12.  It was at the public meeting with the Minister of State that it came out that the HSE was refusing to attend those meetings.  The staffing for these two network teams is at an extremely low level.  There is a worrying turnover of staff.  Between the two, there is a vacancy for three psychologists, two psychotherapists, two speech and language therapists, one occupational therapist and one dietician.  Staff sick leave is not covered, the effect on any continuity of services to children is devastating and when staff renews, the service to the child must start over to accommodate the knowledge transfer to new hires.  A total of 56% of affected families in Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 are without any services.  Of those who have services, 20% have had only one initial meeting, 8% are attending a parent course and the children of 16% are attending play therapy interventions.  It is an appalling crisis for children and their families and, therefore, it would certainly appear that the recruitment model is not fit for purpose and the resources are not being targeted where the need is felt.<\/p> <p>  There is a complete dearth of metrics.  This leads on to the issue of child places in school.  If we have not done an assessment of need and do not have the metrics on the sheer level of need among children because they are not being engaged in services, how are they going to be properly placed in schools and how are there going to be proper placements in schools or in the right schools?  It has a knock-on effect way beyond that.  <\/p> <p>  Last February, Mr. Reid very kindly took a call from me regarding a one-parent family with a terminally ill child with complex needs.  He was fantastic, as was the response from the team.  However, the mother was in a situation where her child had come home after a brief respite in hospice care.  Insufficient nursing hours were allocated to her and most nights, she was nursing her child alone in the middle of night.  The child is not young and has serious needs.  The additional nursing hours had to go out to tender rather than the service in which the child was engaged being extended because of governance issues with the agency nurses.  There was an expectation that the nurses would transfer from one service to another to provide the additional hours, which is in complete disregard of those nurses' employment rights.<\/p><p>They were expected to relinquish their service, but that is a whole other issue.  We are in the month of June.  The agency that won the tender has still not supplied the nurses to the mother.  The child has a life-limiting condition, and only has weeks or months - at the most - to live.  The mother is still caring for the child.  When the nurse did show up for partial cover of those hours, she could not be left alone.  The mother could not even go to the shop.  All other support for the family has to be provided by neighbours.  To be perfectly honest, the system is a disgrace.  I applaud parents for their dignity and the fact that they are not more vocal and extreme.  Ms Helen Holmes came in here last week and was so dignified in her responses and her contribution.  The situation is appalling.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth a number of months ago, we heard that it is going to take years for the recruitment issue to be fixed.  That is just appalling for the children who need the care in the here and now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#C00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I will make some general comments, then I might refer to some members of my team to comment on the specifics.

I can see the inconsistencies.  I know what good looks like and I know where it has worked well.  I can also see where it has not worked well.  In response to the points raised by Senator McGreehan, I wish to state that everybody working in the service cares a lot.  People who are directly engaged with service users and those sitting alongside me today care.  They work night and day to make people's lives and the lives of families better.  We do care.  I want to put that on the record.  I am not trying to be defensive, but I wish to restate that we care a lot.  I also acknowledge that the transition has not gone well.  There are major gaps in policy that we are trying to close to get to where we want to be.<\/p> <p>  On the points raised on the Disability Act, I appeared before an Oireachtas committee alongside the Ombudsman for Children.  At that meeting, we made the point that there are inconsistencies and challenges around the Act, particularly in terms of our own roles and responsibilities and the roles and responsibilities of education.  The ombudsman has produced a report that recommends certain changes be made to the Act.  We agree with many of the recommendations that he has made.  We are not criticising a policy or an Act, but we are highlighting where we believe it can be made better.  We will be making submissions - and we have made submissions - to strengthen the Act and to make people's lives better.  I will refer to members of my team to respond to the points made on the workshop that we held.<\/p> <p>  In response to the points raised by Senator Seery Kearney, I will not comment on the individual case she referenced.  I know the Senator is not asking me to do that.  We have to be compliant with procurement procedures.  There have been occasions when we have gone to procurement for suppliers.  We have to find that balance of pragmatism and compliance with procurement procedures where we have to fill a gap in between.  The case to which the Senator referred highlights the need for a level of pragmatism in between compliance with procurement processes.  We have experienced and know for a fact that there are recruitment challenges not just for the HSE, but also for service providers.  A large part of the model of delivery of major disability services in particular is driven through section 39 organisations.  We know that there are gaps in funding models at Government policy level.  There are fundamental issues that the sector has to address.  Today, I will concentrate on what the HSE has to address.  However, gaps have been identified at a Government policy level.  <\/p> <p>  Specifically on the issue of recruitment, as we have discussed with the Minister, we are probably going to have to look at different ways of recruiting staff.  I am not just referring to recruitment in the market.  We are going to have to look at what levels we are bringing people in at, and what qualifications are required to being people in at a particular level.  We will have to look at that differently.  There are some examples of other healthcare providers bringing people in with different qualifications, enabling them to get experience and then upscale.  That is something that we are discussing with the Minister and some of the third level education providers.  We want to increase the pipeline of people coming through to the service.  The Minister has engaged with our colleagues in the other relevant Departments, including the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I will refer to members of the team to comment on specifics, but generally, we have committed to filling the 28% gap that exists in respect of vacant positions.  Looking at recruitment to the HSE over the past two years, we have recruited a total of 35,000 people.  That is a net increase of 14,800.  We need to recruit 9,500 people every year just to stand still due to the turnover of staff.  That is just natural turnover from people leaving on pensions and people leaving the service.  The net increase of 14,800 staff represents the biggest recruitment in the history of the HSE since its establishment.  However, it is still not enough for the service demands that we have.  Recruitment is a real challenge for the disability services sector, in particular.  We are going to have to look at it differently and look relentlessly at the numbers being recruited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":892,"content":"<p>How many of the 35,000 people recruited in the past two years were recruited to do Covid-related work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#D00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":893,"content":"<p>Some 3,800 of the staff were recruited for Covid-related work, including testing, tracing and vaccination.

I really welcome them because it gives me an opportunity to talk about something which I think is very important.  The clinical programme was established to implement the UNCRPD.  As the Senator has highlighted, it is about rights, opportunities and so on.  It is not a programme which is narrowly technocratic and just sets out the clinical processes that should be used.  It is a programme that looks to the UNCRPD and compares it to what happens in the Irish context, and considers how it should be different.  The Senator referred to Ms Justice Phelan's comments on the assessment of need.  The implications of her judgment have to be addressed so that we are legally compliant within the HSE.  That is why we held a workshop.  We will ensure that we are compliant.  At the same time, it will reduce our ability to provide the interventions which we have just heard are so lacking.  It will reduce that opportunity, and in doing so it will increase clinical risk.  If I am the clinical lead of a programme whose function is to ensure the rights of people accessing services, I feel I would be running away from my responsibilities not to point out how the implementation of an Act results in increased clinical risk.  That does not mean that we are not going to comply with it.  Of course, we will comply with it.  We have to comply with it because it is the law.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, I want to strongly advocate for a change in the law.  I must say that I find it frustrating.  I have mentioned previously in this House that sections 3 to 13 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act have never been commenced.  That is not our fault or the fault of the Department of Education.  It is the responsibility of the Oireachtas.  The Disability Act predates the UNCRPD.  It is well-voiced that the Act should be revised.  It is nonsensical to revise the EPSEN Act and not to revise the Disability Act at the same time.  I am not going to hide my frustration with the idea that the Government is thinking that the clinical programme for disability should be looking at narrow clinical interventions, rather than trying to address the fundamental issues that are causing the problem.  The fundamental issues are structural issues which the Oireachtas should be addressing.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, the issues concern the pipeline of supply of professionals to be able to provide the service, and an Act that is no longer fit for purpose, according to the ombudsman.<\/p><p>They are also to do with an Act that is no longer fit for purpose according to the Ombudsman.  I recently returned from Malawi, where I was involved in the revision of the disability legislation there, which people considered way out of date.  It was put in place in 2011.  Ours is way more out of date.  I would appeal to committee members as legislators to make their contribution to addressing these issues by revising the Disability Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":896,"content":"<p>I will make comments on several other issues raised.

We have signed contracts and work is under way.  We will commence rolling out a system in the third quarter of this year and it will be fully rolled out next year.  It will be critical for us to gather data.  In this day and age it is not okay that we rely on an annual collection of data with all of the challenges for people inputting and collating it and the time it takes given the importance of the timeliness and accuracy of data.  It is an important development for us for all of the reasons the Senator set out.  We absolutely agree.<\/p> <p>  As the meeting goes on this following point may be discussed.  Mr. Reid and the Minister of State referenced the work being done to develop a roadmap.  It will be completed in the coming weeks.  The intention is that it will be very specific on what it sets out and it will be very clear on the short- and medium-term actions that will be required.  It is something that will be communicated to all stakeholders, especially families, so they know exactly what they can expect from the services in the next three to six months or year.  There will be very clear commitments.  This does not take away from challenges that exist for us.  They are very real and we have to face them in balancing meeting our legal obligations on assessments of need while at the same time making sure children get the interventions they need.  We need to manage this with the resources that are there and establish how we increase resourcing capacity.

In her speech the Minister of State said the buck stops with her regarding the failure in the delivery of disability services.  The buck also stops with the HSE because it is tasked with the delivery of these services.  The Joint Committee on Disability Matters is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the UNCRPD.  I state here that the HSE is in violation of the convention.  Article 25 states health services needed by persons with disabilities specifically because of their disabilities are to be provided, including early identification and intervention as appropriate along with services to try to minimise and prevent further disabilities.  This is not happening.  I do not know whether the witnesses realise the stress families and children go through due to the lack of services.  Parents have told me the lack of services being provided is the difference between people living independently or in residential care.  If we were to look at it in a cold-hearted way, we would ask what will be the cost of this down the line.  The cost of not providing early intervention now will come back and cost a lot more later.  This is just in money terms and not in human terms.<\/p> <p>  According to the HSE's census of the children's disability network teams, there 524.5 vacancies.  This is an average of 28% across all of the teams but it goes as high as 33% on some teams.  I believe there is only one team that is fully staffed.  Perhaps there are two teams.  A total of 90 people on maternity leave have not been replaced.  There are teams without administrative support, family support workers or play therapists.  The teams cannot function.  They cannot provide the services they are supposed to provide.  This has to be down to a lack of workplace planning.  In 2014 the national model of care for paediatric healthcare services had a guide to workforce planning that included Progressing Disability Services.  Eight years later the teams do not function.  There are very big problems.  The witnesses have identified them and identified what they will do.  Why was this not done before it was rolled out?<\/p> <p>  Section 39 was mentioned.  What has been done to address the pay differential between section 39 organisations and the HSE?  Until this is addressed, we will see staff continue to leave section 39 organisations and go to alternatives.  Enable Ireland and many organisations will not be able to retain their staff or to deliver their services.<\/p> <p>  We have huge problems with CORU and the length of time it takes to recognise qualifications, particularly of those who have qualified overseas.  I have been contacted by many speech and language therapists who qualified in jurisdictions such as the UK but they are being refused recognition because of one thing not included in their qualification.  Could this not be provided to them when they are in the job if needed?  This is a sector in crisis and these issues need to be addressed now.  I am extremely concerned about the children who need services now.  They cannot wait.<\/p> <p>  The HSE's recruitment process is cumbersome.  There is a panel system.  Nobody agrees with the panel system.  Why can the children's disability network teams not recruit locally?  It would make an awful lot more sense.  It was mentioned that 35,000 people will be recruited to the HSE.  How many of these will be clinical staff or therapists as opposed to administrative staff?  Have there been trade fairs overseas to attract recruitment into this area?  Has there been enough discussion with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on ensuring enough people are qualified at third level?  Have we looked at an allocation allowance similar to that provided to ICU nurses to encourage people to work in disability services?  Unfortunately disability services have a bad name and many clinicians do not opt to work in the service.  They go to child and adult mental health services, primary care or the private sector.  There needs to be encouragement for them to work in this area.  Other jurisdictions used qualifications such as therapy assistant.  Has this been considered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#E00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":900,"content":"<p>All of us are aware parents are at breaking point.  There is no question about it.  I have spoken to many parents in my area.  The lack of services and the effect this has on children has affected the parents.  We are inclined to speak about Covid and bring everything back to it.  This is unacceptable.  I met with representatives of CHO 5 recently and I had a very good discussion on the serious concerns I am addressing for parents.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I hear one thing from her and another thing from CHO 5.  With regard to funding and resource planning, will the Minister of State and the HSE discuss how demographic change will be addressed and how the current gaps in the service provision will be tackled to meet the demographic and unmet needs?  There is a very big issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister of State and the HSE discuss how they will work collaboratively to provide a service that enables meaningful early intervention to be applied consistently and enables it to include respite intervention?<\/p><p>One of the areas I feel has been totally neglected is respite, in particular overnight respite.  I know Covid was a concern in that regard.  In Carlow, and also in Wexford, some day respite is being provided and I believe that is working well.  It is important that we get more information on that.  It is good that at least there is some support as we need to address the challenges.<\/p><p> It is important that there is joined-up thinking, which I do not believe is the case at present.  I will give an example.  I am working with a lot of families at the moment, but I will not highlight one.  I am working with families where the children urgently need an adaptation grant for a bathroom.  I went to the council with the families and an occupational therapist was sent out, but the decision was that the grant would not be provided.  The families in question then got a private occupational therapist to do a report, which was sent to the council.  In one case the private occupational therapist said the child needed a bathroom adaptation grant.  However, the council said it was not within its remit.  It says \"No\".  I cannot understand how we have a system that is so broken that there is no joined-up thinking at all.  The only ones who are suffering are the beautiful children.  That is a concern for me.  I have met so many parents, as all of us here have.  We are all very passionate about this because we know the effect it has had on children and their families, yet we do not seem to be resolving it.<\/p><p> I want to get an update on the waiting lists across all the therapies and the plan for the elimination of waiting lists and early intervention.  What is the HSE's plan going forward?  I regularly work with the Minister of State, and she has always come back to me and done the best she could.  However, I feel we have no planning going forward.  We cannot tell a parent what the plan is, show where the money will be invested or say they will get their services.  I am working with parents who are waiting to have their child assessed for a school place but, again, there is a two-year waiting list.  Therefore, the child could miss out on a place in school.  That is absolute neglect.  I know we can make all the apologies we want, but at the end of the day we must make sure that we look after the children that need help.  We must also remember their families that are so stressed and tormented about their children.  We are trying to work with them.  Going forward, I want to know what is the plan for the Minister and the HSE so that we can go back to the parents and say we are going to find solutions here.  There is funding and we just need to have common sense.  Sometimes I believe common sense is not being applied.  In terms of joined-up thinking with the various stakeholders, everybody must be working in unison to make sure that services are being provided, whether that is a bathroom adaptation grant or a sensory room, which is another significant issue that arises.  Children need sensory rooms.  Reports exist saying they need them.  We must ensure that children with a disability who need a sensory room or bathroom adaptation grant get them, but they seem to be falling through the cracks.  I would welcome some answers to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#E00600","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleagues to come in on some of the specifics.

I do not disagree with what the Deputy said about looking at new ways of addressing the issue.  I touched on some of it earlier.  I will let the Minister of State comment on it, but I know the Minister has met with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and other Ministers on how we might approach things differently.<\/p> <p>  Pay and the differential rate for those in section 39 organisations is not something the HSE can address.  It is a pay policy issue, and it is not within our remit.  I met with section 39 providers last night, so we are connecting on this.  Retention is increasingly becoming an issue for service providers.  It is a very significant issue, but it is not within our remit.<\/p> <p>  I will let Mr. Bernard O'Regan address some of the questions on the CDNTs.

We can give the Deputy a table showing the breakdown of recruitment in the disability area.  I accept that it is still a significant issue.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general point again in terms of the recruitment and retention of staff, and I ask that members please take it the way it is meant.  We all have a role in retaining staff in the HSE.  Every day I meet staff in this and other areas who care a lot.  Sometimes it is very difficult to work in the health service and also to retain staff because the amount of public pressure they are under is significant.  Recruitment must happen.  I accept there is public accountability, but we all have a role to play in retaining staff within the sector.  It is a great sector and the people who work in it are highly committed to it.  I meet many of them regularly.  I want to say that again because sometimes the public perception is that staff do not care.  Our staff care hugely.  They want this fixed as much as members, as parliamentarians, want it fixed.

Some are section 39s, and the pay differential is a major challenge for them.  Some are section 38s and they have the same terms and conditions as HSE staff, but they are experiencing some difficulties in recruitment as well.  They are smaller and perhaps they have more agility than the HSE might have.  It is just reflecting some of the reality of the pool of people that we are drawing from, notwithstanding the fact that we do need to be as innovative and imaginative as possible and to explore every possibility in terms of recruitment, including the points Deputy Tully mentioned such as the use of assistant therapy posts.  That is something that we are working on at the moment and it will be included in the action plan.  We have already given some clarification to the CHOs that they can use assistant grades wherever possible, on the basis that it is an agreed and useful way, first, to bring people into the teams and, second, to invest in people who might stay for the long term and address some of the retention issues.

For instance, there could be two occupational therapists who have exactly the same training and years of experience, and they are paid quite differently.  As the committee knows, over the last number of years, but more specifically over the last year, huge work has been done by disability operations in standing up these children's disability network teams.  That is being done within the structures we have and it has been very difficult.  The national pay policy is another area which it would be very important at a national policy level to address because that is the only way in which we are going to address that sort of inequality.  That inequality will result in people leaving, given they are going to get cheesed off if someone with the same experience is earning more.

The census was conducted last October and some recruitment has taken place since, but I also secured last October an additional 180 posts which are added on to that, so the actual figure is 714 unfilled posts, to put that in context.<\/p><p>The Deputy is right in regard to the CORU piece and this is something I and my team have taken up directly with CORU.  There have been very good conversations between myself, Mr. O'Regan and his team around how we should look at the various people who are trained abroad.  Mr. Reid&rsquo;s opening statement referred to how we should look at that.  In a particular CHO area, Edel Quinn in Donegal always talks about the speech and language therapists being trained in Derry yet, at the same time, they cannot come and work on her teams because there is a module or two that is missing.  We need to see how we can bring those speech and language therapists to work on our teams while squaring it, or perhaps making the<b><\/b>circle a little bit rounder, so they can be part of our teams while also meeting the requirements of CORU.  That is just an example of it.  If we have that agile approach, we could shorten that gap an awful lot quicker because the three largest areas that we are trying to recruit into are occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy  To be honest with the Deputy, it is very difficult to fill those posts, not just in disability but in primary care as well.  We have to find an alternative.<\/p><p>The other piece where I have seen that has worked very well within mental health &ndash; Ms Yvonne O'Neill was involved in this - concerned the assistant psychologist posts.  We need to see that come across to the disability side as well in regard to recruiting assistant psychologists.  Creating different pathways and a pathway for employment and career opportunities within disability is not just all about staff seniority in that there have to be other mechanisms and entry points.  At the moment, we cannot provide the opportunity for students training in third level colleges to be on any of our teams due to the clinical risk because our teams are not full.  Therefore, we cannot even give the opportunity for young people to see what it is like to work within disability because we do not have a proper clinical opportunity currently and we cannot achieve that until we fill out our teams.  If that was available, there would be another entry point in third year and fourth year to show what disability would be like.  Those are the opportunities and that is the roadmap which, since 11 May, the HSE and I are working on to try to find how we can actually work this out.  It is not just one level; it is not one-size-fits-all.  We need to look at a multitude of areas in order to attract and retain staff.  I also believe that until such time as we get to the space where we can give that opportunity to have experience of working with persons within disability services, it will never be that attractive, and we do not have that opportunity in regard to entry points at the moment.<\/p><p>Mr. O&rsquo;Regan touched on the disability action plan.  That is with me at present and we are in the final stages of engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on it.  It is a huge document overall and it is a ten-year plan.  I am going to bite it off in three-year bites so it can be measurable and deliverable.  That is the most important thing.  Hopefully, that will help to build in the capacity in regard to what we are looking to achieve within it, but also in regard to building capacity in respite and residential services, which is very important.<\/p><p>Deputy Murnane O'Connor referred to respite in her CHO area.  It is important to realise that respite funding was provided for her area and the house is there.  They have gone to recruit twice for the person in charge &ndash; or PIC, as it is called - and although the contract has been awarded and everything else, they cannot recruit that PIC.  It is sitting there since before Christmas and we want to open that service.  I have done my job and the HSE has operationalised it, but we cannot recruit because that last link is the person in charge.  That is where the Deputy will find an issue in her area.  At the same time, &euro;40,000 for overnight respite was also put in to support some of the families.  The Deputy also talked about the teams in her areas and I was fortunate last week to meet with people in CHO 5.<\/p><p>While we are talking about section 38 and 39 organisations, I am informed that documents will go to Cabinet next week to address some parts of this.  I am not saying it is all disability but it is looking at section 39s, so that conversation is there and I have had this conversation with the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  We need to have that conversation around making it a level playing field.  If someone is in the canteen of a PDS team, it will have HSE, section 38 and section 39 staff.  We knew at the start that this was always going to be problematic, and recruitment is the issue.  I also want to show the Deputy that it is not just section 39s that have the problem, by any manner or means.  When I look at the various teams across a network, 23% of HSE teams have a vacancy.<\/p><p>The HSE team in network 2 also has a 28% vacancy.  Enable, which is a section 39 organisation, has a 9% vacancy.  There is another 20% vacancy rate in the HSE, and the figures go on and on.  The greatest vacancy level, in network 6, stands at 54%, and this is a HSE team.  Therefore, it is not just the section 39 organisations that cannot recruit.  This problem being experienced right across the board.  This is why there is a willingness on both sides of the House to work together to find a pathway forward in this regard.  We must have various entry points.  I say that because what we have done in the past is not working.  We must be far more agile in our approach.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#G00800","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":917,"content":"<p>I welcome this meeting and the witnesses coming before us.  Starting with the individual family support plans, I had a parliamentary question on this issue answered by Mr. O'Regan.  It was dated 24 May 2022.  In that question, I asked the Minister of Health the number of individualised family service plans issued and accepted by each CDNT, broken down by CHO area.  The response I got was that the individual family support plan process is a live one, in that the team and family keep it under review while service supports and strategies are being implemented and as the needs and achievements of the child and family change.  Is the output of the individual family support plans being measured as this process is being rolled out?

The experiences of families of which I am aware, whether we like it or not, reflect a lack of confidence in the service.  Families are afraid that they are being sent down yet another road and to another service that they must sign up to get access to services.  I am not going to be rhetorical.  I just ask the HSE to be mindful of this point and if it can do that, it would be good.  We know what the experiences of families are.  We all know they are jaded now.  Let us take that as a given.  We all accept that.  If I dovetail the individual family support plan process now with the creation of the CDNTs, then this is again about measurement.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Ms O'Neill, another parliamentary question I submitted asked \"the number of children that have been transferred from Children's Disability Network Team back to primary care on foot of assessments since April 2021, by age, CHO and LHO in tabular form and general categorisation for such a transfer back to primary care operations\".  Ms O'Neill's response to me stated, \"Though there is no specific timeline on when the system will be available, I can confirm that there has been a procurement process and the system is now at the development stage.\"  Again, we do not have a live measurement of the families' experience as they are going through the system.  They are again being asked to sign up to a CDNT process and they are wondering how many more arguably bureaucratic processes they will have to go through before they can get access to the speech and language therapist, SLT, the occupational therapist, OT, the psychologist and all the therapy services.  Do the witnesses appreciate where I am coming from in this regard?  We must ensure that parents and children are minded in this context.  The bottom line in all of this is still access to the services, notwithstanding all the issues we are talking about here concerning recruitment, which is, effectively, the big elephant in the room.  I just want to hear from witnesses from the HSE that they are going to be careful and mindful of families in this process.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#H00400","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I would like to comment quickly first and then Ms O'Neill can-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard O'Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I am happy for Ms O'Neill to answer because she replied with the letter responding to my parliamentary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#H00600","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I am happy to answer the Deputy's question.  The answer to the question is the position on the procurement of the system.  I refer to having a line of sight regarding what a family has access to or, more importantly, what they do not have access to, being critical to us in how we offer services and how we join up services.  We must respect that a child is a child and a service user first and that may be the case in respect of a range of requirements, running from the least to the most complex.  It is critical, as Mr. O'Regan referred to earlier, in respect of the system, for us to be able to have that line of sight.  In a way, this helps to try to keep the family and the child at the centre of how we offer services.  It is difficult.  We see a million children each year.  Therefore, it is very difficult with paper-based systems to be able to respond to a query like that parliamentary question.  When such a question is asked, it pains me not to be able to give the Deputy the types of data at the level he would like to see them, because that is the position we are trying to get to.

If I am reading Mr. Reid and the Minister of State correctly concerning the need to address the imbalance here on the pay parity side, there is a responsibility, and I say this respectfully, on the Government to engage with the trade unions and the representatives of employees to address this subject.  I say this because, and the Co-Chair will attest to this, we have a facility in north County Cork, namely, St. Joseph's Foundation located at Cooleens House, and every time I submit a parliamentary question - and there is a plethora of them now -  the response I get back refers to the problem of recruitment and being unable to recruit.  My fear is that what has happened is that people have moved over from one service to another, because, whether people like it or not, there is this perception that there is this type of Darwinian system where the HSE has recruited and taken on people from section 38 and 39 organisations because of better terms and conditions.

When I am sitting and thinking about access to services, I think back to trying to access them myself for children with additional needs.  That was the case with my children when I had no capital or way to navigate the system.  I have since experienced trying to navigate the system with capital.  It is interesting to have been in both of those spaces and to have seen just how different those experiences have been.  This is why I wish to focus my contribution on the cohort of people who are not even making it onto the waiting lists for services, because there are many of them.  Mr. Reid spoke about the provision of services being inequitable and this being dependent on a children's disability, age, school and where they live.<\/p><p>I would like to hone in a little bit more on the school and where they live.  These can often come with many different assumptions and biases.  I suppose it is a cultural issue within the professional class.  I support many women - there are some men, but it is mostly women - who have experienced addiction in their lifetimes or who have experienced social service input into their families at some point in time.  Many of them are being completely ignored when they try to access services, especially for invisible disabilities.  For an obvious disability, it might be a little easier.<\/p><p> Many of the women who I support, of which there are currently a few, have spent ten or 12 years trying to get someone to just believe that their child may be autistic or may need psychology services.  It is constantly being suggested to them that this is a parenting issue.  There is a bias that arises from where they are from, where they live or the experiences they have had in life.<\/p><p> How we can begin to create an equitable service if there is a cohort of people within it who do not even understand the experience that people have when they are just trying to enter that space and navigate that world for themselves?  Sometimes the judgment is so much that they lock themselves away.  They fear trying to access services in case they put themselves on the radar of judgment or stigma.  How do we create a fairer system?  Mr. O&rsquo;Regan spoke about raising all boats.  However, if there are some boats that we do not even know need our support, how do we reach them?  Maybe this is a question for the Minister of State as well.  How do we create those advocacy supports at that base level, even in addiction services, and not only in primary care?  How do we go about looking at what already exists in family resource centres and in addiction services?  How do we place disability advocate supports there, so that people can get supports wherever they access services?  That is one question.<\/p><p> My other question is on metrics and it more for my understanding.  What type of data is the HSE collecting, and for what purpose?  Is this only to look at the waiting lists?  What type of data is collected?  I understand how important data collection is for efficiency and for understanding what we are dealing with.  I am also cautious about how we continue to build and use data in a way that will replace the human emotional intelligence in terms of how we assess people.  Is the Department looking at the use of AI in relation to any disability services?  If it is, is that underpinned by AI ethics?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#H01500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I will start and then maybe Professor MacLachlan and Ms O&rsquo;Neill might come in.  The Senator raised the question of the data that we have collected on family-centred plans, as well as the development of the systems around it.  It is important to say that, fundamentally, the idea and principle behind a family-centred plan is simple.  It is to sit with a family to ask them what is the priority for their child and how we align the services towards it.  Any system we develop in terms of the metrics around that is a management information tool.  The point should not be to tick boxes.  The point needs to be around how we engage with families.  The system we are trying to develop will be around the outcomes that flow from that, as opposed to ticking boxes.  From a principle point of view, that underpins the approach that we are trying to take.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a point on how we grow an equitable service if there are people we do not even know we should be talking to and considering.  This is fundamental to progressing children&rsquo;s disability services policy.  This is about how we try to work towards an equitable service for everybody.  We are engaging with colleagues across services under Ms O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s remit to try to have joined up thinking around services for children.  We are also working with colleagues in mental health services, primary care services and in social inclusion to work towards services for children.  Those with disabilities are one group, but there are other children who have needs as well.  We need to have as much integration and coherence as is possible.  That is a work in progress.  It is on our radar.  The point the Senator made about possible unintentional or otherwise does not matter.  If people are excluded from accessing services, or if they do not have the capital to be able to even engage with the system, then whatever other failings are there as well, that is a complete failure.  This should not be about whether or not a person has that capital.

There is no doubt that across the healthcare service there are huge inequities, including for people from working class and disadvantaged areas.  I come from Finglas west.  I grew up seeing disadvantage in access to healthcare.  It still exists.  It breaks my heart that it exists.  Certainly, the driver of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, PDS, was to try to get that balance.<\/p> <p>  In their experience of PDS, some people have found that they have lost some aspects of services.  The driver was to try to rebalance and provide services for those who have them.  I think 643,000 people, or 13.5% of the population, indicated in the last census that they have an illness that would indicate a disability.  That is a significant number.  One will find that a significant proportion of that figure may not even be identified, in areas such as Senator Ruane expressed.  We saw this during Covid-19 in vaccinations programmes and who was coming through.  This was not because they did not want a vaccination, but it was an issue of awareness.  High presentations of Covid-19 illness was in areas of high disadvantage.  These were primarily in urban centres, as well as in areas of high disadvantage across the country.  There are inequities.  As the CEO, I am passionate about this.  Government policy is there to give equal access to services.  It is a relentless policy.  I know when we are failing.  Sometimes I do not know when we are failing, because we do not see it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for the question.  It goes to the heart of what the whole PDS reform is about, which is about providing services on an equity basis.  This, of course, does not mean on an equality basis, but that the people who most need the services get the sorts of services they need to give them the same opportunities.  In terms of people not making it onto the waiting list, that would be a real concern.  I would love to know more about that.  We had a meeting yesterday where we were told that in one of the CHOs, 40% of the kids on the waiting list there were previously, prior to reconfiguration, not on any waiting lists.  Being on a waiting list is not what we want.  We want people to be getting an intervention.  However, they had previously been invisible to the service.  They are now an increased demand on the service, but at least they are on its radar.  Therefore, if there are people who continue to not be on its radar, we would be keen to know more about that.<\/p> <p>  The idea that parents are being blamed and that it is being suggested that it is a parenting issue is absolutely wrong.  It is one of the rationales for the individual family plans, so that it is not a matter of clinicians saying what your child needs.  It is a matter of working with the family to find out what important outcomes would be, etc.  If that is not working effectively, we would love to know that.<\/p> <p>  Many healthcare professionals come from very middle-class backgrounds.  They are often not very skilled in interacting with people from different cultural perspectives and so on.  We would like to target that.<\/p> <p>  On the idea of allocation of staff to children's disability network teams, CDNTs, we looked at that this year on the basis of population versus the number of therapists available within the teams.  We want to move to looking at, for instance, social gradients within the different catchment areas.  This is because we know the incidents of difficulties around disability are very much associated with socio-economic class and opportunity.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  That is an area where there is huge opportunity and a real opportunity for Ireland given we have so many digital multinationals located here.  The Global Report on Assistive Technology was launched recently and I am delighted the Minister of State was able to go to Geneva for that launch.  One of the reasons Ireland has such an interest in that area is we recognise the opportunity of digital and AI to address some of the social inequities not by replacing human contact but by being better able to target them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":936,"content":"<p>It is not just about the social inequities but about how the machine learns, and the ethics in that, so it does not reinforce inequalities, in some sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#K00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":937,"content":"<p>That is right, so it is not fed with mainstream data which further marginalises people----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Malcolm MacLachlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":938,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#K00400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":939,"content":"<p>-----who are not in the mainstream.

I would like to hear from Mr. Reid about how the HSE intends to grasp the nettle on that one and where the Minister of State is then as far as ensuring we have parity is concerned.  Deputy Tully was here earlier and opened up with that very point.  We need to address that point.

I meet section 39 organisations all the time but I was at something throughout Mayo and Galway and the Minister of State's constituency in the past few days.  Last night I met a section 39 provider in the area of mental health.  I was just referencing the provider was making the point about losing staff or trying to retain staff or maybe staff being cannibalised within the sector.  That is a factor.  Sometimes we are cannibalising within the HSE and sometimes we are cannibalising across the sector.  The Minister of State has touched on this and has brought forward some views through Government channels and that is where those things go.  We are experiencing it.<\/p> <p>  The market at the moment in the health sector is extremely tight.  One of the members asked earlier about whether we should go overseas.  We have had expos in Manchester and London.  We have feet on the street in India trying to recruit in terms of nursing.  We are looking at all kinds of innovative ways of doing it but the world market for health sector professionals, especially in this sector, is very significant.  On a positive note, I met a significant number in the past 48 hours around the west and north west and we are seeing more people coming back from overseas as well such as speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  They now are seeing full-time contracts coming into the community.  We are seeing a lot more people coming back.  The fear is always, and the expectation is, that we are losing people overseas but I was pleasantly surprised to see; I met a lot of people who have come back from the UK yesterday and over the past 48 hours.  However, pay, which the Deputy touched on, is a factor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":944,"content":"<p>What about my question on the files?

One of the roles of the manager of the team is to manage and co-ordinate the service being provided under his or her remit.

However, given the challenges that are there with staffing levels within teams, the capacity for other people on the team to pick up additional work is very limited.

What have I done?  In the last month I met FEDVOL and the team, including Alison Harnett, about pay.  It was solely about pay around the section 39s.  The figure for pay restoration is &euro;20 million.  That is required.  Now I will hand it over to the relevant.  I know where I am in the asking process but I will hand it over to the relevant.  Pay is a policy issue for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but I know from a disability point of view what the cost is.  In my first budget I did pay restoration and I allocated &euro;10 million for that.  I have started it and do not intend to stop without having equality.  As the Minister of State going into the Department with responsibility for equality I believe in that equality across all of it.<\/p> <p>  It is important to say sometimes when we talk about the PDS teams and the number of HSE and the other leads on it, we might think everything is all section 39s, whereas is it is not.  Eight of the teams are section 38 and four of them are section 39.  It is important to contextualise that but it is a wider issue.  The Deputy talked about Cooleens House.  It has six rooms and provides enormous capacity to provide respite in north Cork.  The issue there, yet again, like with what I said in reply to Deputy Murnane O'Connor, is the recruitment of the person in charge, PIC.  They are able to find staff within the framework and that is exactly what we have in west Cork in the Beara Breifne.  The reason the house had to be closed was we could not find a PIC.  We are now identifying why respite might not be functioning and that is two houses I have note of in Cork, with one in the north and one in the south and it is to do with the PIC.  Earlier this year I met the F&oacute;rsa-SIPTU-INMO congress at one particular meeting.  I can tell members I knew my objective coming out of it, let us put it like that.  That was about the section 39s.  They play a phenomenal role.  I have asked Ms Harnett from FEDVOL if she can tell me the difference between the work the section 39s do and the section 38s and the HSE and there is no difference in the work or the delivery of the work that they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#K01200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am sorry that what I am going to say is not going to be pleasant but I am sure they have heard it all before.<\/p> <p>  The reason I am here is the dysfunction in the services.  I have a son who I speak about with his permission as he is very anxious I speak about this.  He is now 20 years of age.  You have failed him.  He has not received any meaningful physiotherapy, speech therapy or occupational therapy since 2011.  That is when it started, namely, with the crash and the austerity cuts that were imposed by some of the Deputies here.  A virtue was made of inflicting pain on people who were the most vulnerable in Irish society.  I spoke to Enda Kenny in 2011 and begged him as a parent: \"Do not impose any more cuts on persons with disabilities or carers\".  He said he could not give me that undertaking.  He told me this is a private matter between me and my son and that the State could not be expected to intervene meaningfully in the lives of persons with disabilities.  That is the ideological imperative that has brought us to this space.  My son receives no physiotherapy - none.  The only physiotherapy he has received in the past ten years was to measure his deterioration.  It is a struggle to get a wheelchair.  Would you please ask your staff to staff to stop revoking our medical card?  Would you please ask your staff to staff to stop revoking our public services card with his companion for travel?<\/p><p>The obstacles that have been put in front of families like mine add insult to the injury that has already been inflicted.  You are inflicting harm on our children.  You have failed completely.  The Minister of State mentioned the progressing disability services and the language in the documents are a unicorn as they do not exist.  Maybe they do exist in her imagination but it does not exist on the ground.<br\/><br\/>In our lived experience children deteriorate for a lack of intervention to the point that it becomes life limiting and life threatening.  In Eoghan's case, his scoliosis was so bad that his lung function was reduced to about 25% and the curvature of his spine had compressed his chest cavity to the extent that his heart was not located where it should have been.  When a paediatric cardiologist scanned his heart and performed an echocardiogram she invited her team to take a look at the scan as it was such an extreme example.  Eoghan watched his own heart on the screen and he got such a fright that he got sick into the sink.  He has a great sense of humour because he said that it is all right for everyone else because it is not their heart on the screen.<br\/><br\/>When Eoghan had surgery he was an anaesthetic risk because there was a possibility that he would not survive.  For his transition year he underwent surgery but the procedure was far too late.  The surgery took nine hours and afterwards the anaesthetist manually ventilated and stayed in the theatre with him.  Even though she has her own family she stayed until she manually took him off the intubation because she felt that he might not survive in intensive care.  All of that was avoidable.<br\/><br\/>The problem does not lie with the clinicians, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists or occupational therapists.  The problem lies with the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department of Health and their failure to meaningfully engage with groups like the IHCA and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  The Government must restore pay equality.  I am glad that the Minister of State has met a few of our medical graduates who came home.  Why does she think that all of our physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists are leaving to go to Canada, Australia or the UK?  It is because this jurisdiction is a crap place to work.  I have a family member who works as a doctor in the system and her advice to any young person is to leave this jurisdiction.  During the week Dr. Ray Walley said that 75% of medical graduates plan to leave.  I have other family members who have qualified and none of them will stay here or work in the system that the Minister and Minister of State preside over.  The reason we have waiting lists and there is a lack of interventions is because the people do not exist on the ground and the same applies for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Many hundreds of hospital consultant posts remain unfilled and that, in turn, feeds into waiting lists and chaos, which must be addressed.<br\/><br\/>The problem lies with the Minister and Minister of State and they have failed.  On 11 June, I will be on the street outside the GPO with parents to talk about unmet needs and parents in absolute <i>extremis<\/i>.  How does the Minister of State think it makes me feel, as a parent, to see my child deteriorate?  Instead of saying we are failing, etc. will she please issue a statement from both the Department of Health and the HSE to the effect that they have failed?  If so, I can talk to the parents attending the protest and say that the Department of Health and the HSE admit that they have failed.<br\/><br\/>You have failed and we are in crisis.  It is a bit like seeing all of the people outside of Dublin Airport.  We, the parents and families, cannot be seen because we are a hidden community.  As a parent, I know that it hard to even get out one's front-door properly dressed due to all the stress.  I cannot even attend the meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters because my son's care package has failed and collapsed.  The irony of the fact is that I cannot do the business, as an elected representative who has been appointed to attend joint Oireachtas committee, because of a failure by the Minister of State.<br\/><br\/>When will pay equality be restored?  Please give me a timeline.  Will it be June or December of this year or in 2023?  I ask because medical staff will not return until that happens.<br\/><br\/>Finally, my next query is for the Department of Health.  I have some sympathy for Mr. Paul Reid as a fellow Finglas man and this is not a situation entirely of the HSE's making.  When will the Department of Health, and particularly the Secretary General, engage in meaningful negotiations with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and other associations?  Pay them and they will return because we have the most extraordinary graduates like the anaesthetist who manually ventilated my son.  This is the only country in the world that treats its medics and clinicians in such a negative fashion.  I know from my family members who work in the system, and from all of the correspondence that exists, in the HSE if a medic raises issues around patient safety or unsafe practices then he or she will be bullied.  They will be denied leave to do their continuing professional development or annual leave and that is a fact.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the previous Minister for Health yet no action was taken.  The HSE has a toxic workplace culture.  I know that Mr. Reid will be unhappy with that situation and it is a matter that he really needs to address.<br\/><br\/>The answer to all of the problems that we are talking about, and I mean this unicorn that has been called progressing disability services, is that people must be recruited.  One can only recruit and retain people if they are paid properly and treated with even the minimum of dignity and respect.  In terms of my son and all of the many hundreds of families who have contacted me, you have failed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#K01400","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":950,"content":"<p>Senator Clonan deserves a direct response from the HSE now.

It is a key part of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform in terms of getting what we discussed earlier, which is the provision of equity of services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the recruitment of consultants, over the last two years we have had the highest net increase in the number of consultants that we have had for many years and I fully acknowledge that we want more consultants.  We had a 470 net increase in the number of consultants, which allows for the number of people who have left the services.  That is a better trajectory than we have ever been on but we do want to recruit more.  As pay discussions continue it would be remiss of me to comment other than to say that we would like the discussions to reach closure, which I expect that is the same for all of the parties concerned.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of consultants raising safety issues, I must say that I was around for the last 48 hours and I know that people in the service are not shy about raising issues.

The board of the HSE has a safety policy committee that meets every month and reports on all incidents, not just creates reports.  We have a safety and quality process in place for people to strengthen the culture of openness and transparency.

We are focused on where bullying has been expressed within the service.

They are exhausted just trying to get the basic services their children need for the children to reach their basic developmental milestones.  I concur with Senator Clonan.  Those parents would agree that they have been failed as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to the start with Mr. Reid.  Nobody in this room has the monopoly on saying that the staff in the HSE care.  I agree with him.  I have met staff members in the CDNTs and I have family members who work directly with children with disabilities, and nobody goes into that line of work without caring.  For me, it is a vocation for them.  They go there because they want to make a big difference in the children's lives.  However, it is the systemic failures in the HSE that have led to these staff members being frustrated and to a mass exodus of staff from the HSE.<\/p><p>Deputy Sherlock asked a question that was not answered.  It was regarding the number of people have left the CDNTs since January.  Are exit interviews being conducted with these staff to find out why they are leaving and measures being put in place to stop this?  That is important.<\/p><p> The other matter I will touch on is probably the elephant in the room.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's honesty in respect of taking full responsibility for the failures regarding children with disabilities.  In any engagement I have had with her, I have found the Minister of State to be a straight talker.  I agree that the buck stops with her, but it is not just her.  I notice the gap between the HSE and the staff here.  It is very visible.  The optics are not good.<\/p><p> A concern I had recently was when the Minister of State was continuously blocked by the HSE from getting on-the-ground updates amid concerns she had about services for children with disabilities.  Has this matter been resolved to the Minister of State's satisfaction?  Is she getting the information she requires?

I am trying to remedy that by moving from the Department of Health to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in order that we see it through a wider lens - through a rights lens or a UNCRPD lens.

It is disappointing that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, did not see fit to attend.  While no one can doubt the Minister of State's commitment, given the scale of the issue involved and the failure to progress disability services, the least families would expect is the presence of the Cabinet Minister.<\/p><p>The evidence is overwhelming that progressing disability services is currently a failure.  It is failing children and families and breaching their rights.  It is not providing therapies when they are most needed and effective.  All present are aware of individual cases that represent the severe lack of services.  Down Syndrome Ireland, AsIAm, Inclusion Ireland and all the other representative groups have comprehensive reports showing the overall situation, from glaring regional variations to no therapies for more than a year, as well as a complete absence of communication.  This situation has gone way beyond the point of us sitting around and talking about what a disaster it is.  It is a breach of people's fundamental human rights and it is literally ruining people's lives.  Every week at the disability matters committee families, advocates, representative groups come in and explain how awful their life is as a result of this.  It has reached a point where, as a member of that committee, I am not comfortable with it any more.  We do not need more people to come in and tell us how awful it is and how challenging are their day-to-day lives.  We do not need that any more.  We know that.  What we need is action.  <\/p><p> The purpose of the disability matters committee is to oversee the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is glaringly obvious at this point that the reason Ireland has not ratified the optional protocol is simply the number of cases that would be taken against the State.  As many Deputies have highlighted, it is a breach of people's rights.  It is a breach of the convention.  If that optional protocol was ratified, a sea of cases would be taken against the State.  That is the reality.  For too long, the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act not having been implemented has been the excuse for not ratifying the optional protocol.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 has been rushed through this week because a case has been taken against the State.<\/p><p> My questions are mainly for the Department.

They migrate to other countries or go into private practice just to be able to do the jobs they are supposed to be doing.  Unless there is a considerable plan to rapidly help staff teams, this situation will get worse, not better.<\/p> <p>  A related issue is how student therapists are treated.

I have been listening to the meeting all morning.  I refer back to what Senator Clonan said about his lived experienced with his child.  To be blunt about it, it is something we have been hearing in the committee from families and from people representing families who have children with disabilities.  Bluntly, there is much talk going on but the people on the ground are not getting the service they require, deserve and are entitled to.  When the children&rsquo;s disability network teams were being set up, I believe all parents were getting the excuse that they were setting up the teams and once they were in place, they would have the world and all.  In the meantime, families were being left waiting.  There has been a failure to actually put these teams in place in an efficient manner to make sure that children get the services they deserve as a right.<\/p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to reiterate that we have failed our children who have disabilities.  I do not want to see or hear a hell of a lot more talk about reconfigurations, team building and this, that and the other, and having all the paperwork right and a hell of a lot of money spent on it, and yet not have the services in place.  <\/p> <p>  Only last week we had representatives from Down Syndrome Ireland in the committee.  They told us of a survey they carried out among their members in which 65% of the respondents said they did not have one therapy session in 2021.  That was 65% of the children with Down's syndrome.  This is something I ask the officials to take away with them.  The therapists are not there.  They told us international recruitment is not happening by the HSE.  Again, the section 38 and 39 organisations, which are a complete farce in this country, have left us with a triple tier of health payrolls and we have inequality within staff.  We have that inequality petering down to the children who cannot get services.  <\/p> <p>  The other thing I keep hearing &ndash; this is not from the Minister of State &ndash; is that basically, the Government will tell you that money is not the problem.  However, I do not think that parents want to know what the problem is not; rather, they want the problems solved.  There is a wake-up call for people who are involved in these services across the country to provide an equitable, accessible service whereby any parent who has a child with special needs will be given, first of all, a case worker who will bring the parent through the pathways where everything will be for that family.  At the moment, when parents find that their children have a special need, it becomes a war zone for them within their family, as a result of what is not being done by the HSE and the Department of Health.  That did not start today or yesterday; it has been going on for years.  It is a war zone.  The only thing that parents have in their minds is that they have to try to prove everything for their child.  For example, when parents have a child who is permanently blind from birth, every time they are looking for some sort of support, they have to go back and get consultants' letters to prove that their child is still blind.  That is unforgivable.  I get emotional about this because I feel that we as politicians and as governments - not just the Government of today, but continuously &ndash; and the HSE continuously, have let our people with disabilities down badly.<\/p> <p>  There are many things to be done.  The questions I had have already been asked.  In a nutshell, we need to realise that this is not about protecting systems, ourselves or this, that and the other, and we need to take a bit of courage into our hands.  I would say to Mr. Reid that it is time to put the boot in where it needs to be put in and make sure that the services are delivered and we have staff in place.  For example, we had a witness telling us last week that they had been given an appointment.  They were in the waiting room, waiting to be called into the appointment when they got a text to say that the appointment was cancelled.  They were then told another therapist would perhaps be able to see them.  Somebody else came out and said that the other therapist was out sick as well.  That is not the way to treat families, people with disabilities and our fellow citizens in this country.  There is a huge amount of goodwill and volunteering going on by people and parents.  They are fundraising and they do everything for the sake of their children.  The more they do, the more we stand back and let them at it, because it is easier.  However, it is wrong.  <\/p> <p>  I will finish on this.  Today, I ask the visiting officials, no more than did Senator Clonan, to admit it has been a failure and say that we will start from today to put it right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#Q00700","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>Like many others here, I have been inundated with concerned parents who are heartbroken, physically broken, who have been worn down by the constant fight by being on the receiving end of that adversarial and hostile response that Senator Clonan talked about and by being forced to fill the gaps in services themselves.  In attempting to paper over the cracks, we have tried to make parents the therapists, which just is not working.  These are parents who are emotionally, physically and mentally falling apart because of the strain that is being put on them.  There are, in turn, other knock-on consequences from that deep physical and emotional strain that we do not have time to get into today but which are incredibly important.  We need to start at that point of acknowledging those parents and the continued uphill struggle they are facing.<\/p> <p>  There is so much we could talk about but on the issue of staffing, at the end of the day, there are just not enough staff members to complete the assessments and do the work.  One of the issues here, of course, is retention.  I am quite worried.  Mr. Reid talked about how there were 35,000 new hires, but a net growth of roughly 14,000.  That is terrifying.<\/p><p>That is a huge number of people leaving the service.  To recruit approximately 35,000 people and to have a net increase of only about half of that is a sad indication of the loss of staff.  We could drill into that.  There is a net increase but are we losing clinicians and getting more administrators?  What do the figures look like?  If that is across the entire HSE, it covers hundreds of grades and roles.  What is the net figure for front-line clinicians?<\/p><p> We have discussed conditions a lot here.  These people want to be clinicians and they do care, as we have all acknowledged, but they are left managing bureaucracy, juggling case loads and meeting patients to tell them where their place is on the waiting list and how they will not be getting a service.  That is all they are doing.  We need to fix retention or we will be in a lot of trouble.  Much of fixing retention comes through the pipeline, as we have used the phrase here, of getting in new therapists.  I am coming at this from my social work background but we have been told that the HSE has specific problems recruiting speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.  A psychologist in training who is doing their clinical training is paid a salary.  In my time as a social work student, I remember doing my placement in a child and adolescent mental health service in which trainee psychologists who had about as much experience as me, or less, were getting paid while I, as a trainee social worker, was not.  The same goes for the speech and language and the occupational therapists.  If we want people to engage in the training we need to look at that.  Perhaps I should be looking at the Department on that.  Alongside that, there are many people who want to do the training and perhaps cannot afford it.  We are talking about trying to be creative and find new pipelines.  Part of that is recognising non-academic experience and trying to find new ways into the service but also supporting people to get into the education that is there.  We need to consider if one of our problems is that people are training and then leaving.  I have worked jobs where I have had my training paid for me on the condition that I sign a contract that I will not run away straight away and there are various clawbacks.  Why are we not doing that?  I appreciate that this may be something for a different Department - that is another siloing thing which we could drill into for hours - but can we explore something like that whereby we pay someone to become a speech and language therapist on the condition that they stay?  Then we can get an increase in numbers that would improve the conditions and hopefully get people to stay longer and you would be preventing all of that.<\/p><p> Another issue is filling the gap with private providers.  I seek reassurance that any private providers we are using are suitable, up to scratch and properly qualified and that there is proper oversight and that we are not letting rogue elements away with it.  I noted in Minister of State's opening statement that the private providers are included in the roadmap which spoke of \"piloting the use of groups such as local Down&rsquo;s syndrome organisations to ease pressure on CDNTs, even if only for a defined period\".  I must express concern about that because we have a habit of doing things for a defined period in an extreme circumstance and then they become permanent.  I am concerned that, as I have seen in other areas, we pull in community organisations to do the work the State should be doing and it becomes a permanent, unfunded or underfunded mandate of these community groups, with the people who are due to get the services being the ones to suffer.  I seek reassurance that it is a defined period and that it will be very short.  The same logic applies equally to the pausing of the individual family support plans.  Many people in my constituency have told me that they feel the individual family support plans are not worth the paper they are written on because there are not the staff behind them to deliver.  They would see no problem in throwing out individual family support plans if it meant getting the actual services.  Again, we are in the situation where we are scrambling to move beyond the failure but sowing the seeds for failure down the line by removing what can be a very useful service, if properly resourced.  <\/p><p> If legislation has not been commenced properly, that is not a failure of the Oireachtas.  The power to commence legislation is not in the House but in the Minister's wrist.  That is a function of the Executive.  If there are issues with legislation needing to be reformed or commenced, that needs to be taken up with the line Minister directly.  I am concerned that any attempt to reform legislation must be done in a way that does not undermine the existing statutory rights.

I think that is an example of privatisation gone wrong.<\/p> <p>  If these have been answered earlier, I apologise.  I had other meetings to go to.  In December 2021, Mr. Reid stated that the HSE did not want to publish the Brandon report in full because it did not want to \"compromise\" the scoping review into whether disciplinary action was required.  It is now June 2022.  What is the outcome of that scoping review?  Is it still ongoing?

Thirty-five thousand is the total number of people we will have had to bring into the system.  I say that figure because it has never been achieved in the history of the HSE.  We have had to put in place a whole new set of recruitment processes in place nationally, locally and internationally.  There are recruitment processes, particularly for nursing, in India, the Philippines and the Middle East.  We have targeted about 1,800 nursing midwife professionals to come in from international campaigns.  That is along with the 1,500 nursing midwife graduates this year to whom we want to give placements.  We have never achieved any figures like that.  We can forward a breakdown of figures for this year to date to reassure the Deputy.  We are at a total staffing level of just over 137,000 whole-time equivalents.  That is about 150,000 staff.<\/p><p>The vast majority of this year's recruitment has been primarily focused on front-line services.  In primary care services, for example, 80% of recruitment has been to front-line professions.  We recruit management and administrative staff because we need people to manage and oversee services and to provide services of a safe quality.  We are recruiting in a different way.  It is a strategic recruitment plan that we have never had before, with us recruiting on a three- to five-year basis.  We want to ensure that we are targeting the gaps.<\/p><p> Regarding the churn, approximately 4,000 of the 35,000 people were recruited for testing, tracing and vaccination.  They were people who wanted to return to the workforce, and thankfully did, and now want to return to retirement or whatever other roles they play in society.  The 9,500 churn within the health service involves people retiring - a significant number will retire over the next three years - as well as others leaving the service.  We have a large, young and mobile workforce and people will emigrate again, particularly now that this opportunity has been restored.  This churn is not completely out of kilter with what I have seen in the private sector or across the public service, but it is a large churn just to stand still.  I was making that point to provide some context.<\/p><p> The recruitment breakdown is approximately 4,800 nurses and midwives, 470 consultants, 2,000 healthcare assistants and a further 4,000 client and patient care staff.  These are people working in front-line services.  This is significant recruitment.  To restate what my colleague, Ms Crehan-Roche, mentioned, we are seeing some people returning through the international recruitment campaigns.  We have done the early stage of a study of people, in particular doctors, who did not go away for reasons of pay, but for good quality conditions and healthcare that they did not view us as having.  A significant proportion of those people return within three years.  There are benefits that we can take from people going away, getting experience and returning.  That will happen in the health service.<\/p><p> The retention of people in whose training and education a significant investment has been made is a major policy issue.  We are seeing some of the impacts of people leaving.  Some countries employ a period of a sustainable number of years where someone must stay in the service.  I do not see that working, but this is a significant issue.  In recent years, though, our graduates have generally been staying.  Of course, people can now travel more.<\/p><p> We have discussed pay disparity issues.<\/p><p> Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd asked about the NIRP process and the Brandon report.  As I stated publicly at the time, there were a couple of reasons for producing that report.  First, the NIRP report process is one that facilitates people coming forward to contribute on a confidential basis.  They are given that commitment so that we may extract from them information on where harm occurred.  That was the approach recommended by the NIRP and its chairperson, and remains so to this day in terms of our publication of the executive summary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>Is the scoping exercise finished?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#S00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

Mr. Reid will agree that the frustration expressed by members comes on the back of the frustration, exhaustion and pain experienced by many parents of children with disabilities.  On Tuesday, Deputy Tully organised a briefing in the AV room for parents of children of disabilities in Cavan and Monaghan.  There were four parents at the meeting, all of whom held up photographs of their children, who varied in age from five to 12 or 13.  What was consistent across their cases was that most, if not all, had been failed by the system.  Some of them had received no services whatsoever while the services for those who did get some were patchy and few and far between.  That was just one meeting of ten that I attended in recent weeks.  I listened to hundreds of parents express their frustration, exhaustion and pain.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult for parents of young children with disabilities to look at young adults who have been failed because early intervention did not happen and many of them got no services, leading to developmental problems.  I am a parent of two young boys.  Any parent would do what they could for his or her child.  If you have a child with a disability, you just want to have the services as quickly as possible and to get the best for your child.  We have to give expression to the exhaustion, frustration and pain that the parents feel.  It is not a reflection on any individual staff member or even anyone in this room.  When we last discussed this issue months ago, I stated my belief that everyone in the room should have been ashamed of the failures in this area.  This is not to say that there were not successes or that there were not children who got good services, but for those children who we failed and are continuing to fail, we should all feel shame.  This is particularly the case when you have to look into the eyes of those children and their parents.  The Minister of State has engaged with many of the parents.<\/p><p>They have got to the point where they do not want to attend meetings any more because they are hearing the same stories.  They want solutions and to know when things will change.  I accept that there are no easy solutions either, but I will put some questions in that regard.  That is how people feel.<\/p><p> Turning to Mr. O'Regan, part of the problem is that we submit parliamentary questions to get information and basic data and he responds to those on behalf of the HSE.  We do not get answers.  Here are some examples.  I asked about the number of open cases involving CDNTs where individual family service plans are in place.  The information could not provided.  I asked about the number of persons who have received assessments of need but not service statements.  The information could not be provided.  I asked about the number of children who have had assessments of need and where a need has been identified but services have not been provided.  The information could not be given.  I asked about the number of children referred for services; these are not numbers having assessments because we know they do not all need assessments but, rather, those who have been referred for services and got none.  The information could not be provided.<\/p><p> We know there are issues with the database that underpins the recording of this, and we went through this before.  Again, I do not know if the issue has been resolved, although the witnesses have spoken about a new integrated system that needs to be put in place.  The section 13 annual reports were to be published going back a long number of years.  I still do not know if those reports have been completed or published.  If the executive does not have basic data and I cannot understand the need, how can anybody understand it?  That is the real frustration for me.<\/p><p> I have engaged with the Minister on this matter.  Children have a right to assessments, which should be as comprehensive as possible.  I also accept that the critical area is services and that children need access to services.  That is where we must put all or most of our energy.  Staffing is the key issue.  The census was published in April but it is out of date because the Minister of State has indicated that the figure for vacancies is not 524.5 it is 714.  We cannot recruit the staff and there are reasons for that, which must be addressed.  If we do not do it, we are at nothing.  We will face those parents time and again, month after month and year after year without any resolution.<\/p><p> I have a number of direct questions for Mr. Reid.  What is the engagement between the HSE and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science with respect to training places?  We must clearly recruit and train more professionals, and that process must be ratcheted up quite dramatically over the next number of years.<\/p><p> We have an access to care fund for acute services.  I say this as somebody who, from an ideological perspective, would prefer the use of taxpayers' money for the funding of the health services went to public services.  Looking at these children and parents in the eye, however, if there is the possibility of purchasing services from the private sector for them, we should do that in the short term.  It is not a long-term solution but it could be used in the short term.  We should look at a similar fund for community services, particularly in the context of children with disabilities, with a similar fund in place for mental health services.  Is that something the HSE would consider and put in place?<\/p><p> I do not have the monopoly on answers, and nobody has all the wisdom and solutions.  We all want to get there.  I will do absolutely everything I can and work with the Minister and the people across from me to resolve this matter.  The failures people raised earlier are real, however, and must be acknowledged.  They are part of a lived reality.  I ask, in that spirit, that everything humanly possible be done to resolve the matter and that we put a plan in place that people can see will work over time.  Nobody is expecting a magic-wand solution - it is not there - but we should be able to fix the problem over time.  We must fix the data problems as well because if we cannot have basic data, we cannot plan or fully understand the extent of the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#S02600","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>I absolutely agree on the data issue, including in terms of our accountability.

From the way the meeting has gone, however, it is clear the recruitment drive needs to be made to ensure, as regards the teams that are being proposed,that  we have the recruitment of full teams and the retention of staff.<\/p><p> I look at anecdotal evidence that we have received over recent days where, in the past two or three weeks, people who have been on temporary contracts with the HSE or with one of the service providers have not had their contracts renewed.  They have had to proceed somewhere else to get a permanent contract because they were looking to purchase houses or to do the normal day-to-day living things.  That has left vacancies within the service for people with disabilities, whether that is in respite, in the HSE or in section 38 or 39 organisations.  As everybody here has accepted, there is a shortage of staff within all of the services.  We have see in the past week or two that people have had to leave the services because the State has not done its business in ensuring those staff members were retained.<\/p><p> We have heard it from different areas that there has been a brain drain.  We have people here who have given their time to caring, who understand people with disabilities, who care passionately about them and about improving their lives, and we need to ensure we are keeping those people within the services.  The section 38 and 39 organisations and the parity of esteem in pay is a matter that needs to be dealt with because every logjam must be removed to ensure we keep all the good people in the services.<\/p><p> I made the point in the D&aacute;il yesterday in another debate that the recruitment drive has to involve an overseas element as well.  On the points that were made in respect of the higher education Ministers, we need to have everybody working on board here.  The State, the HSE, the Department of Health and our committee here need to accept that, while this morning's meeting was a very thorough meeting, from here on we have to try to ensure we are doing something meaningful to change this.  We would hope, if their schedules allow it, to have both the Department and the HSE back here in the autumn to review this.  We need to ensure the issues that have been raised by the members today are being addressed and that the families, the children, the lives and the lived experience of people with disabilities who have been failed by the State improves from here on in.  That is what our committee and everybody here is charged with, and we hope to do that.<\/p><p> I thank sincerely the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for her dedication to the job, the HSE and the officials present, our own team here, all the members of the two joint committees, and Deputy Funchion for allowing me to chair the meeting with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022060200002#T00900","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654124400,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 12.53 p.m. until 9.45 a.m. on Thursday, 23 June 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality","time":1654124400,"counter":1085},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:00<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:00<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, Lisa Chambers, Sorca Clarke, Regina Doherty, Neasa Hourigan.

In particular this morning we are looking at the recommendations on care and social protection.  Today we will focus on the issue of care and early years education for children.  I welcome our witnesses who are representing three organisations.  From Early Childhood Ireland I welcome Frances Byrne, director of policy, advocacy and campaigning.  From SIPTU's Big Start campaign I welcome Mr. Darragh O'Connor, the head of strategic organising and campaigns.  From Treoir I welcome Mr. Damien Peelo, CEO, and Ms Mary Roach, information and policy officer.  Ms Roach is joining us via Teams.  They are all very welcome.  It is particularly nice to see them all in person.  Many of us have engaged with them over Teams and Zoom in recent years.  We really appreciate them joining us.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

Participants who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within Leinster House do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.<\/p> <p>  Before I ask the witnesses to make their opening statements I want to say that the committee has taken the view that our work is about seeing the implementation of the 45 recommendations on gender equality, including the recommendations on care and social protection.  We see these wonderful recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly as a blueprint for gender equality in Ireland and our role as providing a means to ensure their implementation and that they are put into effect.  We are very conscious of the need to be practical and to look at an action plan for how to implement the recommendations.  We are very grateful to all of the witnesses for engaging with us already with their submissions and for all of their work on the care recommendations in particular.  We really appreciate their coming to assist us with our work.<\/p> <p>  We have already dealt with quite a number of the recommendations in a modular fashion and we will finish our work in December with a report that we see as forming an action plan.  We are glad that members of the Citizens' Assembly have been engaging with us and following our proceedings online throughout.  I welcome anyone who is following us online.<\/p> <p>  I invite Ms Byrne to make her opening statement on behalf of Early Childhood Ireland.

As members have seen in our submission documents, our focus is on recommendations Nos. 8 and 9.  These are focused on childcare and parental leave.  With regard to childcare, the recommendations the Citizens' Assembly put before the Oireachtas were that over the next decade we would move to a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of quality, affordable early years and out-of-hours childcare and increase the State share of GDP spent on childcare from the current 0.37% of GDP to at least 1% by no later than 2030.  Having made a submission to the assembly, and appearing before it virtually during Covid, Early Childhood Ireland was very pleased to see these recommendations.  We were also delighted to hear that the committee is endorsing them and this is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  As committee members know, Ireland remains a laggard in terms of investment in early years and school-age childcare.  As with other issues, the Irish public and members of the Citizens' Assembly are ahead of policy makers in their recognition of the value of early years education and care.  We have included in our submission document several graphs from the barometer we have produced annually for the past five years.  It is based on independent nationwide opinion polling.  A total of 80% of the Irish public believes that every child should have the right to high-quality accessible early years care and education.<\/p> <p>  The Government has committed to major transformation.  This is very welcome.  In this vein, last December it accepted the recommendations of an expert funding group.  If these recommendations were fully implemented transformation would certainly be achieved.  If the Government stays on track it may surpass its own commitments and the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly well before the end of this decade.<\/p> <p>  According to the Citizens' Assembly report paid leave should cover the first year of a child&rsquo;s life.  It should also be non-transferable to encourage the sharing of childcare responsibility between parents in a two-parent family.  For one-parent families, the Citizens' Assembly has recommended that they should be provided with the same total leave period as a couple.  Paid leave should be incentivised by increasing payment levels to encourage increased take up.  Early Childhood Ireland wholeheartedly supports these recommendations.  They are in the best interests of children and their families.  The Irish public also agrees, as borne out by our opinion polling.  A total of 63% of the Irish public agrees that parents should be supported with leave to cover the first year of a child's life.  While it is vital that these recommendations are prioritised it is also important to ensure that additional supports that families need in the first year of a baby's life are also provided, up to and including centre-based or home-based early years care.  I can say more about this if members wish during the questions and answers.<\/p> <p>  If we could urge the committee to consider one recommendation in its focus on implementation, it would be that it assign to a specific Oireachtas committee the ongoing monitoring of the Citizens' Assembly's recommendation on public expenditure on early years and school-age care.  The First 5 strategy recognises the inappropriateness of using gross domestic product as a measurement in Ireland as it includes the profits of multinational firms.  They do not make or sell anything in Ireland despite being based in this country.  As of now, it is the only measurement we have.  If our proposal is accepted then as part of its deliberations a specific Oireachtas committee could also examine this issue.  It would offer important political leadership on this crucial issue.<\/p> <p>  With renewed thanks to the committee for the invitation to appear before it today we hope that its important deliberations will return time again to the right of children to high-quality provision of what is, and should be valued as, an essential public good.  The indicator that should matter most to us all is that every child in Ireland has equal access to quality and inclusive early years and school-age care services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting SIPTU to discuss the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  SIPTU is the union for early years professionals.  We represent approximately 6,000 educators, lead educators and managers working in community and private services throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations on early childhood education and care, specifically increasing State spending to 1% in order to move to a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of quality with professional pay and conditions for workers.  Ireland&rsquo;s early childhood education and care system is marked by high fees for parents and low pay for workers.  This is due to low levels of State funding and the market-based approach of delivery.  The key challenge for the State is to reform the funding model so that increased government funding can achieve the policy objectives of quality, which means better pay, affordability and accessibility.  The introduction of core funding from September 2022 is a significant development.  It will address key structural issues and lay the foundation for further investment and reform.<\/p> <p>  High quality early childhood education and care has a positive impact on children's educational, cognitive, behavioural, and social outcomes.<\/p><p>However, high staff turnover undermines these benefits and is associated with lower quality services and poorer child outcomes.  High staff turnover is driven by low pay in Ireland.  A qualified early years educator with a QQI level 5 award earns just &euro;11.57 per hour on average.  A graduate lead educator, with QQI level 8 award, earns just &euro;13.21 per hour on average.  Research shows that 45% of early years professionals are actively seeking work in another employment, with low pay identified as being the main driving factor.  It has also resulted in a staffing crisis for service providers.  Some 91% indicated they were concerned that problems with recruiting and retaining staff would negatively impact the viability of their service.  Simply put, low pay is undermining quality for children, the sustainability of services and leaving thousands, mostly women workers, in poverty.<\/p><p> At the same time, parents in Ireland are paying some of the highest fees in the European Union.  Not only does this block women&rsquo;s participation in all sectors of society, but it also undermines children&rsquo;s rights to access early years education.  A report by Frontier Economics found that free early years has a positive, and sometimes substantial, impact on women&rsquo;s labour force participation, employment and increased hours.  This is consistent with findings by other bodies, including the European Commission and OECD.  According to the European Commission, average monthly fees are the highest in countries which rely on market mechanisms to supply early years.  Currently, Ireland relies on a market mechanism to supply early years.  Each provider must raise enough revenue, primarily from parents, to at least cover the expenditure and profit and surplus.  This pits the goals of affordability and quality against each other.  If a provider wants to attract qualified staff, and pay professional wages, they need to raise fees and this undermines affordability.  If a provider wants to reduce fees to enhance affordability, they will need to reduce expenditure.  As wages make up 70% of expenditure, this means having to constrain or reduce wages and working conditions, which undermines professionalisation.  The current model of funding puts providers in an impossible situation as they cannot provide both affordability and professional salaries.  This impacts negatively on the quality of care for children.  <\/p><p> In September 2022, a new supply-side core funding scheme will be introduced with &euro;172 million of new State investment.  This will allow the State to effectively target spending on quality and affordability.  For example, a pay agreement is currently being negotiated at the early years joint labour committee which will set legally binding rates of pay.  This process will ensue that increased funding for pay will end up in workers' pockets, addressing the issue of high staff turnover.  Access to core funding is also dependent on providers agreeing a fee freeze.<\/p><p> SIPTU welcomes the Government&rsquo;s acceptance that it must play a role in the promotion of professional levels of pay in early years.  Indeed, SIPTU advocates that Government take an additional step by assuming full responsibility for employee compensation.  This would allow for an approximate 70% reduction in parental fees while ensuring the professionalisation of the sector.<\/p><p> In conclusion, a public service model of early should place the rights of children and the needs of families at its heart.  We must also recognise the essential contribution of all early years professionals and providers to the provision of high-quality services that are accessible and affordable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Treoir welcomes the opportunity to address the joint committee on gender equality.  Treoir works with our members to improve the lives of parents who are not married to each other, and the lives of their children.  We acknowledge the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, and we welcome all the recommendations in its report.<\/p> <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted existing issues to do with the provision of key public services, of which access to decent and affordable childcare and early childhood development and education is one.  For example, a survey by the National Women&rsquo;s Council on women&rsquo;s experiences of care found that lone parents felt particularly under pressure to look after children, provide home-schooling, and work to financially support their families, all without the usual support networks.  When asked about employment and income, 42% of parents said their major concern was childcare, followed by loss of income.<\/p> <p>  The Government response to the pandemic showed that if the State wishes to, it can provide a service on a mass scale.  It has the means and the ability to do so.  Over the past 12 months, the Government has made significant investment in early childhood and education care and the national childcare scheme.  While we acknowledge this, it does not address the foundational problems within the system.  For example, the ECEC is limited and based on access to care as an entitlement but with very limited hours.  The national childcare scheme is designed as a labour activation measure and allocates childcare hours based on a mother&rsquo;s links to the labour market.  It is not based on need.  The State&rsquo;s reliance on private operators to deliver the service, while at the same time starving the community childcare sector of much-needed resources, is hugely problematic.  Today, childcare in Ireland is market-driven, privatised and for profit.  Provision is patchy and can vary greatly in terms of access and quality, depending on where you live.<\/p> <p>  Treoir campaigns for and supports a publicly-funded and universally accessible model of early childhood and childcare and puts the well-being of children at its core.  We believe early childhood education and development should be deemed a key public service and it should be a right for all children.  At societal and political levels, it should be seen as an opportunity to intervene in child poverty and to support lone parents.  Such a model has the potential to address the structural inequalities reproduced from the care responsibilities imposed on women.  In this context, Treoir supports the recommendations that Ireland move to a publicly-funded model of early years and out-of-hours childcare, that the State increases the share of GDP spent on childcare and introduces paid leave for parents for the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, and that lone parents receive the same total leave as a couple.<\/p> <p>  Regarding social welfare, research has repeatedly shown that lone parents - 86% of whom are women - are more likely to experience one form or another of deprivation, to live in sub-standard rented accommodation, to be over represented in homeless accommodation and to be dependent on State transfers.  Their life chances are severely impacted by the interconnectedness of care and the economy with the result that when employed, they will be in low paid precarious work characterised by poor working conditions and limited rights.  Yet research from the ESRI suggests only full-time employment is effective in lifting families out of poverty.  These findings are hugely problematic for lone parents who bear primary responsibility for care, and often cannot reconcile full-time work with the provision of that care.<\/p> <p>  The interplay of care, the economy, and the welfare system really comes to the fore when we look at the issue of social welfare entitlement and the rules which govern it.  Treoir supports the citizens' assembly&rsquo;s recommendation on social welfare and particularly that a fully individualised social protection system is introduced to promote the equal division of paid work and care.  We agree payments should be set at a level that addresses poverty and supports an adequate standard of living, and that gender proofing is carried out in the piloting of a universal basic income scheme.<\/p> <p>  Changes to the one parent family payment since 2013 have had a negative impact on the well-being and life chances of lone parents, resulting in 30% of lone parents being at risk of poverty, compared with 12% of two-parent households.  Treoir believes the social welfare system must recognise lone parents&rsquo; care responsibilities and must ensure that part-time work, combined with social welfare payments, provide economic security to one parent families.<\/p> <p>  We note the citizens' assembly&rsquo;s call for the specific needs of lone parents to be addressed with regard to access to education.  In this respect, Treoir is calling for the Student Universal Support Ireland grant scheme to be available for part-time, online, and blended learning and access courses.<\/p> <p>  In closing, Treoir welcomes the emphasis on the State as a key player with the ability to shape and change existing relationships via policy and legislation.  We reiterate the importance of a welfare system decoupled from the labour market for the creation of more just and caring society.  We note the citizens' assembly&rsquo;s recognition that gender inequalities are intensified by discrimination on other grounds, and that men also suffer from inequality, lack of opportunity and discrimination.  Article 18 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the child states that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing of children, and that the State should use its best efforts to ensure the recognition of this principle.  <\/p> <p>  I thank members for their attention and we are happy to take any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Peelo.

If gender and class are taken together, it is within that context that we can talk about the position of lone parents.  They are marginalised and they experience discrimination and economic disadvantage on the basis of their gender.  Women take the bulk of the caring responsibilities in Ireland and across the globe and they also parent on their own.  Moreover, we know from the work done by the Low Pay Commission that they are overwhelmingly positioned within the lower ranks of the labour market.  They may be in precarious, low-paid employment and have poor working conditions.  Even if they are working, they tend to be the working poor because they do not have access to a public childcare system, they are caught with unpaid caring responsibilities for the child and their ability to engage in the labour market means they are open to exploitation and to very low-paid positions.  They can be stuck in poverty, as all the reports going back ten or 15 years have shown.<\/p> <p>  Coupled with that, there have been changes to the welfare system.  Since 2013, we have seen the dismantling of supports that traditionally existed for lone parents.  Their entitlement to the one-parent family allowance, for example, stops once their youngest child reaches the age of seven.  I suppose this explains Mr. Peelo's statement about the need to decouple the welfare system, if we want to address poverty and deprivation in lone-parent households, from labour market participation.  That goes back to the idea of a basic minimum income standard of living for every household.  We have to have a support network of income beyond which we are not prepared to let people fall.  No matter what these women do, they cannot improve their lot, so the onus has to be on the State to redesign a system whereby we can lift lone-parent families out of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Roche"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>On the universal basic income scheme, research, including a great deal of work done by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, has shown the minimum income standards that are necessary.  As we saw earlier during the pandemic, when the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, came in, it was set at a level that was recognised as necessary to be able to live, yet when people daily need a level of income to be able to survive, what they are given is much lower than what the PUP was.  That payment was seen as being connected to work rather than to the basic need to live.  Treoir fully supports the idea of a minimum standard of income and of living, and that is connected to a range of service provision as well, whereby publicly-funded services need to be made available.<\/p> <p>  On the question about men suffering from inequality, a lack of opportunity and discrimination, this relates primarily to the traditional sense of fathers being recognised as breadwinners rather than carers.  Treoir works, in particular, in this sphere with parents who are not married.  This committee has examined Article 41 and the possibility of constitutional change to recognise the rights of families and parents who are not married.  There is a clear recognition that people who are not married do not have the same protections and rights as married parents.  In terms of care, unmarried fathers do not have automatic rights to the guardianship of, access to and custody of their children.  Even if they were cohabiting for many years and the relationship has broken down, they will not have rights to the access to and custody of their children, although they may be entitled to guardianship under the new regulations brought in with the Children and Family Relationships Act.  There are issues with the equality of care and that carer responsibility should be shared out more equally between parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>That was why I wanted to ask about this issue.

Often, however, he or she will be seen as the non-custodial parent and, therefore, his or her right to high-quality accommodation that is appropriate for the needs of his or her children and to have carer responsibilities for the children may not be granted.

We absolutely agree with that, but additional supports may be needed for a variety of reasons that, as I said, may be pre-existing or may arise during the first year.  We suggest there be a recognition of that, part of which could relate to expert, high-quality early years care and education, even in the first year, as a family support intervention.

To be clear, Early Childhood Ireland agrees that in the vast majority of circumstances, the country and society should be supporting babies being at home with mum and-or dad, depending on the family's circumstances.

I would like to expand on some of the things Mr. Peelo and other contributors touched on around the social welfare supports that are in place.  Maybe we can pull this out a little further.  The criteria that exist fail to grasp the reality lived by a number of lone parents, who may go on to become cohabiting parents or a married couple, in the sense that if there is a social welfare payment, it is dependent on both of them.  There is an assumption that the non-biological parent or adult in that home will take on the financial responsibilities of the child yet Revenue still treats these individuals as being entirely separate, even if they are cohabiting and have been for a considerable period of time.  As the child ages, if that couple has not married and continues to cohabit, SUSI will entirely disregard the earned income of the non-biological parent.  This seems like a chronic lack of joined-up thinking and a complete lack of any common sense as to what a family unit now looks like.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Ms Byrne and the affordability of childcare, as a mother of four I have walked this walk and I know the financial costs that can come with it.  There are also very real questions around the availability of childcare, particularly in our regions and in rural Ireland, where there may be no options for either full-time or part-time childcare providers.  When there is talk of increasing GDP, does Ms Byrne see any merit in targeting areas that have no or very low provision of childcare, in tandem with providing additional support to the services that exist?  We heard quite recently in the media that there are significant delays in children with additional needs being assessed and receiving a diagnosis.  What impact does that have on early education providers?  If they know a child who is coming to their service has additional needs and is on a waiting list, what impact does that have on their ability to provide a service that meets the needs of such children?<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. O'Connor.  The level of pay in the childcare sector is truly beyond fathom.  We value these individuals enough to leave our offspring with them and provide an early childhood education but the pay they receive is not comparable with the level of responsibility and trust parents place in them.  From an international perspective, has a comparison been done on the pay, conditions and progression opportunities childcare workers have here compared to other countries?  It is my firmly held belief that there has been a systemic failure to recognise the need, value and importance of early years education, as opposed to childminding.  I can hire a babysitter on a Friday evening no problem.  I can hire a local teenager.  That is very different from what early years education looks like. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#G00500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>There is plenty there.

People are living in poverty and struggling with the basics.  They are leaving the sector.  We have asked all these people to train up and skill up, and they are delivering a professional service, and they have no choice but to leave their profession.  That is what is happening.  It is not universal.  There is a big spectrum.  There are people who are earning the minimum wage and then there are people who are paid a decent rate.  If you want good quality early years, you are going to have pay the staff.  That is it.  The next question is who pays.  Is it the State or parents?  We could double the fees for parents and give everybody proper pay and pensions and all the rest, but politically that is not feasible.  Parents do not have the money to do that.  Once you accept the State has a role in supporting good quality and affordability, the question is how to get the money in there and make sure State investment delivers on policy goals.  Core funding addresses that in a real way but previously, when money was going into the system it might reduce fees or increase pay but there was no guarantee.  It is about the State taking command and using those levers to achieve the policy objectives.  Hopefully there will be a pay deal in place from September this year, which is a start.  It is certainly not the finish but it would lift a lot of people up from where they are at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the international comparisons, when early years is delivered by the free market we see very similar situations, with high fees for parents and low pay.  In quite a lot of Europe, where there is a mix of public and private provision, it is treated much more like teaching, with comparable rates of pay.  If we are asking people to do a level 8 course and come out of DCU or Limerick with all their qualifications but one person is teaching eight-year-olds and another is caring for and educating four-year-olds, there will be a massive gap in their lived experience when it comes to pay and conditions.  There should not be.  They have an equal impact on the lives of children, which can be transformative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>The figures on pay rates are stark.

There are horrendous waiting lists and women will say, with their tongues in their cheeks, that they rang their partners, they rang their mothers and then they rang the cr&egrave;che when they found out they were expecting because it can be so difficult to find a place.  Within a rural context there might be a place available but it could be 45 km down the road.  The Deputy knows about the challenges with rural transport better than I do.  We come back to a lack of planning and during the Celtic tiger years this was not the case for a couple of years, including in the area of Dublin I live in.  However, by and large if four year-olds did not land out of the sky and the Department of Education knew there were lots of houses being built in an area then it had the demographics, it planned accordingly and, by and large, it built schools.  That does not happen with early years education and there is not the same kind of planning.<\/p><p> Before the most recent election Early Childhood Ireland had three asks, one of which was for a single agency.  We were pleased to see that in the programme for Government and to get the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties for it in the run-up to the formation of that Government.  It is critical so that we can have proper planning and oversight for us as a society.  More and more money is coming in and we have an unprecedented &euro;221 million promised this year in a full year, which is welcome.  We want that to continue.  There needs to be transparency around that and we need to have better planning in the availability of places.  We also need to know that we will have universal quality.  In the Scandinavian model, as the Deputy has recognised, people understandably focus on affordability.  The Scandinavian model also guarantees a level of quality and curriculum delivery to every child, regardless of his or her location, be it rural or urban, and regardless of their parental income.  In Ireland, we have almost 30,000 educators who are delivering quality every day but we do not have the same universality.  We cannot guarantee that because we are not investing enough and because of the issues the Deputy is well aware of, including staff turnover.  Staffing, quality of staff and a continuity of relationship between highly qualified staff and young children is a critical factor in delivering quality.  We know that if we have high staff turnover and churning within the sector, where people are staying in the sector but moving settings, that is bad for the babies and children in those settings.<\/p><p> I will turn to the access issue the Deputy raised.  This is one of the positive stories about our sector and there is a wonderful programme called the access and inclusion model  We love our acronyms in the early years sector so it is called AIM.  It is only delivered through the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, and we would love to see it extended.  It is one of the commitments that has been given in Partnership for the Public Good, the funding model report I referred to in the presentation earlier.  We warmly welcome that but that needs to be extended.  Although we are not a direct parent support service, we heard from parents as recently as last week who were concerned that their three year-old who is doing so well in the 38 weeks in preschool is going to miss the transition to school, and this includes older children as well.<\/p><p> There is a discussion to be had about the model and about extending it, and leaks are starting to come out about looking at that in the context of budget 2023.  I am putting this in a light way, although I do not mean to be light-hearted about it.  However, it is such a good news story about the sector.  There are administrative difficulties within it, and there are assessments and we hear from members every year that they have difficulties waiting for money to come through.  You do not get to hear this often but providers can end up out of pocket too but they sort of take it on the chin and build it into their finances.  They should not have to do that because they do not want to have to turn way children with additional needs.  That programme is valued and on the hard days, because of the lack of investment and so on, the sector can be proud that it has delivered it in recent years and that it has helped children and families.  It has been an inclusive mark of the sector.  It is a positive programme but it needs a lot more support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1115,"content":"<p>It is good to hear a good news story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#H00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1116,"content":"<p>Deputy Clarke nailed it and she has highlighted the problems within the social protection system with the lack of interdepartmental co-operation and the lack of connectedness between them.  The recent and high profile case of John O'Meara highlights this in a real way.  For those who do not know, John O'Meara was a father who cohabited with his partner.  They had three children together and were together for 20 years or so before his wife sadly died a year ago.  John, in his na&iuml;vet&eacute;, applied to the Department for the widower's grant and pension and was refused them based on the fact that he was not married to his partner.  They were treated as two separate individuals, even though they both paid their PRSI and had both been working.  For every other social welfare entitlement they would have been assessed individually but for this one they were treated separately.  I know there is a Bill before the Seanad on this and that is one example.<\/p> <p>  There are other cases where we have a belief that the system is more invested in rooting out fraud and in suspicion of claimants and their need for making social welfare claims, particularly lone parents.  This system is not conducive to supporting shared parenting and the Deputy has again highlighted the issue that if a mother has begun a new relationship and if that person comes to stay over there are all sorts of suspicions about whether they should be allowed to be in the house, what role they have and whether that affects the parent's entitlement.  During lockdown we even had examples of parents who were subjected to social welfare inspections when the whole country was locked down to see if people were coming to stay with them and spending time in their homes.  There is a lack of understanding of what shared parenting is and there is a need for training for front-line staff to be developed.  That lack of understanding is ingrained in the culture and policies of the Department.  There should be a requirement that anyone implementing the public sector human rights and equality duty would undergo training and understanding of what their role is, of what the shared parenting issues are and of what the challenges for many one-parent families are.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has said it.  Some of the issues that emerge in social protection and in supporting lone parents into shared parenting and developing new relationships are well documented.  The means testing of medical cards, the working hours and the poverty traps that are there for people still exist, despite mountains of evidence going in to support the fact that the thresholds need to be lifted to support parents to remain out of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1117,"content":"<p>Ms Byrne touched on AIM and said that providers have taken those additional costs on the chin.

Nevertheless, even with the improvements in reporting on funding the average full-day cr&egrave;che is still reporting into and subject to inspection or auditing by up to seven State agencies, or both.<\/p><p>There are also environmental health inspections for those who cook food on the premises.  Nobody is saying that there should not be regulations - far from it - but there is a significant administrative burden on providers.  There has been flexibility within the system.  During Covid, the Department very much took the fact that children may not be able to attend on board for very understandable reasons relating to lockdown, whether parents were back at work and the existence of Covid in a family and offered additional flexibility but this needs to be extended.  We would hope that some of that would be dealt with when childcare Ireland is set up.  This is the agency that is envisaged by the Government.  We would hope that there would be one set of eyes on settings as opposed to seven pairs.  <\/p><p> Apart from the money, which is very welcome given that up until now, we were the lowest investors across the OECD, one of the very welcome things about core funding is that it will decouple funding from attendance.  This is really important.  If I have an ECCE-only arrangement - picture your own area wherever you live and I live in a housing estate where there are two or three Montessori premises attached to houses - they would typically have space for 11 children or 22 if they have a second session.  It concerns what happens if that cr&egrave;che signs the core funding contract and has the capacity, including space, staffing, etc., for 11 or 22 children and come September, only eight of those children take up places.  I know we hear about waiting lists but circumstances can change and parents can also understandably put names down in a number of cr&egrave;ches in the local area so the expected numbers of children do not always walk in the door in September.<\/p><p> What the Department has done, which is really welcome and goes back to the expert group's report, is say that if a cr&egrave;che's capacity is for that number of children, it will base its core funding contract on that even if the number drops to eight during the year for whatever reason such as families moving.  That is really welcome.  This is what happens in Scandinavia.  We talk about Scandinavia.  They murder us up there.  The Nordic countries are all different.  There are lovely iPads and little Johan's mum, dad or guardian comes in, settles Johan and on the way out, moves like we all do when we want to get access to an app, and I should not be mentioning a brand, on our tablet or phone and at some point during the morning, an educator will go around and make sure that Johan is there and that is that.  The state does not care about whether the cr&egrave;che had 14 or 16 children on a particular day.<\/p><p> The only thing that would trigger concern would be a family support concern.  For example, if Johan did not come in for two days in a row and nobody contacted the cr&egrave;che, there would be a very supportive phone call to the family to ask whether everything is okay and to ask about what is happening.  If those circumstances arise here or if a parent looks for flexibility, our members' hands are tied because depending on the programme, and the Deputy rightly referred to the complexities involving, four, eight or 12 weeks, the subsidy and fees will go down so providers' hands are tied even as we are encouraging remote working because it is much better for the environment and work-life balance.  Because of the administration of the programmes, our members cannot offer that flexibility to parents when they would love to be able to.  It is really welcome that core funding decouples that.  We would love to see this applied across the board.  We should be focusing on quality and the curriculum and not on attendance.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1122,"content":"<p>Numerous guests have appeared before the committee and have spoken at length about what is almost a pigeon holing of students at second level in terms of options and who that influences their career choices.

We think back to how nursing was perceived in society for many years.  Not many men went into nursing.  Women have had the same issue fighting in the opposite direction.  There were a lot of roles that were gendered as being suitable for men and we have had to overcome a lot of issues.  Childcare and care of any kind is still seen as a role that is primarily taken up by women and is not given the importance and status it needs to have and we need to change that.  We need society to change that discourse and discussion so that it is seen as being suitable for men.  As Mr. O'Connor said, it seems silly to say that it is a wonderful thing to be able to say \"I cared for my children and I spent time with them\" and not be seen as something less than a man.

I thank everyone for their submissions, statements and engagement with the committee.  It has been really helpful and it is good we have a gender balance and that it is not just women discussing childcare which is often the case in these Houses.<\/p> <p>  On practical implementation and on the early childhood education and care recommendations, Ms Byrne noted recommendations No. 8, in particular, and No. 9.  No. 8 (a) is truly radical.  The citizens' assembly has called for a publicly funded, accessible and regulated model of early years and out of hours childcare over the next decade.  My first question, in particular to Ms Byrne and to Mr. O'Connor, is on whether the core funding proposal delivers on that.  I was struck by Ms Byrne's point that if the Government stays on track, it may even surpass those recommendations Nos. 8(a) and 8(b) on the State share of GDP to be spent on childcare.  We hear her point on the specific Oireachtas committee.  It is an interesting additional recommendation that we will certainly consider.  Will core funding deliver and, if not, what else needs to be done to bring about the radical transformation proposed by the citizens' assembly?  I am struck by how rightly critical Ms Byrne and Mr. O'Connor were of the market and its failure to deliver.  Mr. O'Connor put it very starkly not just in giving the average hourly pay of early years educators but also in pointing out that the system is failing staff, parents who lack affordable and sometimes any childcare provision, providers who cannot make ends meet and are faced with the dilemma of having to increase fees if they increase pay and ultimately children from a children's rights perspective.  We are failing everyone involved.<\/p> <p>  I have called for a \"Donogh O'Malley moment\", in that we would start to see early years education and care as a right for every child where every child is guaranteed a State-funded place in the same way that we now see secondary education as a right of every child which the State subsidises, or indeed pays for.  Mr. O'Connor said SIPTU seeks that the Government would assume full responsibility for employee compensation in the sector.  Can we deliver on recommendation No. 8(a) without the State taking that on?  Is it a prerequisite?  How do we get to recommendation No. 8(a)?  Is core funding the right way?  If not, can anything more be done?  We will be providing our report in December when core funding will be in place and hopefully we will have seen a good deal of impact.  How will it look if we get to recommendation No 8(a)?  We have heard of the Nordic countries.  Recently, I looked at the Berlin model of childcare where there is really excellent subsidised childcare which is community provided and often co-operatively provided by parents.  How does it look in practice?  The providers are still providing but with a State subsidy so it is still decentralised provision.  Are the educators all being paid directly by the State as our primary and secondary school teachers are?  <\/p> <p>  I am glad the citizens' assembly referred explicitly to out-of-hours childcare and also after-school care.  I have been that soldier.  It is not just with preschool age children where families need extra support.  It is particularly the case where there is a two-parent family where both parents are working outside the home.  After hours provision is so crucial to enabling women, in particular, to stay in the workforce.  I have seen really interesting academic research that the ten minute journey from school to home is often the thing that takes women out of the workforce because it can be so difficult to access out-of-hours childcare and transport from the school setting to the after-hours provision if it is out of the school.  How do we manage that after school and out-of-hours care?<\/p> <p>   I thank Mr. Peelo for taking us to the other recommendations on social protection and in particular to recommendations Nos. 15 and 16.  I was very interested in his comments.  Will he tell us more about the universal basic income scheme?  Does he think the pilot in the arts sector has potential for expansion?  Could it offer a real lifeline particularly for lone parents?  <\/p> <p>  I thank him for mentioning John O'Mara's case.  He will know I have had a good deal of engagement with John O'Mara and commend him on his courage in going public about his situation and the injustice in our failure to recognise cohabiting couples.  I extend my sympathy with him again on the loss of his partner.  The committee has been very conscious in our deliberations on recommendations Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, about the constitutional recognition for families that are not based on marriage.  That is a really glaring anomaly in our laws and our constitutional and statutory protections.  I want to acknowledge that too.<\/p> <p>  We will go to Ms Byrne first.  I am conscious that there is a lot in what I asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#K00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>No, that is fine.  I hope that I have noted it all.  The Chair might remind me if not.  It is very interesting that she repeated the point about out-of-hours because it was one of the things that I realise we might not have focused on enough in our submission.  There certainly is a role for school age.  We see its provision in other countries where parents are doing night shifts.  That is particularly in a context where both parents might be on night shifts or in a one-parent situation.  The Department has acknowledged that is one of the next things it would like to get to in relation to the national childcare scheme.  That would be very welcome.  It happens.  There are informal systems in place but it is important in that not everyone works from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  It is really good that the citizens' assembly recognised that.  It goes back to a child-centred, family-centred system that would bring as many possibilities into the equation.  I fully agree with that.<\/p> <p>  The Chair's questions on core funding are really challenging.  We do not yet know if settings will sign up in their droves.  We are all waiting to see and providers are waiting to get the contracts which they are due to get this month.  As my colleague from Big Start said, the proposed pay scale has only just been published so all that has to be digested and considered.  Presumably people in the Department are working away on the calculations around all of that.<\/p> <p>  On the question of what happens if it does not go through, it will be really stark.  We have asked the Department and the Minister repeatedly.  We do not want it to fail but if it does, we have asked if there is a plan B.  The answer is \"No.\"  That is quite worrying.  We have to be positive and hope that it will go through.  The next thing that needs to happen is that it becomes multi-annual.  We absolutely welcome core funding.  We welcomed Nurturing Skills and Partnership for the Public Good, the two big reports which are now public policy for early years and school-age care.  For full disclosure, we were heavily involved in Nurturing Skills and somewhat involved on the funding model report where there were consultations with Frontier Economics.  Obviously if we did not like the outcomes, we would be suitably critical.  We absolutely do.  However, Early Childhood Ireland would suggest that one reason some providers have been quite unhappy, rattled and concerned about the core funding is that it has not been accompanies by a vision that brings the two major reports together and describes the journey that Ireland will go on.  I would love for the Minister to answer all of the Chair's questions to describe the next five years.  Prior to this year's budget announcement in October, this is what we looked for.  We urged the Government to increase funding but also describe what it was going to do for the next five years.  We think that would give certainty to the sector, and crucially to parents, which is very important.  If you are a parent in the beloved Nordic countries or, indeed, Germany, France or other countries at the higher level of public investment, the one thing that you have that new parents in Ireland do not have is certainty.  You know exactly how much money you will get and whether it will be split in a two-parent family between both parents and what will happen when the parents return to work.<\/p><p>In Ireland, apart from the six months of paid maternity and some paid paternity leave, the statutory leave, and the Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE, programme which is part-time for 38 weeks over two years, a person has no certainty.  It would be very important - this goes back to the point that we have repeatedly made like broken records - and to be very fair to the Government which has made these commitments, that we are not starting with a brownfield site.  It is all the more important that the Government describes the next five years so that we cannot use that language of the X factor etc., but to go on and to describe a journey so that people have certainty about what the ultimate destination is and what it will look like.  <\/p><p> Is the State, as SIPTU has urged, to take over the payment of staff and what are the implications of that?  The State is quite right to describe and support continuous professional development, and so on, and so it should, just like it does with teachers, and so forth.  We need the wider vision and certainty.  When the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stand up in the D&aacute;il to speak, there are untouchables - the social welfare bill has to be paid every year as do teachers&rsquo; wages.  That is the certainty.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth needs to have a Vote with a tick which we all take for granted, and the discussion should then be about how much more the State will do and what impact that will have on fees etc.  The overall direction of travel is very good.  It is about the bringing together of the two major reports and what that is going to look like and it is very important that the Government is describing that, as well as its vision.  <\/p><p> It is also very important to acknowledge that childminders and school age childcare are both being brought into regulation which is very welcome.  With child minders this is happening more slowly and, quite rightly, not with the same onerous regulation that other settings have.  That is very important and it is sometimes forgotten that in the Nordic countries, childminders are also part of the picture.  They are brought into professionalisation in rural areas or for families with very particular needs, be that because of the needs of the child or the labour market needs of the family out of hours.  They are a very important part of the system and it is important also to acknowledge that and school-age childcare also.  It is very good that the Government is keeping many balls in the air on all of that but it would be wonderful, remarkable, and reassuring to everybody who is involved if the Government were to produce a five-year plan of what is going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>That is very clear and I thank Ms Byrne.  I turn to Mr. O&rsquo;Connor now and I commend him and SIPTU on the very important work in highlighting the pay and conditions for so many of those in the sector.  I visited early years centres in Limerick recently and heard his point exactly that those who are training early years educators at University of Limerick said that very few of the class they train will go on to work in the childcare early years sector and settings.  They go elsewhere and do not work in the sector because of low pay and poor conditions.  I also greatly welcome the early years joint labour committee which he referred to.<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of the core funding model; will it deliver, what else needs to be done and who pays?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#L00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>We welcomed core funding.  There is agreement as to what the problem is among many people within the sector and there is also broad agreement on what the vision is.  It is to have a high quality, affordable, and accessible service.  One must then get into the nuts and bolts of it.  Core funding certainly looks like it addresses the fundamental barrier to solving the early years problems in the country, which is that if one is going to pump money in, how does one know that it delivers?  If one accepts that point, it opens up the path to solving it.  Core funding looks like it solves that and we are very optimistic about it.  It does this because it is indirectly covering pay.  A chunk of money is provided for pay and we go off to do the pay deal; that is happening.<\/p> <p>  There was also the introduction of the fee freeze.  One might ask what good is the fee freeze to parents because these fees are being frozen at very high rates.  It has been very well signalled now by a number of Ministers that they are going to ramp up the subsidies in subsequent budgets.  It looks like they have a system now where we can put money in and achieve our goals.  We will see how it all comes out in the wash but we would be optimistic that a big piece of the jigsaw has been put in place.<\/p> <p>  There are two other things I would highlight.  Part of what Ms Byrne was talking about is around provision.  What is the shape of the sector?   Where are the providers, how big are they, and how long are they open?  Are they open at night and open during the day for shift work and all of those kinds of issues?  That is the next phase of the debate which we need to get into.  Who pays for this?  Services need to increase their fees to be able to get all that money in order to have capital investment but one is then compromising the affordability piece.  We would need to have a look at capital investment by the State.  There is then the question that if the State is going to pay for buildings who should own them?  Should the State own them?  This sounds like a fairly familiar story.  In areas of very high demand where one cannot get a place for either love or money, one can ask whether the State should be building there or making some kind of capital investment.  That is a very interesting discussion and is going to be the next phase of the debate as we go on.  That is, of course, all a question of money and whether it is there on the part of the State.<\/p> <p>  This is all underpinned in a way by the values within the sector.  For those who are working on it, including the vast majority of providers, they are there to deliver good quality for their children and not because they are making tonnes of money from it; this is what they want to do and have a passion for.  That informs a good chunk of the sector.  We know and can look over to England, New Zealand and Australia to see what happens when it becomes commodified and when international investment funds get their claws into the sector.  They are there to maximise profit and are able to bring a great deal of political pressure to change the rules and laws to suit themselves also.  <\/p> <p>  We are at a defining moment as to what this is.  We talk about the direction, whether core funding is good, and where the buildings are but it is also a question of the values underpinning this and the vision, which may not be talked about.  Is it a free-market free-for-all.  I do not believe we are going that way but let us refine our approach to see where we are going.  Is it publicly funded or is it publicly provided?  These are two very different things and we seem to be taking something of the middle path.  Wherever we are starting from here, that is probably the direction we need to get to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>I have two other colleagues who wish to join the discussion: Deputy Hourigan and Senator Doherty.

We must ensure it is equal for everybody at the point of access.<\/p> <p>  On the question the Chairman asked me around recommendations Nos..15 and 16 and the universal basic income, I will defer to Ms Roche on that because she would have greater speciality in that area.  Treoir is asking that social welfare rates are benchmarked against the minimum essential standard of living which has already been calculated by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which has done exceptional work in this area.

I will focus on the area of early years and integrated disability provision or the recognition of integrated services in the sector because I guess that it is a challenge.  My experience is that early years education has been an incredibly useful and beneficial service for many children and starts the process of a fully integrated educational experience or childcare setting experience.  I am mindful of what I have heard in the past while regarding the level of uncertainty and the need for certainty in the area.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the thoughts of witnesses on what we need if we were to provide in every early learning or early child care setting truly integrated service provision for families who need it.  There would be a knock-on effect throughout a family when a child with additional needs receives good child care.  What do we need to put in place?  What certainty would the Government need to put in place in terms of training for staff?  How much funding is needed to pay for capital costs to provide accommodation?  Is there a different requirement in terms of capital costs?  Are more extensive capital costs required to provide extra facilities or particular rooms?  <\/p> <p>  One of the previous speakers mentioned the public-private model.  Is there a trepidation or worry about the pubic-private model being able to provide services?  Do the witnesses think that a profit-driven model can truly provide services?<\/p> <p>  Finally, how can more extended therapies be linked with publicly provided service provision?  Many children need occupational therapy or speech and language therapy and parents are told to find such therapies through a community liaison point and not necessarily in the childcare or educational setting.

Yes, she missed an earlier intervention about AIM, which is a programme that she is aware of.  The model is only available through ECCE and, therefore, is only available to a cohort of children albeit 98% of 3-year-olds avail of an ECCE place.  The Department is very keen to look at the 2% who do not avail of ECCE and that certainly speaks to some of the issues that the Deputy has mentioned but also speaks to very marginalised children who are Traveller and Roma children.  Our members are very conscious of the need to be involved in local interventions, which brings me to her last point.  We have members who are informally involved in what might be described, and certainly would be so described in Nordic counties, as a family support framework.  Our members attend case management meetings for children for whom there may well be State involvement already and-or it could be exactly what the Deputy has described around occupational therapy and so on.  That work is done because there are great local people be they in State services or, dare I say it, among our membership or both.  All of that work should be formalised and the First Five strategy, which is a national strategy, speaks to that.<br\/><br\/>We are very conscious that we have members who have delivered, particularly preschool education, since the 1950s and 1960s.  Indeed, to be gendered again, we have a couple of members who are granddaughters running what was their grandmother's cr&egrave;che.  We also have many adult daughters who now run the cr&egrave;che that belonged to their mother.  These people always describe their work as a service and never as a business.  Unfortunately, some of these facilities are physically very unsuitable for children who might have disabilities and our members are very conscious of that.<br\/><br\/>One of the great things that we saw happen during Covid, which the Department gave capital funding for, was the development of more outdoor spaces.  When cr&egrave;ches first opened at the end of June parents were not allowed to physically set foot in a cr&egrave;che for public health reasons.  Our members, and we are delighted to share all of this on social media and beyond, with capital funding created amazing outdoor spaces for the handover and the handover is so important in terms of relationships and quality care for children.  Of course, in circumstances where children had not been in a cr&egrave;che for three or four months that handover was even more important.  We urge that more focus is placed on outdoor spaces.  Our members are very supportive of that and want to facilitate same so the Deputy is correct to identify outdoor spaces and it is a way to include all children of all abilities.<br\/><br\/>Another thing that she missed is that we really welcomed, in the context of partnership for the public good, the funding model report because it states that the AIM model should be extended, with which we agree, because there are parents who worry over the summer period.  It is crazy that a child in a full daycare <font color=\"#202124\">cr&egrave;che<\/font>has his or her AIM support cut off when ECCE finishes in the morning.  Such a situation does not make sense.  When you say that to people from other countries they look at you as if you have lost the plot and we have not.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I wish to mention another important issue.  A few years ago the Department commissioned a study on universal design on which we were very happy to work.  We formed a consortium with other colleagues and then together the National Disability Authority and the Department commissioned the work.  A copy of the report is available in hard copy and online.  It is another moment when the sector was very proud that we led the way on universal design.

The frustration is that we are having the same conversations year in, year out.  I say that as a person who was at the table in the Department of Social Protection five or six years ago.  To my mind, the wheels of change are very slow.  It feels like official Ireland and the patriarchal country that we still live in, whether we like it or not, does not really want the system to change.  I recall attending meetings of the European Council with Norwegian, Finnish, Danish and Swedish colleagues who were a generation ahead of us with regard to childcare and gender equality.  I always railed against the fact we linked the services we offered women, whether in the workplace or the home, the services we offered children, the interventions from an early perspective and the benefits that we got from women's participation in the workforce.  It was done years ago, and a system was enforced where women went back to work so that other women could be paid poorly to mind their children without any regard for the impact on the child.  That does not seem like a long time ago.  I am of the view that the children should be first and centre, before the gender equality part.  I am aware that one comes with the other.  I note there is talk of establishing childcare educational campuses in our towns and communities, based off the back of State-owned facilities such as our schools and some larger community cr&egrave;ches.  Why can we not advance that model, while still supporting the private home-from-home type model that we have enjoyed for many years in this country? I wonder what the witnesses think of us developing that childcare education campus model in all of our towns and villages.  The biggest obstacle to achieving that is the fact that while as a State we pay for the development of the schools and the running of them, we do not own the buildings, and therefore do not control the usage of them.  How do the witnesses feel we can get around that particular issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>That is not an easy question, but it is a most important one.

Of course, some will be looking to the local schools and wondering why they cannot build there.  The educational campus model sounds really interesting.  The Senator has hit the nail on the head.  The biggest problem is that the State does not own the buildings.  We cannot say that we are going to build a cr&egrave;che in a particular location.  I do not know how we overcome that obstacle, unless there is a lot of engagement and persuasion to ensure that we bring people along with the idea.  The way the system is structured at the moment, the boards of management of schools have ultimate discretion as to how the buildings are used.  As a model and an idea, the educational campus model seems like an obvious solution if we need more services and we are going to have to build them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>Like Mr. O'Connor, I was not aware of the educational campus model.  However, as to how I envisage it, I can see huge advantages to such a model that is accessible and available at a local level.  I do not intend to rehash the discussion we had earlier on ownership.  We are going through issues of ownership with the new national maternity hospital.  Questions are being raised about land, who owns land and how we can build on it.  As Mr. O'Connor rightly pointed out, the discussion on the need and desire for the service outweighs the issue of who owns the facilities.  While still trying to change that model of ownership, I think we can get round most things.  The State owns property and land.  When the State is publicly funding services and has a value-based system around what it is trying to achieve, people are willing to come on board with that.  However, it is a difficult task and it requires us to think about it.  I do not have the answers right now, but I think it is an interesting model to explore.  We must look at how to engage with that and how to bring people on board with that model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Peelo"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>In Early Childhood Ireland, we look at the issue through two lenses.  The first is the child-centred lens.  I think some of my colleagues would run a mile if they heard the word \"campus\" being used.  I know that there has been a debate on the issue in bigger countries, such as the US.  I have seen the debates myself.  I am aware that AT&amp;T and other big employers opened work-based cr&egrave;ches and there were certainly questions as to whether that was a very child-centred approach and whether they were the best places to have cr&egrave;ches.  I think Senator Doherty's point was more about schools and using existing school buildings.  Of course, it is important to acknowledge that pre-school and after-school services are provided in many of the national schools across the country.<\/p> <p>  The second point we would make is that because of the lack of planning and because there is nobody with oversight of that piece in the same way there is within the Department of Education, we are advocating for the establishment of the single agency of childcare Ireland to be established as soon as possible.  There are crazy situations where a local school will decide to provide services.  I am not criticising the schools.  Often, such decisions are taken for the best of reasons.  Much of the time it is to support children whose parents are coming and going for transport reasons and for work reasons and might have difficulties showing up at school time and so on.  The school will offer a service to parents and open a breakfast club or after-school club, when there is a perfectly good cr&egrave;che down the road that has been operating for 30 years.  Suddenly, competition is being introduced.  That is why we need planning.  We need proper planning through the single agency to look at a particular area and see if the provision of services by schools is feasible.  I am not referring to feasibility from a financial point of view.  We want public funding going into the sector.  The State is funding more and more services, as it should, and it fully funds pre-schools.  It is important to say that the ECCE scheme is fully funded.  We also have the national childcare scheme and core funding will be introduced.  However, we are allowing further development down the road when we know, for example, there are two housing estates in the area and the three-year-olds are going to grow up and we are going to have two cr&egrave;ches.  I hope the Senator sees the point I am making.  I absolutely hear the Senator.  However, it goes back to the previous point.  This is not brownfielding Ireland.  There are big challenges.<\/p> <p>  We have had pre-schools in Ireland since the 1950s.  Now we have multiple models.  Many of the models are really child- and family-centred.  Families have engaged with them, whether it is out of choice or because they are looking at the system and becoming aware that it is the reality.  Families have engaged with them.  That needs to be brought into our conversations and deliberations about future planning.  I get the fact that school buildings are empty in the afternoons and evenings.  That absolutely needs to be part of the national conversation that we need to have about the issue, as my colleague from SIPTU has described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>Does Senator Doherty have any further follow-up questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N01000","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>No, that is great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N01100","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1168,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Clarke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#N01200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>We spoke about affordability and availability.  I want to return to the accessibility part, particularly outside our major cities.  If we are looking at a five-year plan, if we want to be able to give parents certainty and if we are committing to a vision of where we want to be a number of years hence, one of the biggest issues in terms of accessibility is how the child physically gets from the school to the after-school place.  The Chair touched on this earlier.  Would there be merit in extending the school transport scheme to include not just the child's primary residence, and the criteria that are there are very limited, but also where the child goes to after school, if only for that single journey from the school to the aftercare providers and perhaps not necessarily home if the parent is going to be collecting?  It is simply to get the child from the school to the after-school place because otherwise it is not going to be physically possible.  My constituency is Longford-Westmeath.  There are plenty of parents who live in Longford and work in Athlone or who live in Athlone and work in Mullingar.  That is a 45-minute to an hour journey and there is simply no way that a parent is going to be able to get from a school gate to an aftercare provider and then back to work within a lunch hour.  The witnesses' opinion on that would be much appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022060200002#O00100","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1170,"content":"<p>That is an important and practical question.  I will add another before I give you all the last word.  It is on the point about accessibility in settings.  It is also a very gendered point.  We have spoken about workplace cr&egrave;ches in childcare and there was a lot of debate in different workplaces about having workplace cr&egrave;ches and childcare.  The difficulty is that if it is typically in the woman's workplace the responsibility is always on the mother to do the pick-up and drop-off.  It may not be in the best interests of the child or, indeed, of the family because if there is a two-parent family, the father will not be involved in the pick-up or drop-off and will not be rung by the childcare provider.  It comes back to the point Deputy Clarke is making about where parents have a long commute.  This is a major issue in commuter counties around Dublin too, more generally.  Should the cr&egrave;che or childcare facility be near the workplace, the home or the school?  Do you have any thoughts on that?  There is a very interesting gendered point about which of the parents in a two-parent family is going to be responsible for the cr&egrave;che drop-off and pick-up.  It is a crucial, practical point.<\/p> <p>  I will call Ms Byrne first, followed by Mr. Peelo and Mr. O'Connor.

If it is ten minutes or five minutes, as it can be in cities or suburbs, the children cannot bring themselves so many cr&egrave;che-branded minibuses try to do that, particularly in the cities.  Cr&egrave;ches have been addressing it, as have schools.  There has been some collaboration.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is hitting on an important point because it is not just about what happens within the cr&egrave;che, although all of that is very important.  Again, it goes back to planning.  There must be consideration in a rural context, in particular, because of distances and so forth, and that is part of the overall picture, whether that is the Department recognising that through capital funding or the three Departments - Education, Transport and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth - coming together to realise it.  We are about to invest and we are optimistic, as my colleague from Big Start is, that the core funding is the beginning of major transformation, and that absolutely must be brought into the equation as well.<\/p> <p>  There is a gender dimension, of course, and I was going to say it earlier.  Sometimes we talk up the Nordic countries.  I have colleagues and friends who roll their eyes at Irish women, in particular, and say that with all the equality they have, they still get the telephone call from the cr&egrave;che.  My male partner does not get the telephone call from the cr&egrave;che.  I get it, even though the cr&egrave;che has both names, and the expectation is that I will drop everything.  I am not criticising the cr&egrave;che.  It goes back to the societal point.  This is hugely gendered, but it is important.<\/p> <p>  If we are moving towards, as we should and as we have seen, strides being made in respect of urban and rural transport and consideration being given to walking and cycling, obviously all of that has to be done under supervision.

As a parent who has suffered from the anxiety of trying to get to the cr&egrave;che before it closes, arriving to find the child waiting with all the gear and I am the last parent to arrive and getting a little tick because I am late, I know the stress of the distance to travel across the city with traffic.  That creates huge anxiety.  One of the issues is the accessibility of the cr&egrave;ches and whether they are closer to work.  I accept that if it is closer to one parent's area, it is usually that parent who picks up and the other parent does not get that interaction.  If it is too far away, there are all those other issues.  It is about the flexibility of cr&egrave;ches being available beyond the 6.30 p.m. shut-off, when one's child is dressed and ready to go because every other child is leaving and the parent is late.  That creates its own stress for the child and for the parents.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy about extending the school transport scheme to look at this.  It would be very interesting.  As Ms Byrne said, many cr&egrave;ches have had to offer pick-up from school as part of their service.  They do not tend to drop home.  The pick-up from schools and its extension and seeing this as an educational support as well as a childcare support would be very interesting to take on.  I am in the situation where there are two parents and we have transport.

The first key point to make is that from the mid 1980s onwards we have been guided by the principle of close co-operation between the Irish and British Governments on all the aspects I mentioned, from the Anglo-Irish Agreement right through to the Good Friday Agreement.  The road we travelled together was not always easy but, nevertheless, the two Governments were the motor.  That applies particularly to the lengthy negotiations, which eventually reached culmination on Good Friday 1998.<\/p><p> It would be fair to say that in the summer of 1997 we reached a turning point with the arrival of two new Administrations in Dublin and London, which had solid majorities and which were in a position to give fresh impetus to the partnership.  These were led, as we all know, by Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair, respectively.  That created favourable conditions for the restoration of the IRA ceasefire in the summer of 1997 and for the convening of all-party talks, with everybody at the table for the first time, on substance.  We had previously had a large grouping of the parties in 1996 but at a point where we had not yet got the substance.  As of September 1997 we were finally able to get to substantive talks with everybody at the table.<\/p><p> Another confidence-building factor was the availability of George Mitchell as an independent mediator and chair for the talks along with his two colleagues.  Most importantly, we had the presence of President Clinton behind the scenes.  He was, as the members will know, a remarkable asset because he was a president with an unrivalled knowledge of the Northern Ireland situation going back quite a while and an unrivalled interest in the developments.  He worked very closely with the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of the day.  I often think of him as a third partner to those negotiations.  We were blessed in a sense with those happy developments as of the summer of 1997.<\/p><p> We had set out in two landmark documents a few years earlier a joint understanding between the British and Irish Governments of how constitutional issues would be articulated in the future agreement we were aiming at.  These documents, as the members will know, were the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993 and the Joint Framework Document of February 1995.  Between them, those two documents, in a sense, were trying to demonstrate to republicans that if they were to abandon violence and commit absolutely to peaceful politics, they could take part in a comprehensive talks process, which would validate Irish unity as a legitimate political objective and would also ensure a level playing field for people of both traditions, in a careful balancing of two key concepts, namely, self-determination and consent.  The two Governments agreed the people of Ireland had a right to self-determination but the way in which this right was exercised would be subject to the principle of consent.  It was a complex concept but one which married positions that were important to people of the two main traditions.  It provided the basis for us to move towards the more operational end of the negotiations, getting into a potential agreement, which would cover the three strands, various institutions and human rights concepts, including equality.  We had to first get the constitutional issues right and get them into a position which would be acceptable on both sides.  We did that with those two documents and that opened the way for what eventually became the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> I do not have much time to go into the decommissioning of weapons but there is no doubt it stymied our efforts for several years.  We, on the Irish Government side, found it simply impossible to accept this as a legitimate issue to be resolved in advance of negotiations.  We could understand there would be an expectation that weapons would be eventually decommissioned as part of a new political dynamic but we could not accept that it would be made a precondition for taking part in negotiations to begin with.  Suffice to say, that bedevilled our efforts for quite a while.  If I were to tot it up, we probably spent 18 months or two years trying to find a way around this decommissioning blockage, a blockage which the British Government contributed to erecting.  This was prior to the Blair Government.  However, eventually we found a way by the autumn of 1997, which enabled decommissioning to be handled in a separate sub-committee of the negotiations.  We still had to keep an eye on it and it would come back to haunt us from time to time but it was essentially handled apart from the main negotiations.  That meant that as of September 1997 we were pointing towards a substantive agreement which eventually came.  I will leave it at that because I know I have only five minutes at my disposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1185,"content":"<p>Please continue.

I will make another few points.  The framework document, which was negotiated largely under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party Government in the mid-1990s and was published under the new Government in early 1995, in effect, was a template that we, on the Irish Government side, saw for the future agreement.  That did not mean we had in mind that every single comma and adjective would be included in the agreement but it set out, nevertheless, a range of understandings on the constitutional side and on the institutional side, which we felt would have to be part of a future agreement if changes to if changes to Articles 2 and 3 were to be expected as a consequence.  Of course, all along the unionists wanted to see Articles 2 and 3 changed.  We recognised that but we, in turn, knew there would be no possible majority in a referendum situation in this jurisdiction and in the North unless there were politically significant North-South bodies, including executive powers.  We could not just have casual or insignificant structures.  We had to have something that really made an impact, which had both a practical value and also was politically robust.  We knew what sort of North-South bodies we needed as the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for constitutional change and all of that was in the framework document.  The British Government, generally speaking, was of the same mind.  From time to time, it was a little more reticent in attaching itself publicly to the framework document, but it knew it was basically the blueprint for what would come out of the negotiations.  When Easter week eventually arrived, and it come down to a final hectic, sometimes confused, few days, we were not sitting around a table, as we would be here.  It did not involve formal negotiations, as one might imagine.  There were eight parties there.  There were two Governments.<\/p><p>It was presided over by George Mitchell and his two colleagues.  One might imagine that with that number of players and people one would have to have a more formal set-up, but the truth is that the deals were being done in small bilateral or trilateral settings.  That is often the way it has to be.  We deliberately engineered a kind of pressure cooker situation in Castle Buildings in the final few days, from about the Tuesday onwards, because it was clear that while we had the two Heads of Government there, they would not be there forever.  Easter was also a deadline.  George Mitchell had made clear it was a deadline for him personally so in a sense, it was now or never.  We could, in theory, have gone on beyond Easter but the political dynamics were such that we knew we would have to finish for Easter.  We did not quite finish within the deadline George Mitchell had in mind, which was Holy Thursday at midnight.  We went into the Friday but overall, we managed to stick to the programme.<\/p><p> One reason that formal negotiations around a table would not have worked is that people were inclined to grandstand - no big surprise there - especially if they felt there was a media angle.  People were inclined to read out party positions or governmental positions and that was not a place in which one could do deals and reach compromises so we had to go for the more informal setting.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  I do not want to take up all of the time and will make way for Mr. Montgomery.  To start the ball rolling, I just thought I would make those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and Mr. Donoghue.  I am glad to be here with members of the committee and others who are joining the meeting from afar.  By way of background, I worked on Northern Ireland affairs in the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of the Taoiseach from 1993 to 2001.  Therefore, I was very much involved in the preparations for the negotiations and during the negotiations themselves I did a lot of work on drafting around the constitutional and institutional issues in particular.  Then I spent the three years after the negotiation of the agreement working on the North-South institutions and trying to find a basis for the institutions to go live.  I then went off to other places, principally the EU, but my last few years in the public service were dominated and dogged by Brexit.  I was the lead official on Brexit in the Taoiseach's Department for a couple of years and then in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I found myself reacquainted with Northern Ireland more than I might have expected to be when I worked in EU matters.<\/p> <p>  Since my retirement three years ago, I have developed a number of connections with Northern Ireland.  In particular, I am an honorary professor at the Mitchell Institute at Queen's University Belfast and am also on the steering committee of a project being run by the Royal Irish Academy and the University of Notre Dame called Analysing and Researching Ireland North and South, ARINS.  We have published around 20 or 25 academic articles on all sorts of aspects of the future of Ireland, some directly related to the question of constitutional change and others not. <\/p> <p>  On a personal note, my parents are both originally from Northern Ireland.  They have lived in the Republic since they went to university here.  They are both 90 years of age so they have lived here a long time but still have close connections with Northern Ireland.  By coincidence, my son is now living in Belfast.  He is married to a woman from Belfast and I have a little nine-month-old Northern Ireland grandson, whom I met this morning, so I have a strong sense of a stake in the place.<\/p> <p>  I submitted a longer paper to the committee containing some reflections on the negotiations.  I also circulated the text of a lecture I gave at Queen's University last year which was specifically on the question of what the Good Friday Agreement does and does not say about a united Ireland.  That, in turn, was based on an academic article I had published by the Royal Irish Academy.  I knew coming in here of the approach that Mr. Donoghue was planning to take and Mr. O'Connor very kindly shared his paper with me so I decided not to go at things in a chronological way but to make some personal reflections which are entirely incomplete and not comprehensive.  They benefit from hindsight, which makes us all wiser but I hope they will be useful.<\/p> <p>  The first point I would make is that talk of a peace process can often be misleading.  It is a misnomer.  There was no single or singular peace process.  There were quite different streams which flowed together into the final Good Friday Agreement.  Going right back to Sunningdale, through the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Brooke-Mayhew talks in the early 1990s, there was a whole series of attempts to establish institutions within Northern Ireland and, to some degree, North-South institutions as well.  In that context, we can see that what happened in the early 1990s was very important.  There was an acceptance on all sides of the need for a three-strand approach.  At the same time, the question of constitutional change in the Republic as part of a deal came very much to the fore.  Of course, the unionist desire to see the Anglo-Irish Agreement superseded was also very important.  That is one whole stream.<\/p> <p>  The second stream, of course, was a peace process more narrowly defined as the bringing to an end of violence.  I refer to violence by paramilitaries in particular but also the various elements of State violence which were the consequence of that.  Obviously, the maintenance of peace was hugely important but there were other issues such as the position of prisoners, the question of decommissioning, which Mr. Donoghue mentioned, the question of demilitarisation, the scaling back of military installations and so on.  That was a separate stream of issues.<\/p> <p>  Third, in the 1990s in particular there had been substantial progress on areas of human rights and, in particular, fair employment.  Northern Ireland was becoming a more equal and less discriminatory place through the 1990s.  It was still a long way away from where it has got to since but certainly progress was made.  Then we had strong voices in favour of policing reform, arguing that it was fundamentally essential.  Above all, Mr. Seamus Mallon was the voice of that but prominent members of the Catholic Church and the Irish Government were also very strong on it.  Finally, from the early 1990s onwards, the whole concept of the North-South economy or the all-island economy began to grow, led by business leaders such as the late Sir George Quigley as well as the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC.  <\/p> <p>  There were five different streams and they all fed in together and contributed in different ways.  I am not saying they can be distinguished clearly, one from the other, in the end.  I am being a bit schematic but they all had different origins and roots and they came together in the end.  An important point to make is that the different players had different priorities.  Some were focused on certain aspects of the negotiations, while some focused on other aspects.  The unionists for their part were primarily interested in the ending of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and, in particular, Mr. Donoghue's secretariat.  They also wanted to see changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, which had come back into focus because there was a judgment in the Supreme Court in a case taken by the McGimpsey brothers, who were unionists.  They argued that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was a violation of the Irish Constitution because of what it said about consent.  The Supreme Court, while rejecting their case, said nonetheless that unification was a \"constitutional imperative\".  That became a major issue for the unionists.  They realised that the price they would have to pay for this would be power-sharing arrangements within Northern Ireland and North-South institutions.  They were open to that but it is fair to say that they were a lot less enthusiastic about either of those things than the SDLP.  The SDLP was the great champion of strong power-sharing institutions and strong North-South institutions as a balance and it is fair to say that the Alliance was in the same space.  It also had an interest in rights, policing and other such matters.<\/p> <p>  The third major party around the table at the end of the negotiations was Sinn F&eacute;in.  The interesting thing was that for Sinn F&eacute;in, being present at the table was extraordinarily important.  The recognition of its democratic mandate was hugely important.  However, the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in could not accept, intellectually or politically, the premise that there would be a continuing entity called Northern Ireland meant that it did not engage in any meaningful way in negotiations either on strand one institutions or on the North-South institutions.  This is an important point.  Bit by bit, there was an acceptance in practice that these institutions would exist and had to exist but this was not Sinn F&eacute;in's focus.  Its focus was, above all, on the second stream of issues, that is, the consequences of the end of violence.  Above all, it was concerned about prisoner release and about avoiding explicit commitments and action on decommissioning.<\/p><p>Those were its principal interests.  It was, of course, interested in equality issues and the question of a future united Ireland.  It is important to make the point that most of the institutional discussions involving the parties included the UUP and the SDLP, other parties, to a lesser extent, and the two Governments.<\/p><p> As I was saying, the different elements of the agreement had very deep roots.  Many people and organisations contributed over the years and decades.  If you were to meet my friend Mr. Jonathan Powell, who is a member of the Mitchell Institute, as I am, you might believe it all began on the Tuesday of Holy Week when Tony Blair arrived in Northern Ireland or, at the earliest, when Tony Blair was elected in May 1997.  In fact, as we know, the process took much longer.  There was a slow process between June 1996 and March 1998.  Senator Mitchell and his team did a fantastic job in holding the ring and making the public case for the effort.  As Mr. Donoghue said, there was then a sprint at the end of the marathon.  It is almost impossible to exaggerate the extent to which things were chaotic and confused for the reasons Mr. Donoghue mentioned.  I have been involved in many negotiations since, including at EU level, and that is how deals get done.  They are a combination of fatigue, confusion and adrenaline, and the sense that the time has come.<\/p><p> Discussions were largely unco-ordinated.  Only the Governments had an overview of what was happening.  Representatives of the UUP and the SDLP were in one room talking about strand one.  The Irish Government was talking to the UUP about strand two.  Sinn F&eacute;in was talking to the British and Irish Governments about prisoners and decommissioning, etc.  This near chaos, this fog of war, is almost typical of negotiating endgames but it means issues can be left unclear.  There can be creative ambiguity but at times there can also be uncreative ambiguity, if you like, and a lack of clarity.  It is bizarre.  To give a couple of examples, the broad constitutional principles, as Mr. Donoghue said, had largely been settled between the two Governments in advance.  There were three different constitutional aspects of the settlement.  There were changes to Articles 2 and 3 and the British constitutional legislation, including provision for a future referendum, and the constitutional section of the agreement itself.  Those three elements were never looked at together in the round.  It means there is a bizarre situation in that the Irish Government has no role whatsoever in a formal sense in calling a referendum.  Many people, even in the South, appear to misunderstand that.  Of course, for political reasons the South would have to have a role in that regard but it is a strange gap in the agreement, to take one example.<\/p><p> There is an idea that those involved knew what they were doing in every case.  I remember when the unionists reacted furiously to Chris Patten's recommendations on policing.  Patten asked what did they think they were signing up to, to which my reply would be that they did not know what they were signing up to.  The focus was so heavily on some other matters that the policing texts were drafted between the two Governments and the unionists never read them clearly and did not know what they were signing up to.<\/p><p> It is also worth recognising that while it is a legal text, only the section on constitutional issues is written in legal language.  Only that section would resemble, for example, an EU treaty.  Much of the rest of the agreement includes broad parameters that would be fleshed out through further negotiation between North and South.  Other aspects, such as policing, would require future investigation.  There were also statements of aspiration on symbolism and so on.  There was sometimes a lack of clear elements in the agreement.  I am not saying that was avoidable because it could not have been otherwise but I make that point.<\/p><p> Looking back, it is interesting that some of the issues that have come to the fore in the intervening years got relatively little attention during the process.  An enormous amount of attention was paid to North-South issues and structures.  I was very much involved in those negotiations, as was Mr. Donoghue.  I remember being in Downing Street for two or three days the week before the agreement, with Dermot Gallagher and Paddy Teahon of the Department of the Taoiseach and our British opposite numbers.  We were working on texts to be given to the parties.  That was taking a considerable amount of attention and was politically important for the SDLP and the Irish Government from, if you like, an offensive point of view, and very important for the unionists from a defensive point of view.  Far more attention was paid to those structures than was paid to many of the finer details as to how the Assembly and Executive would work.  Broad principles were certainly set out but how the developments might intersect was never thought through.  I do not think an agreement of a different kind could have been reached but I make that point.<\/p><p> Little or nothing was said about legacy issues, reconciliation or anti-sectarianism, which is interesting.  That was partly because not everything could be discussed but it was also because, as I have confirmed with some members of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, there was a sense that those issues would look after themselves if the political structures were in place.  They were also considered soft issues, even women's issues possibly.  They were to do with sentiment rather than hard constitutional language and so on.  That is an interesting point.  Many people would also feel that socioeconomic issues were not given the weight they might have been.  Was that a realistic possibility?  I do not know.<\/p><p> It is important to note that at the time, there was no need to say anything whatever about the places of Britain and Ireland within the European Union.  The agreement states nothing, good or bad, about the Border.  It states nothing about the place of Northern Ireland within the UK internal market.  It was simply regarded as entirely unnecessary to include such references.  Therefore, while either side can appeal to the spirit of the agreement, they cannot appeal to the letter of the agreement when it comes to Brexit.<\/p><p> This was an inclusive process in the sense that it included every party with an electoral mandate from the 1996 Northern Ireland Forum elections.  Every party that had rejected violence and committed to the Mitchell principles was entitled to be present.  However, at no point in the talks were all of the major parties represented at the same time.  Sinn F&eacute;in was excluded from June 1996 to September 1997 in the wake of the bombing of Canary Wharf at the end of the IRA's first ceasefire.  The two Governments found a basis on which to get Sinn F&eacute;in into the talks and when that happened, the DUP and the UK Unionist Party, led by Robert McCartney, walked out.  Mr. McCartney was an eloquent and fluent figure albeit he represented a minority view.  The consequence was that unionism was, in a way, under-represented in the final stages of the negotiations.  One would have to say that the constant attacks of the DUP on the process and the outcome destroyed any prospect of broad unionist consensus in favour of the agreement.  It is reasonable to ask if there would have been an agreement had the DUP been present and it is probable there would not have been.  However, the absence of its representatives was destructive.  There is no question about it.  We must remember that while people talk about the 71% of Northern Irish voters who voted in favour of the agreement, only a bare majority of unionists, if that, voted for it.  In the Assembly elections of June 1998, a majority of the MLAs returned were anti-agreement.  That included a number of members of the UUP, principally Jeffrey Donaldson and Arlene Foster, who remained in the UUP for years but were constantly working against David Trimble.<\/p><p> As Mr. Donoghue said, we do not want to go over the long story of decommissioning.  For good reason, dealing with the issue was repeatedly delayed.  Many people forget that Senator Mitchell came back for two months in the autumn of 1999 to try to find a basis on which the institutions could go live.  On the basis of his intensive discussions, he confirmed a firm expectation at the end of November 1999 that decommissioning would begin immediately after the institutions were put in place.  It was on that basis that David Trimble jumped.  That expectation was, of course, disappointed.  One could argue as to whether that was inevitable or otherwise.  Some things were done by the unionists which made it more difficult for the republicans to come through.  I feel that it was a missed opportunity.  It helped to utterly destroy unionist confidence in David Trimble and it meant that the institutions were not functioning for a long period of time which meant the opportunities to build mutual confidence in the institutions was damaged.<\/p><p> David Trimble, while politically not always an easy interlocutor, to put it mildly, showed extraordinary bravery as a leader.  He brought his party through a series of knife-edge votes in favour of staying in the institutions in the agreement.  I do not believe any other of the political leaders involved would have done so.  If Bertie Ahern had been winning votes in the D&aacute;il by one or two votes, would he have kept going?  Would Tony Blair have done so if the same was the case in the House of Commons?  I do not think so.  The republican movement was obviously and understandably focused on maintaining its own unity.  That was entirely understandable and minimising dissident activity was entirely right.  I acknowledge the approach taken by David Trimble.  When I think back on it, the politically savvy thing for him to have done would have been to break on the decommissioning issue on 10 April 1998 and not signed the agreement.<\/p><p>Who knows what would have happened then?  He did not do it, however.  His strategic insight was that it was better for unionism to engage.  However, with all that happened thereafter, he effectively signed his own political death warrant in doing that.  Things moved on.  Of course, decommissioning was resolved.  Mr. Ian Paisley, in the end, found it in himself to become the leader of the institutions.  Mr. Peter Robinson was very important in this.  The institutions have worked for most of the time from 2007, although not all the time.  Interestingly, Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson is the only person who was a leading figure in 1998 who is still active in front-line politics.  The consequences are real.  The Executive, Assembly and the North&ndash;South institutions in those early years never really had a chance to deliver results and provide an arena for the building of confidence and understanding.  As we have seen, unionism's uneasy accommodation of the agreement continues to have very negative and serious consequences.  While there are many causes of this, I do not believe it can be understood fully without an understanding of what happened.<\/p><p> Let me make a final point.  I do not want anything I say to be seen as detracting from the extraordinary, enormous and enduring importance of the agreement &mdash; absolutely not.  I feel incredibly proud to have taken part in it and, of all the things I did in my career, it is the one I am proudest of.  At times, however, I think the narrative of its creation can be a little simplistic.  It came out of a very complex, imperfect and ultimately very rushed negotiation.  Some elements were more developed than others.  With hindsight, I believe the weights placed on the various elements might have been different.  I do not think the agreement was ever intended to be the last word and it should not be seen as such.  It is for current and future generations of politicians and officials, civil society and, ultimately, citizens to decide if, when and how it might be revised or utterly superseded by a change in Northern Ireland's constitutional status, which it provides for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1191,"content":"<p>What has shined from Mr. Montgomery's evidence, and Mr. O'Connor's last week, is the total commitment to and sterling work on behalf of peace on this island.

It is sad that those who took the biggest risk, and their parties, were very damaged in the end by the political fallout.  That is something to reflect on too.  If future players have to make a new agreement, this must loom large in their minds.  The sensitivity and relationship needed, particularly between unionism and nationalism and the North and South, are becoming more important as we move towards what I believe will inevitably be a border poll, with all its associated trauma and problems.

My first question has been answered to a certain extent.  I was going to ask about the DUP being notable by its absence.  The question was answered to a point in that it was said it is possible that had the DUP been present, the agreement might not have been signed.  Was that a real possibility?  It is ironic now that the DUP, including Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson, who is now its leader and who actually walked out of the talks, as has been said, is now quoting the Good Friday Agreement, saying it is under such pressure from the protocol and outlining how his party would hate to see it being badly affected.  These are the people who did not participate or, indeed, sign up to the Good Friday Agreement.  Do the witnesses believe the agreement would not have been signed had the DUP remained?  It obviously walked out because republicans came back in.  Was that the greatest possibility at the time?<\/p> <p>  On an agreement on a border poll and referendum, the criterion of 50% plus 1% is, as far as I am aware, democracy.  It has been under a lot of pressure in various areas and from parties over the past while.  We have tried several times to get various Secretaries of State to outline the criteria they might use to initiate a border poll.  However, so far all parties, including the Labour Party with its shadow Under-Secretaries of State, etc., have refused to answer the question.  At the time of the agreement, it seemed that the 50% plus 1% criterion and the fact that a British Secretary of State would be the one to trigger a border poll were accepted generally.  I wonder was that the case.  Was there much disagreement?  Was there much argument about it?<\/p> <p>  The Chairman has mentioned parties who sacrificed so much and lost out.

We are now waiting for a First Minister of Sinn F&eacute;in to take part in the Assembly when it does get up and running.  Obviously, all parties took risks.

It was on whether there would have been an agreement had the DUP been involved.  In my opinion, there would have been absolutely no agreement.  It is hypothetical.  We did witness the approach to the talks of the DUP and the UK Unionist Party, which was linked to it, at an earlier stage.  As Mr. Montgomery mentioned, they left in September 1997 once Sinn F&eacute;in was back in.  Hypothetically, if I were to guess whether they would have blocked an agreement had they stayed on and were still there in Easter week, I would certainly say they would have.<\/p> <p>  It is an issue of what happened.  There is no doubt that the decommissioning issue weakened Mr. David Trimble.  Eventually, several years later, he had to pay the price for it.  In a way, what is more important is that the DUP found a way to reconcile itself to the new agreement, which clearly did command a significant level of support.  Mr. Montgomery's point about 71% is absolutely valid but there was no doubt that the agreement was then part of the landscape.  Several years later, the DUP was probably looking for a way of climbing on board rather than remaining in permanent opposition.  That would be my guess.<\/p><p>The way that they achieved that was through the St. Andrews Agreement of 2006, which, strictly speaking, was merely a tweaking of the Good Friday Agreement.  It clarified a few points but it gave the DUP enough face-saving cover to decide that things were now radically different from what had happened in 1998 and, therefore, it could come on board.  My gut feeling is that they would ultimately have found a way of coming on board even if it took several years but, in 1998, they would probably have walked many times before Easter week.  They would not still have been there by Easter week.  That was the reality.<\/p><p> On the point about Jeffrey Donaldson, it is true - I will not make a political comment - Jeffrey walked out on Good Friday itself.  He was obviously unhappy with what was being negotiated.  I suppose different people have different approaches to the agreement at different times.  Of course, he was still in the UUP at that stage.<\/p><p> Ultimately, the DUP did the right thing, in my view.  They found a way of narrowing the distance between themselves and the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>By the time the DUP came on board, the prisoner issue had effectively faded, decommissioning had been sorted out with the act of putting weapons beyond use by the IRA in 2005 and various other things had changed as well, not least that Mr. Paisley was now top dog, which, I think, was always one of his principal objectives.  It is also important, and not to be underestimated, that even though they were not numerically very significant, the presence of the two loyalist parties, the PUP and the UDP, which stayed in with the UUP when Sinn F&eacute;in came in and the DUP walked out, was quite important politically and symbolically, although, as I said, the other small unionist party walked out at the same time.<br\/><br\/>On the second question about the referendum, one can read in exhaustive detail in this article I wrote, which is published by <i>Irish Studies in International Affairs<\/i>, many of the origins of the different bits of the constitutional parts of the agreement, where they come from and how they were negotiated.  As I think I said, the funny thing is that the two governments had reached this broad consensus on the basic principles of self-determination and consent and the concept of British or Irish, or both, etc.  This was not challenged by any of the parties in particular.  The UUP's focus was very heavily on the changes to Articles 2 and 3, but one of the odd things is, as I said earlier, because of the way things were organised or not organised in the last week or so, and because there was a sense that the constitutional issues parts had been dealt with, no real scrutiny was given to the finer points, in particular, of the British legislation.  I know for a fact that a middle ranking official - my opposite number - drafted the legislation.  He expected it would be the subject of much discussion with his colleagues and with us and it basically went through on the nod.  For example, there had been provision for a referendum previously.  The 1973 Northern Ireland Constitution Act required a minimum ten year gap between referendums.  This was changed to seven, for example.  I am not entirely clear how or why.<br\/><br\/>On the 50% plus one criterion, to be very clear, I still remember vividly on the last night of the negotiations being asked by Sinn F&eacute;in representatives why was the language in the agreement simply a majority and did it actually mean 50% plus one, and I said that that is what a majority means.  If it is not qualified in any way, that is it.  At the time, I do not remember anybody in the negotiations challenging the idea or raising the question of 50% plus one being an adequate majority or not.  A majority is a majority.  On the whole question of what would be the politically wisest way to proceed, that is another debate.  The law is absolutely clear, including in the British legislation on this.<br\/><br\/>On the question of criteria, first of all, these things were not discussed in detail.  If one looks back at it, if we had tried to go into every detail we would never have finished.  It is interesting this question of criteria.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, said something to the same effect recently.  On the other hand, there was a comprehensive study by University College London - a group of eminent British and Irish academics looking at all of the technical issues around referendums.  Their view was in the end that it did not make sense to be too prescriptive about precisely what criteria should be met.  That was also the view taken by the High Court in Northern Ireland when a case was taken by a loyalist paramilitary victim's father.  It is a fine balance.<br\/><br\/>If you look back, it is almost 25 years since the agreement was reached.  Nobody at that time would have thought that these would become live questions any time soon and of course, they did not.  It was not necessary, maybe, to go into the kind of detail that ideally one might have wished people to go into.  The Chairman is correct that these questions are more pressing now and probably must be addressed in this new era.  That is kind of what I meant at the end when I stated that it is for present and future generations to build on and develop the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654124400,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>Deputy Brendan Smith took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Donoghue.

Both Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Donoghue are most welcome today.  This is a fascinating series for many of us.  Many of us feel that this is particularly important work given the background that they themselves have explained in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, and for us to discover how it came about because many of us would like to see this island united as a people and moving on, the economy moving on, education, jobs, etc., and the island working as one.  It is important that we learn lessons and understand what happened in the past to get to the point of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is why this work, and their testimony in that regard, is important.<\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Donoghue for the evidence they have given.  Some of it has raised a number of questions.  Maybe, at the outset, I will ask Mr. Montgomery about the statement he made in relation to David Trimble.  Even Mr. Tim O'Connor referenced last week the likes of David Trimble, and, by extension, John Hume and Seamus Mallon, who to a certain degree sacrificed themselves and possibly their political positions for the prize of peace, but in the statement Mr. Montgomery made, he referenced Bertie Ahern.  Could Mr. Montgomery clarify what he said about Bertie Ahern, who, at that stage, was tight for numbers?  With the arithmetic in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann then, Mr. Ahern only had cover of two.  He was dependent on Independents at the time, two of them Border representatives.  Could Mr. Montgomery clarify that point?<\/p> <p>  In finding out who was the real driver in the process, this probably relates to the two Governments.  Who was the real interested party here?  Who was pushing these negotiations?  Was the British Government really up for this?  Was it driving this or was it going along with it?  I would be interested in their thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  There would be much talk nowadays that some of the activity along the Border that probably should not be going on, such as fuel laundering, were issues that were part of the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Was that part of the talks that went on?  Was allowing some of these illegal activities that go on even today part of the agreement and if it was, can they give us more detail in relation to it?<\/p> <p>  Also, did letters for what were termed \"on-the-runs\" form part of negotiations, and will they give detail on that?<\/p><p>What would be the best approach to creating the best possible landing zone and space for constitutional change to happen?  There is lots of debate about calling a border poll.  We saw how hard it was to win the Good Friday Agreement and we see how difficult Brexit has been, as has dealing with the protocol.  What are the witnesses' views?  Some would be of the view that we should hold a citizens' assembly, call a border poll and get on with it.  What is their view on that?  In my view, it is far too simplistic in respect of the issues and all the parties involved, but I would like to know their opinions on it.<\/p><p> The question about members of political parties sacrificing their careers has been answered.

I will pick one or two, in no particular order.<\/p> <p>  The OTRs were not part of the negotiations.  It would have been extremely difficult politically for either Government to appear to be addressing the issue of those who had not even gone through the legal process.  It was sensitive enough trying to find early release arrangements for those who were already imprisoned.  There was speculation about side letters and so on but, as far as I am aware, they were not overtly part of the negotiations.  I do not think they were covertly part of the negotiations either.  I have never heard that.  It was simply too sensitive for either Government to go there.<\/p> <p>  On the illegal activities, if the question is were they part of the negotiations, the answer is, \"No, they were not\".  Of course, both Governments presumed that even after a ceasefire, some illegal activity of the kind the Senator mentioned would continue.  It was just an unwelcome fact of life that it would happen.  To give a direct answer, I am not aware of those having been on the agenda for negotiations and it is highly unlikely they would have been.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in was looking for clear assurances on prisoner releases.  That was by far the most important topic for it on Easter Week.  It can be understood why.  As Mr. Montgomery said, Sinn F&eacute;in wanted to preserve the unity of the movement so the bargaining was done between Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness on the one hand and Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair on the other.  It was very much at Head of Government level.  It came down to a two-year release point but they took quite a while to get to that.  That really was the main issue I am aware of from Sinn F&eacute;in's point of view.  As Mr. Montgomery said, it did not take a very close interest in the detail of the institutions.  It wanted to make sure that North-South structures would be acceptable but it was not particularly following the detail of that or, indeed, other areas.  Equality was a major issue for Sinn F&eacute;in, as was a serious commitment to policing reform, decommissioning in the sense of making sure it did not jeopardise the negotiations and the prisoner releases.  As I recall, that was Sinn F&eacute;in's agenda during that last week.<\/p> <p>  The question of who the real drivers were is a very good one.  It could not honestly be said who they were.  I would like to think that successive Irish Governments were driving the process.  Mr. Montgomery has described how, in effect, two positives came together.  I will repeat the point that, going back several years, unionists had wanted to get a replacement for the Anglo-Irish Agreement because they did not like the structure it set up.  The British Government of the day supported them in that, in a sense.  It wanted to reconcile unionists to what had been achieved, ideally by getting a new agreement.  The British Government in the early 1990s was actively helping, or looking for a way to get \"a new and more broadly based agreement\".  That was the phrase used.  We were content to go along with that, although we had in mind an agreement that would transcend the previous one.  We did not imagine a new agreement that would narrow the previous one.  We wanted it to be bigger and better.<\/p> <p>  It could be argued that the British pushed harder than us in the early 1990s to get a replacement for the Anglo-Irish Agreement but we were part of successive Irish Governments that were pushing the peace process harder.  We saw there was an opportunity - when I say \"we\" I mean at the political level.  In fairness to John Major, he led a tricky administration in London.  He would have liked to go further in some respects but was not able to do so because of his dependence on unionist votes.  He was responding to, let us say, Albert Reynolds's lead at the time.  I am trying to say that at different times one or other Government was perhaps slightly ahead of the other but, all told, it was the two Governments that really drove the final stages of the negotiations from about 1995 on.  At that point, it could not honestly be said there was anybody else.  It was the two Governments, two Taoisigh and the Irish Government, institutionally, that led.  We were certainly the ones who were most impatient to get rid of the decommissioning blockage.  We were trying to find ways of rebuilding the ceasefire.  In that sense, we were leading.  I have probably dealt with that point.  Mr. Montgomery will take over.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1214,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I do not know if it was his father or grandfather, but Mr. Neil T. Blaney was a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, chaired by Judge Catherine McGuinness, from 1994 to 1995.  I was in the secretariat at the time and I had the honour of meeting and talking to him then.  It is good to see the family continuity.<\/p> <p>  I do not underestimate Bertie Ahern's achievement for a second.  I know his majority in the D&aacute;il was tight.  I worked with him on this and I worked very closely with him on European matters later on.  He was an extraordinary negotiator.  The substance of my point is there was a broad consensus across political parties in the South, especially once the agreement had been reached with 94% in favour of it in a referendum.  There were no divisions in the same way there were no serious divisions within Northern nationalism about the agreement as a whole.  The unionists were the one group that was split 50-50.<\/p> <p>  On the question of fleeing responsibility, Mr. Tim O'Connor told me he was delighted with himself for using the term \"it takes a village\" last week because he felt it did take a village.  We could pick many people out.  The importance of John Hume cannot be underestimated, clearly.  He was the intellectual architect of the three-stranded approach and he was the person who took the biggest risks personally and politically in the opening up to republicanism, and the dialogue with Gerry Adams and so on.  We were also very lucky that the two Governments came into power within a month of each other.  Blair had a big majority and was not subject to the pressures others have been.  There were some excellent officials on both sides, including senior officials and people like Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; hUiginn, Mr. Dermot Gallagher and others on the British side, with an outstanding set of political leaders across the board.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about how best to approach things today.  That is a rather different question.  As I said, I am involved with this group set up by the Royal Irish Academy and the University of Notre Dame, which is engaging in commissioning lots of research on all sorts of different issues relevant, in some way, to the future of the island.  Some of it is directly about how Northern Ireland is constituted.  What is the Northern Ireland subvention?  How big is it?  How might it be retained or replaced?  There are also human rights questions and the question of the franchise to be used in a referendum.<\/p><p>There are other questions on issues such as co-operation in health, sport and so on.  There is a lot of work of that sort going on.  The Department of the Taoiseach is sponsoring a lot of that work through the shared island unit.  The Ireland's Future group, which is a civic nationalist group, is also very active.  There are lots of things happening.  On the question of whether it is the moment to bring the issue to the political level, that is a political decision.  My personal view is that for the moment at least, it is perhaps best for politicians, as politicians and as Members of the D&aacute;il or others, not to take the leading part.  It is clear that there is no basis on which the British Government or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could possibly be required to call a border poll within the next five years, given the Assembly election results.  Who knows if and when there would be such a majority?  We talked about criteria earlier.  My inclination is to feel that the work should continue.  On the question of whether there is an advantage in bringing people together in a citizens' assembly or otherwise, there might be.  My mind is open on that.  The great juggling act, at all times, is how to carry forward these discussions in a way that is not seen as threatening or damaging to the current environment.  For example, do we complicate getting a deal on Brexit if we take the discussions forward?  I just do not know the answer.  I will say that even the Royal Irish Academy body, which is essentially academic, has huge difficulties in getting unionists to take part in its research.  The same is true of other studies which have been undertaken.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1654124400,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1217,"content":"<p>I think Deputy Brendan Smith is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#J00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1218,"content":"<p>I will take the next Fianna F&aacute;il slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#J00400","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1219,"content":"<p>I call Senator Currie followed by Deputy Whitmore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#J00500","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending today.

I think the biggest single problem at the moment, if I am being frank about it, is the enormous lack of confidence and negativity within political unionism.  I do not really know how that should be dealt with.  It is interesting.  Reading the Slugger O'Toole website, one can see that lots of people from a unionist background are saying precisely that.  For all that David Trimble was difficult, he had a strategic idea about what he wanted to achieve, which I just do not see at present.  I see people acting tactically and not very cleverly tactically either.  That is the main problem.  It is not for me to say, but I think it is the single biggest thing that we lack.  There has always been a requirement for nationalism to try to be as genuinely understanding of unionism and as magnanimous as it can be, without diluting its principles.  That does not always come easily.  It cannot come easily for reasons that we understand.  On an entirely personal note, I was glad to see that the First Minister-elect, as it were, has written to the Queen, praising her role in Northern Ireland over the years.  That is an important gesture.  I hope all of us on the island of Ireland who are not unionists will be able to contribute to this union of hearts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>Just to add one or two extra dimensions to Mr. Montgomery's points, which I very much agree with, in the 1990s when we were limbering up for what became the Good Friday Agreement, remarkable personalities were involved, as Mr. Montgomery said.  However, they were not necessarily in agreement all the time.  They were strong personalities and frequently clashed.  I do not want to give the impression that somehow it was easier then.  A key ingredient was that there was a British Prime Minister at the time who was prepared to give a remarkable level of priority to the Northern Ireland issue.  He was helped by the fact that he had a huge majority.  He had the political pressure of his predecessor also having built up a head of steam on Northern Ireland.  There was also an IRA ceasefire.  The stars were aligned in such a way that it would have been difficult for Tony Blair to avoid giving it priority.  However, I do not think that we quite expected that he would put it right at the top of his list of priorities.  It was easier to imagine an Irish Taoiseach doing that.  Bertie Ahern needed to have somebody with the degree of commitment that Blair had.  That was quite unique.  It is very hard to imagine a British Prime Minister normally putting Northern Ireland at the top of their list of priorities.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether that can ever happen again, in effect.  I entirely agree with what Mr. Montgomery said about the current incumbent.  However, the truth is that even if there were a more promising incumbent, it would be difficult to imagine any British Government deciding that peace in Northern Ireland should get top priority.  It goes without saying that the issue would be prioritised by any Irish Taoiseach.  On the issue of officials, although they are career civil servants, in the 1990s the best and the brightest people wanted to work on the Northern Ireland peace process.  They came from other British Government Departments; they were not all in the Northern Ireland Office.  Some of them were in the Home Office or, dare I say it, the Ministry of Defence.  They came from a variety of backgrounds and they were talented.  One gets the impression that there is less commitment to the problems of Northern Ireland now.  It is true that Brexit has changed everything but it is hard to imagine reproducing that degree of political and official level commitment that we had 20 years ago.  It is a very good question.  It is one that troubles me a lot.  I wonder if it was really a fluke that we happened to have all the stars aligned, with Bill Clinton thrown in as well.  As I said in my opening remarks, he was a particularly useful resource because both unionists and nationalists felt reassured by him.  That is quite unusual for an American President.  As is well known, he played a key role in the last night of the talks.  It is hard to imagine a better constellation of circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I thank both witnesses for coming in.  Listening to them and reading their statements gives a sense, as Mr. Montgomery said in his piece, of a long, hard-won process that came to an end at breakneck speed.  We also get a sense from the way it was described that the purpose of the agreement was to try to end certain things - paramilitary and state violence - and bring about demilitarisation but the same level of thought was not given to what it was creating or moving towards, other than the strict constitutional or legal parameters around it.<\/p> <p>  It is also very interesting to hear from Mr. Montgomery about the different types of engagement.  We were talking last week about Jeffrey Donaldson having said that unionists were not engaged on the equality piece.  They were not against it; they just were not engaged.  Mr. Montgomery mentioned Sinn F&eacute;in not having had the same engagement on strand one as it did on other pieces.  That is very interesting to hear at this remove because it speaks to what was on the minds of people at the time.  I say that not in a critical way but simply to try to develop a better understanding.<\/p> <p>  One of the most interesting things is the space we are moving towards.  Ideally we are moving towards a peaceful but reconciled island or part of the island.  I wonder about the extent to which the witnesses, if they were to do it again, would look at the political structures.  Mr. Montgomery spoke about the designation of unionist and nationalist blocks being unhelpful in that way - I believe \"entrenching division\" was the phrase used - and about the d'Hondt system spreading everything.  One gets the sense 25 years on that not enough has happened on reconciliation, despite the agreement leading with that, although I respect what was said about symbolism and softer language other than the constitutional stuff.  If that is the case, does Mr. Montgomery believe the political structures have contributed to a move towards the edges rather than the entrenchment of the moderate centre?  While the Alliance Party did very well in the most recent election, if we take the period overall, there appears to have been a move away from the centre and towards the edges.  I wonder to what extent the political structures contributed to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#K00100","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I tend to think the entire philosophy of constitutional nationalism inspired by John Hume and articulated in the New Ireland Forum of the 1980s, and extending all the way through the 1990s, was that there were two traditions, two identities, on the island of Ireland and a way needed to be found to reconcile them.  Things were thought of very much in communal terms and that was a reflection of the reality.  When one looks at the percentage of votes that unionists, nationalists and republicans got at the time, it was well into the 90s.  This was effectively the political reality people were dealing with and the outcome was not, therefore, surprising.  Again, there was a great fear on the nationalist side in particular about going back towards majoritarianism in Stormont.  It was essential for nationalists to be able to demonstrate that they would be able to block any attempt by what was still a unionist majority to impose on them things that they did not want to have imposed.  The situation has since changed immensely for various reasons.  I do not know that the arrangements could have been much different at the time.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  There were always critics from the middle ground and civil society who pointed out that this meant that those who did not wish to designate as one or the other were put in a somewhat inferior position.  That is true.  Mark Durkan referred to the \"ugly scaffolding\" of the agreement, which was an excellent phrase.  For the reasons I outlined, the institutions did not get up and running properly in 1999 and 2000.  The focus of the unionists on decommissioning meant the spotlight was totally on the republicans on the other side and this helped to weaken the SDLP and also helped to weaken the unionists against the DUP.  When the DUP came in, it was on the basis that it was not really a partnership with Sinn F&eacute;in but about division of the spoils.  That was the DUP philosophy.  There is a provision in the agreement for a review but it was never used.  If there had been a few uninterrupted years and things had worked more normally and harmoniously, it may have been possible some time in the earlier 2000s to have a proper review and begin to look at these issues and maybe changes could have been made incrementally as we went along, within the overall framework.  That was not possible, however.  It did not happen and, to be frank, I find it hard to see it happening now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>I will supplement what Mr. Montgomery has said.  When we were negotiating the agreement - for the couple of years beforehand - we knew there would have to be special arrangements made on all sides to ensure that key decisions were supported by a majority of both traditions.  There was almost common ground on that.  The UUP never really challenged it.  The phrase used was \"sufficient consensus\".  There had to be some formula that would demonstrate that a decision was carried by both traditions.  Out of that came this idea that we would need the members of the Assembly to designate as one or the other.  At the time it was seen entirely as a positive thing.  Nobody was warning about what would happen if people were neither one or the other because the issue was not on the radar screen.  The \"other\" category was never likely to be significant back then.  In the meantime, it is now of greater interest because the \"other\" category is getting bigger and bigger.<\/p> <p>  I still feel we are a long way off, dare I say it, tinkering with the agreement.  I do not mean that in a pejorative sense.  We cannot really go back to reopen the agreement.  Review is the key point.  One could argue that, technically, the St. Andrews Agreement could have been seen as a review.  The truth is that there has been no formal declared review of the agreement since 1998.  That is as far as I think we should ever go.  If there was any talk about renegotiating or reopening the agreement, it would be fatal.  The issue that comes up most often is whether we still need to have this requirement for people to designate as nationalist or unionist.  I think we do.  Call me old-fashioned but I do not believe we have reached the point where we can dispense with that vital protection.  In five years' time, it might look different.  We have the Alliance Party trend but obviously a lot of things would have to happen.  I feel it is too early to imagine that we can do without that protection.  We need to demonstrate that every key decision is supported by both sides.

The St. Andrews Agreement already represented an important review or revision of the strand one institutions because it meant that the DUP or Ian Paisley, as its representative, was not obliged to present himself alongside Martin McGuinness for a single vote in the Assembly.

It is a bit like Brexit.  A majority of people here voted against leaving the EU and we are left with the decisions taken across the water.<\/p> <p>  I was reasonably young at the time of the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement and not involved in them.  I was Sinn F&eacute;in's representative in London so I was kind of watching from the sidelines at that point and not heavily involved in any of the bilateral or trilateral meetings.  I do remember very clearly, however, after the Good Friday Agreement was signed and delivered and all the rest of it, that there was a furious round of engagements within our party.  We had brought members of the African National Congress, ANC, over at our own expense.  We went on the road.  We had big meetings with hundreds of people; we had smaller meetings with two or three people around a kitchen table.  We went out and sold the agreement.  I remember Mitchel McLaughlin saying at an event in Toomebridge that people in the room needed to read the agreement and then read it again.  There was an acceptance and an acknowledgement that this was not a republican document and did not give us everything we wanted but was a template from which we could work.  I was at an event a couple of weeks ago in Monaghan at which Deputy Tully said the Good Friday Agreement did not answer the constitutional question but asked it.  I thought that was a very interesting way of putting it.<\/p> <p>  Since that time, we have seen some really important and fundamental aspects of the Good Friday Agreement not implemented, and that is what I would like the witnesses to focus their thoughts on.  We are still waiting for a bill of rights.  I have written to previous British Prime Ministers and have been told there is no demand for it.  All the issues we were very exercised about in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement we are still very concerned about.  We are where we are on an Irish language Act, and it has been painstaking to get something on the table in that regard.  There are issues around women's reproductive health, marriage equality and so on.  These are issues we have really struggled to bring forward in the 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement.  There are also, as I discussed with Tim O'Connor last week, the North-South bodies and the arrangements we have for co-operative work on the island of Ireland in a myriad of ways.  I know there was a draft list which was reduced significantly, and what we got was the bones of what was left, but we would have thought that those areas of work would have grown as well during the intervening years and we would have continued to build trust and relationships across the island of Ireland and to work in a very cohesive, pragmatic and constructive way to deliver for all the people on the island.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, Mr. Donoghue referred in his opening statement to validating Irish unity \"as a legitimate political objective\".  What are the witnesses' thoughts on how that has been?  The \"when\" of a referendum has almost become an \"if\", and it is important that that does not happen.  Irish unity is a legitimate political objective and we are entitled to continue to work towards it.  Others are entitled to work towards their political objectives as well.  There seems, however, to be a rowing back on that issue, and I would like the witnesses' thoughts on that too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1245,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gildernew.  I will take just a couple of those points.  That was a very interesting quotation from Deputy Tully about how the Good Friday Agreement had not answered the constitutional question but asked it.  I see it a little differently.  I see the Good Friday Agreement as having asked the question but then having agreed that we would answer it only in due course.  In other words, we almost parked it.  It was the first time all sides were agreeing as to what the constitutional issues were and, in effect, saying that, at a point to be defined later, we could come back to them.  In other words, the two documents I mentioned laid out the parameters as to how we would address constitutional questions.  It meant that all participants were able to go into the negotiations in a more relaxed frame of mind because each objective had been described as legitimate.  It meant it was easier to put things to one side and to focus on institutional questions.  I would like to think the questions were asked.  Answers were not required immediately but, as I said, it was agreed they would be answered in due course.<\/p> <p>  That brings us to the border poll Ms Gildernew talked about.  Again, curiously enough, not very much time was spent on that issue in the negotiations, as I recall.  It was always understood that the Irish Government would de facto be automatically consulted before the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would reach the determination.  It is not in the document partly to ease unionist concerns, but everybody knows that, in practice, it would be effectively a joint decision.  The Secretary of State will not pop this question in a vacuum.  I think that is widely understood.<\/p> <p>  As for Ms Gildernew's point about validating Irish unity, what I meant is that the British Government in the joint documents in the 1990s and the Good Friday Agreement itself accepted that it was legitimate for people to want Irish unity achieved by peaceful means.  The British Government accepted that and even said it would be encouragers, enablers and facilitators for agreement among the Irish people.  All of that was good.  It does not mean the British Government considers itself bound.  I am not speaking for the British Government but, clearly, the timing of a border poll is for the British Government to decide.  There was nothing in the agreement saying that it had to happen within a certain period of time.  In a sense, I am going along with much of what Ms Gildernew says.  To me, however, the question was deferred to, one, a point at which the Secretary of State technically pops the question, as it were, and, two, to a political context in which we all feel it would make sense to have a border poll.  That is my take on it, that we were pushing the question a little down the road, perhaps - not very far down the road but a few years down anyway - and that, in the meantime, initiatives such as what we see in the shared island work programme would be taken forward.  I think the shared island initiative is exactly what is required at the moment.<\/p> <p>  As for the draft list Ms Gildernew mentioned, she is absolutely right that there were various drafts of a whole series of policy areas.  Some of them would have involved implementation bodies with executive powers.  Some would have been more for harmonisation of effort.  Some would have been just for consultation.  There were different categories, but they certainly ran to several dozen policy areas under one or other category.  I would not say we were left with the bones of them, but they were whittled down and they had to be agreed.  A key point the Irish Government pushed was that these would be capable of dynamic growth.  Obviously, Sinn F&eacute;in was looking for that as well.  Personally, I am a little disappointed that it has not been possible to add to the initial list of bodies over the past 25 years, but I do recognise the political constraints that were against it.<\/p><p>I am not happy with them but I recognise there were pressures coming from the other direction.  We certainly worked hard to make it clear this would be an initial set of bodies and that it could be capable of additions over the years.  From those original lists, there are many areas that are still relevant for North-South co-operation and where we want to be doing more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1247,"content":"<p>I will make a few quick points on the constitutional issues and then on the North-South co-operation.  I do not believe it is altogether a fair summary to say the Good Friday Agreement had not answered the constitutional question but asked it.  It set out some very important principles, which remain valid, the first of which is the legitimacy of whatever choice is made by the majority in Northern Ireland.  Second is the recognition that it is for the people of Ireland alone to make the decision.  Third is a recognition that the present wish of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, freely exercised and legitimate, is to maintain the union and that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s status as part of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish.  That was, effectively, the Irish Government and others saying that, without getting into the history of partition or the history of the island, Northern Ireland is legitimately part of the UK on the basis of the principle of consent.  However, there is also a recognition that this could change in the ways we know and that both Governments would then be under a binding obligation to give effect to those decisions.  Fourth is the need for rigorous impartiality in the administration of Northern Ireland, irrespective of whatever the constitutional arrangements might be.  Fifth is the very important line, which I was involved in drafting, \"to recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose\", and that the right to hold citizenship would not be affected by future changes.  Those are very important principles.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the question of a referendum, it is both \"when\" and \"if\".  Ever since 1973, it has been open to the British Secretary of State to hold a referendum at any time.  They did so in 1973 as a bit of a stunt, quite frankly.  Now they are not obliged to hold a referendum unless they have a reason to believe a majority would favour a united Ireland. They are not obliged to, but they could do so if they wished to.  The whole question of whether there is a wish would have to be worked out.  I take Mr. Donoghue's point that the Irish Government and the British Government would have to take it into account, but as I said earlier, there was no look at how the different parts of the agreement were articulated constitutionally.  There is not even a reference in Articles 2 and 3, for example, to a referendum in the Republic.  One must assume it is implied, and I do not see how one could do it without it.  It does not actually say \"referendum\".  It is basically in Article 3 and it says, \"It is the firm will ... that a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island.\"  Could \"democratically expressed\" be a vote in the D&aacute;il?  Who is to say?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Donoghue spoke on North-South co-operation.  There have been long lists of possible areas of co-operation.  If one reads the Department of Foreign Affairs documents on Irish foreign policy, Se&aacute;n Lemass was beating the bushes in the mid-1960s to find things to talk about with Terence O'Neill.  This carried on through the Sunningdale Agreement, the Council of Ireland and on to this.  The Good Friday Agreement would not have been possible were it not for Bertie Ahern making a major concession to the unionists early in Easter week.  He scaled back considerably the level of ambition and certainly the volume.  He scaled back the size of it and he agreed it would have to be negotiated as a separate exercise, directly after the agreement.  I was involved in setting up the North-South institutions with Mr. Tim O'Connor as I was his right-hand man at that time.  Like Mr. Donoghue, I would agree it has been very disappointing how the institutions have not developed.  Some of the areas chosen were, to be honest, pretty trivial.  Others were more important.  I am not saying they have not done good work.  The North-South Ministerial Council has been, on and off, a place for political leaders and Ministers to get together.  Has it achieved what it should have achieved?  No, it has not.<\/p> <p>  On the other hand, North-South co-operation has continued in other ways as well.  Ironically, the most important single development in North-South co-operation of the past ten or 15 years has been the creation of the all-island single electricity market.  That owes nothing to the Good Friday Agreement.  It was agreed as a matter of common sense and for business.  Funnily enough, that is the irony of what the unionists have always said, that these things do happen if they make sense.  My own view is that one must have a reason to bring people together, and that there have not been such reasons is, I know, a frustration for many of my colleagues who have worked over the years on North-South co-operation.  The unionists, UUP and DUP have generally taken a pretty negative and minimalist approach to the operation of these bodies.  Equally, it is fair to say not everyone in the Republic, not every Department or public and State body in the Republic, is necessarily equally as enthusiastic about it as the political leadership might be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1248,"content":"<p>That might have been due to maybe having to share resources or a budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#M00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1249,"content":"<p>I remember vividly at the time of the negotiation of the bodies, which was the follow-up, in late 1998 or early 1999, that one of the big issues was the whole question of inward investment.

They are excellent contributions.  I apologise that I missed the very start of the meeting as I was delayed at an earlier meeting.<\/p> <p>  Both of the witnesses paid tribute, quite rightly, to Mr. Tony Blair.  We should always record his interest and his leadership at that time.  We would not be in the position we are today were it not for Tony Blair's major contribution.  I always think of the people with whom who I am sure the witnesses would have had great interactions over the years, such as the late Kevin McNamara, the Labour Party MP, and other people in all parties in Britain who were great champions of the needs of the Irish community in Northern Ireland.  That was at a time when it was not politically profitable for them in their own constituencies.  I recall some MPs and some Members of the House of Lords from Scotland, England and Wales being very interested in Ireland and unafraid to stand up in their respective Houses to make the case around the injustices they saw inflicted on the nationalist community over the years.<\/p> <p>  One theme that has come across, which also came from Mr. Tim O'Connor last week, is the strong partnership that is needed between both Governments to make progress at political and official level.  This comes through very clearly today.  Mr. Donoghue also mentioned the role of President Bill Clinton.  Some of the senior American people would tell us that President Clinton had been very much influenced by Senator Ted Kennedy and a group of people who worked closely alongside Senator Kennedy.  I remember listening to Senator Kennedy state that his family support for President Clinton prior to his first successful election was very much based on Mr. Clinton having to take an interest in Northern Ireland and be supportive of the efforts of the Irish National Caucus.  I recall Senator Kennedy saying this at a meeting I had the privilege of attending in Washington.  It is always important in recollections that we recall the roles of those people and the inspiration they gave.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Donoghue mentioned the unique capacity of Mr. George Mitchell.  Again, it was very important he was there in that particular role.<\/p><p>Mr. Montgomery mentioned how David Trimble was constantly facing Ulster Unionist council meetings.  We recall how very regularly on a Saturday morning that unionist council met.  The commentary on BBC and UTV would be about whether the delegates from Fermanagh and south Tyrone turn up in such numbers.  It was basically non-elected people within the unionist parties who were calling the shots that time.  Did Mr. Trimble and his colleagues in the leadership do enough to prepare the ground for change among their party membership?  It is obvious that other parties had prepared very well.  <br\/><br\/>I recall some of the loyalist parties stating that they did not have confidence in the main unionist parties and at times, they sought the help of the Irish Government at political official level to deal with some of the issues they saw as being of major importance to them.  <br\/><br\/>Last week, I mentioned that I remember when Bertie Ahern came to a group of us from the northern half of the country in the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, and we had probably around 80 Deputies and probably well over 20 Senators, and telling us that Articles 2 and 3 were going to be changed.  We did not expect that.  We had always outlined the value and importance of Articles 2 and 3 but at a meeting at 7 a.m. in Ballyconnell, he, along with Martin Mansergh and the then Attorney General, David Byrne, told quite a large number of us what the prize on offer was if we were willing to go along with what he was proposing.  The groundwork was prepared.  We were taken aback initially that this was being suggested but Bertie Ahern won the argument without any opposition in the party.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Montgomery mentioned that North-South structures dominated interaction but in one way, I am glad they did.  Colleagues on this committee will be tired of hearing me refer to it but the evolution and success of the all-Ireland economy happened without us talking about it because the right atmosphere was created through the new political structures and the new relationships North-South and east-west that emerged from the Good Friday Agreement.  We have seen significant development in the North-South all-Ireland economy.  Thankfully, constituencies like mine benefited significantly from that as did constituencies all over the country.  In reviewing the Good Friday Agreement, we often leave out some of the areas that are exceptionally successful that we take for granted.  We pocket them and move on to the next area of complaint.  We should always bear in mind what the success stories are.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Montgomery was pretty hard on himself with regard to how some ends could have been tied up better in terms of negotiations but I know that apart from his work and that of Mr. Donoghue at home in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement, they have had extensive experience at the most senior level internationally, particularly within the EU.  They know that if there is no deadline, people will negotiate forever so I do not think a deal where everything has been tied up happens that often.  Mr. Montgomery has been involved in EU treaties and different referenda.  It is very hard to tie everything up.  From that point of view, it is very understandable that some areas have been left very vague.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Montgomery also mentioned the studies by the University of London about the constitutional position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the provision in the Good Friday Agreement about the Secretary of State calling a referendum.

I think they came down on the side of saying that you could not be too prescriptive about it.  We could well understand that.  If we are talking about a border poll and I passionately want to see a united Ireland, we must do the groundwork.  If a border poll is called and the right spirit and partnership does not exist between both Governments, we will get the wrong outcome, which is the last thing we want to see.  We know what David Cameron did with his Brexit referendum.  He asked the question but did not get the answer he expected to get so, again, it was a case of lack of preparation.  If we do not have that spirit between both islands, North and South and east and west, we will be having it in the wrong atmosphere.  I sincerely hope we will be able to have a border poll and a successful one but I believe there is a lot of work to be done in the meantime.<\/p> <p>  People throw out this thing about a citizens' assembly.  The shared island dialogues are bringing in people interested in the environment, business and sport.  This is canvassing opinion far more extensively than choosing 99 people at random to negotiate and debate all issues.  There is considerable merit in the shared island dialogues in so many areas of everyday activity.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Montgomery mentioned the Royal Irish Academy.  I know the Department of the Taoiseach has commissioned the ESRI or the NESC.  The most extensive analysis of the education system North and South was completed recently.  I think it is all of those areas that we should bring together the necessary raw material.  That would pinpoint the issues we need to address.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Donoghue mentioned the potential of the agreement not being reached.  I agree with him 100%.  There are areas where there should have been much more North-South co-operation such as health and education.  Some of it is happening but not as part of a formal structure.  In the area of higher education, there is collaboration between all the colleges North and South.  Over the years, this State has probably put more financial resources into those joint projects between North and South than the Northern Ireland or British exchequer.  We need to continue to build that.  There have been good developments in health.  Again, this is an area where more work can be done.  Formal structures would drive greater and more intensive co-operation.  <\/p> <p>  IDA Ireland concerns and how it was protective of our image were mentioned.  I can understand that.  In a D&aacute;il debate, I suggested that Enterprise Ireland should be marketing Ireland in an all-Ireland context.  I got a fairly severe blast from the former First Minister Arlene Foster.  That put paid to that fairly quickly.  There are so many gains that could be achieved from implementing the agreement in full.  There are issues that have not been addressed but there are issues that have not been addressed that were devolved to Stormont along with issues that fall under the remit of both governments.  Implementing the agreement is critical.  <\/p> <p>  I was talking to some people in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Unfortunately, the British-Irish relationship is not good at the minute.  There are difficulties there.  Unfortunately, the British Government has announced that it is taking the unilateral approach to some things where structures are already in place to deal with legacy issues.  Legacy issues must be dealt with.  The British Government has come up with proposals that are deplorable.  You would associate them with some tinpot administration in central America rather than a parliamentary democracy in western Europe.  It is a serious bone of contention for families of victims and victims themselves and many of the very good advocacy groups that have worked on behalf of victims over the years.  Again, I thank Mr. Montgomery for his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#N00300","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>There are lots of people who could be named.  The Deputy mentioned Kevin McNamara but one name we should never forget is that of Mo Mowlam, who played a really important role not even so much in the negotiations themselves in the final stages but more in terms of developing relationships between the British Government and all strands of society in Northern Ireland so she certainly deserves to be remembered.<\/p><p>David Andrews and Liz O'Donnell are not to be forgotten either.  Of course, there was the previous generation of leaders as well, like Albert Reynolds.  John Bruton played his part, as did others.  That is the first thing.<\/p><p> The Deputy also mentioned Ted Kennedy.  That is a telling name because his brother, the president, did everything he could to avoid any engagement with the Irish issue at all - even when he came to Ireland in 1963.  He just did not want to do it.  The Irish ambassador to the US at the time wrote in a report that when he was talking to the president about the matter and mentioned the question of Irish unity, the president looked as if he had got another of his headaches.  Ted Kennedy was totally different.  Why was this?  It was partly because he came from Boston, though so of course did JFK.  It was John Hume above all who had the idea of reaching out to Irish America in a new way, bypassing the traditional structures of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and all the rest and speaking to the political mainstream.  Then there was fantastic work done by successive Irish embassies in Washington but above all by Se&aacute;n Donlon and Michael Lillis in the 1970s, and others.  That helps to explain that.<\/p><p> The third question was on whether the Ulster Unionists had prepared the ground.  The answer was they effectively had not.  They were hopelessly badly organised.  Mr. Donoghue knows this very well.  When they came into meetings and so on, I think Jonathan Powell once said it was if they were meeting each other for the first time very often and that they had never talked.  Sinn F&eacute;in was brilliantly well-organised and systematic both in the way it approached the negotiations but also, as I think Ms Gildernew was saying, in the way in which it consulted and informed people about what was going on, which was really important and significant.  The United Ulster Unionist Council was the particular way the party worked.  It was not elected but its members were the representatives of all the constituency associations.  In a strange way the Ulster Unionist Party was more democratic in its approach to its internal positions than anybody else.  It did not work very well.  They did not prepare the ground; not at all.  A lot of people within unionism would have found it hard enough to swallow power-sharing and North-South co-operation even if there had not been the whole question of republicans, prisoners, decommissioning and all the rest of it, so they did not prepare the ground.  On the other hand, if Trimble had been paying more attention to his grassroots would he have gone for it?  Maybe not.  Certainly his predecessor James Molyneaux avoided like the plague anything resembling a bold initiative.<\/p><p> I have a quick anecdote on Articles 2 and 3.  S&eacute;amus Mallon told the story of how some time just around the time of the agreement in a meeting in south Armagh, he read out the text of Articles 2 and 3.  He said we cannot be giving those up and we have to keep them.  Then he said, \"Well actually lads, these are the new Articles 2 and 3\".  When people read Articles 2 and 3 they knew.  They read fantastically well in my view and were a much more modern and open approach to the whole question, without sacrificing the ideal of unity.<\/p><p> On North-South relationships, the Deputy is absolutely right.  There is a natural impulse behind the all-island economy anyway.  It makes business sense.  A strange irony has been Brexit has probably done more to develop that economy than almost anything.  The question is whether the North-South institutions have done all they could to support this, build on it and channel it.  I do not think so.  Much of what is happening and has happened has been the result of individual businesses and initiatives seeing opportunities. <\/p><p> On the health question, the Deputy is absolutely right.  One of the very first studies we did in this Royal Irish Academy ARINS project was precisely about North-South health co-operation.  There were some very eminent academics such as Professor Deirdre Heenan and others.  Even in the area of statistics there are enormous gaps and black holes when it comes to being able to compare outcomes North and South and there are huge issues of co-operation.  I am on the board of Cancer Trials Ireland, which promotes all-Ireland cancer research.  Again, there are lots of efforts but the structures are not there to develop it as we should, so the Deputy is entirely correct on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1263,"content":"<p>I wish to come back to a couple of the points the Deputy made.  On the question about Trimble preparing his party for the difficult decisions that would be coming, which Mr. Montgomery has touched on, one demonstration of the fact he had not prepared the party was what happened on the last day.  Essentially, the way the week unfolded there was a heavy emphasis on Strand 2 and eventually the UUP got an agreement it was happy with there, and then Strand 1.  Everything seemed to be fine on the Thursday evening.  Trimble went off to a meeting of the United Ulster Unionist Council and came back in great form because it was happy with the way things were going.  Then on the Friday, suddenly there was a crisis relating to decommissioning and the possibility Sinn F&eacute;in might become ministers without there having been a start made to decommissioning.  Suddenly, we were in a big drama where Trimble almost has lost control of his party.  Jeffrey Donaldson was talking about walking out, and so on.  Clearly, more work should have been done within the UUP to prepare them for that very situation.  Everybody knew at that point what the language would be on decommissioning in the agreement, which was it did not require decommissioning at that stage.  A significant number of people in the UUP obviously were confronted for the first time on the Friday morning with this prospect.  They panicked and then Trimble had to deal with it.  The way he dealt with it was he got a side letter from Tony Blair, because there would have been no way the agreement itself would have been reopened to put in something to cover those unionist fears.  That was never going to happen.  I recall that as an example of where Trimble had not worked on his party in the way which, if I may say so, Bertie Ahern did with Fianna F&aacute;il.  Let me move to that point.  I remember well it was considered vital for the Government to get the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party onside around Articles 2 and 3 because, as the Deputy knows much better than me, clearly Fianna F&aacute;il had to accept this was a necessary price for everything else that would be coming.  Those meetings he was at were pivotal, really, in getting public support later during the referendum.  Without Fianna F&aacute;il at that time there would not have been the kind of commanding support that was needed.<\/p> <p>  In relation to a deadline, I touched on this earlier on.  It was just a combination of factors where Mitchell had set the deadline of Holy Thursday.  He threw in a bit of emotional blackmail, as it were, by saying he would be going home for the Easter weekend and he would not be coming back.  He said this publicly.  We assumed he would return eventually, if necessary, but, in effect, he was saying he was here until the end of the week, so take this deadline seriously.  I like to think we did and even though there was the last-minute crisis with the UUP we still managed it within Good Friday.  To echo the point, it concentrated minds.  Mr. Montgomery and myself in other negotiations - he in the EU and me at the UN - have seen how important it is to have a deadline.  It might be an illusory one or one easily broken but it gives people a sense they had to do something by a particular point in time.  When we actually reached midnight on Holy Thursday, it must be said nobody noticed it.  We were going through the whole night so nobody was out there with a watch saying we have missed our deadline but it was clear to everybody Friday was the absolute end of it and that is what it turned out to be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Donoghue"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>I was saying this is the way negotiations are and the higher the level, if you like, the greater the chaos and thicker the fog of war.  That is how it is.  My point is twofold.  First, I talk to a lot of academic researchers, students and so on.  A lot of the time you get the impression they think that somehow the agreement was engraved in tablets of stone and handed down from Mount Sinai.  The reality is it came about in the way we described, so there is a lot in it that was not particularly carefully thought through.  It was not a question of every word, syllable and comma being weighed but the overall.  To compare with EU treaties, there tends to be a very strong legal service and secretariat that are building up the text incrementally as you go along and bits are filled in as you finish and things are decided upon.<\/p><p>In this case, however, with the exception of the constitutional stuff, it was all almost thrown together in the past few days.  It was not a very orderly process.<\/p><p> A final point is that Trimble was not on his own.  He had some very important people with him, including Reg Empey and the McGimpsey brothers.  In the end, even John Taylor stuck with him across the line, as did Ken Maginnis.  It was far from a solo act.  His leadership was crucial, however.  He was elected leader after Jim Molyneaux in 1995.  The other three candidates were Taylor, Maginnis and William Ross.

Going back to comments made at the start of the meeting, my view is that it goes back to Tony Blair that morning on Downing Street when he stated, \"A new dawn has broken, has it not?\".  I have always wondered whether the British Government would have had any interest in trying to tackle Northern Ireland if it was not for the stonking majority Tony Blair had received and the zeal that a new Prime Minister experiences after such a political win.  Such a euphoric win brings with it a zeal and zest to try to do something new and put one's mark on history.  As noted in the Alastair Campbell diaries, in the first 18 to 24 months of the Blair Government, they wanted to make history on a range of things and they saw Northern Ireland as their opportunity to do that.  I always wondered what would have happened if there had been a different election result back in 1997.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the point, there has been a series of questions in respect of our guests' views on what the Good Friday Agreement is and what we think of it today but I would love to know hear their insight as people who were in the middle of the negotiations.

Roughly speaking, it related to the kind of role the assembly would have in defining the mandates for the North-South bodies and things like that.

I remember at lunchtime that day thinking it was all finished and it would take five years before we would be able to set up talks again, find somebody like George Mitchell to chair them and get everybody back in the right context.  Most of us were writing off the whole adventure at lunchtime on the Friday.  It is a matter of record that Trimble then got his side letter from Blair, decided he had enough to go ahead, rang George Mitchell and said he would sign, despite all the travails of his party.  Mitchell rang Bertie Ahern, the Taoiseach, to say that, while we may not believe it, he had just had David Trimble in the room and Trimble was ready to go.  The emotional rollercoaster was considerable, especially in the final couple of days.  I am trying to give members a flavour of it.  We all went into the room expecting there to be some catch but, with utter simplicity, each delegation leader simply said whether they were for the agreement or against the agreement.  Trimble simply said \"Yes\"; just one word.  Gerry Adams said something like, \"Yes, subject to ratification by the Ard Chomhairle\", but that was perfectly understandable.  We knew what that was about.  The fact is that they were all saying \"Yes\" and that was a great moment.

They presided over the formal sessions.  He was an incredibly articulate spokesman for the importance of agreement.  He could communicate superbly in simple, succinct and dignified language.  He had also, of course, been involved in drawing up the famous Mitchell principles of non-violence and so on.  All of that was very important.  However, the actual negotiation of the text was overwhelmingly between the two Governments and the various political parties in regard to individual aspects, such as prisoners in the case of Sinn F&eacute;in and North-South issues and so on in the case of the SDLP and the UUP.  That was kind of how it worked.  The role of Clinton was obviously very important.  Members may remember the famous visa for Gerry Adams back before the IRA ceasefire, at the end of August 1994.  That was significant and caused a rift with the British Government for a period, as well as between the British and Irish Governments.  The American involvement was hugely important but, at the same time, it was overwhelmingly an agreement that was home-grown between the British and Irish Governments, as well as politicians and others across the islands.<br\/><br\/>I have many memories of it.  An opinion poll was published in the <i>Belfast Telegraph<\/i>in early March.  Of those polled, 10% thought there would be an agreement, while 90% thought there would not.  In mid-March we started exchanging texts and language between the two Governments.  As I stated earlier, there was frantic work on North-South issues and that moved to London for three days the week before.  Bertie Ahern happened to be there with Tony Blair.  Britain had the EU Presidency at the time and Bertie Ahern was over there for that and they met but it was, above all, the group of officials.  I remember faxing things off to people - one faxed things in those days - from the Downing Street fax machine and thinking to myself that this was quite something.  I think it even had the Downing Street fax header and cover page on it.  That is the way it worked.  Another document was sent from a hotel in Cheltenham by a then senior civil servant who liked his racing, but that is another day's work.  That was a bit earlier.  There were many moments.<br\/><br\/>As Mr. Donoghue stated, when we reached agreement with the British in respect of North-South issues on the Saturday beforehand, that was good.  There was then a very strong unionist reaction.  The deal was that Bertie Ahern made his compromise on the Wednesday night.  The weird thing was that was not being very well communicated.  I remember that Paddy Teahon came in and instructed Tim O'Connor and me to write some new language on North-South issues.  Tim and I wrote up more or less what we assumed our position had been and was, and gave it to Teahon, who said it was not what he wanted at all.  It was only at the third go that he told us about the changes to which Bertie Ahern had agreed, which then made it possible for us to know what it was he wanted.  That is the kind of way things can work.<\/p><p>On the final day, as Mr. Donoghue said, there was a mixture of total exhaustion and adrenaline.  He might remember that some of us had been staying in the Stormont Hotel and there was a loyalist threat so we all had to be moved into a bunker and sleep on the floor.  On the final day or two we were just sleeping on chairs and so on.  There was a great exhilaration because it was a beautiful bright morning.  I remember going for a walk around the castle buildings and the Stormont estate.  It had been a really cold and frosty morning, with snow overnight.  The loyalists had been throwing snowballs at the DUP, whose members were protesting outside the walls.  I was with my friend, Mr. David Cooney, later Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and another of my bosses, and we agreed that no matter what happened to us in the rest of our careers, nothing would ever equal it.  He went on to be a Secretary General and I went on to be the permanent representative to the European Union and so on.<\/p><p> There was a premature celebration.  Despite the fact it was Good Friday, somebody had laid hands on a few bottles of champagne so this was drunk with great excitement at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.  We then heard the deal was not finished after all.  There was exhaustion, incipient hangover and general despair; it was a terrible moment.  As Mr. Donoghue has said, the word then went through.  I will never forget because Mr. Mitchell convened the meeting and all the leaders sat around the table.  Everybody in the building, more or less, forced their way into the back of the room.  There were guys in chef's whites who fought their way through to stand in the back of the room.  Everyone was there and there was a tremendous sense of a democratic moment.<\/p><p> We also had the final irony with the press conferences because there had to be a formal British-Irish agreement.  As the committee knows, the agreement was in two parts, with a formal British-Irish agreement and the text of a multiparty agreement as an annexe.  The text had to be signed and Prime Minister Tony Blair was in a mad hurry to get off the stage for his Easter holidays.  His wife and kids were already there on some fine estate loaned to them by the then Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Jos&eacute; Aznar.  He had to be dragged back in to sign this text.  I had been organising this with my British opposite number.  The nearest room was one with no flags or anything.  There were dirty coffee cups on the edge.  We sat them down and only one photographer, who was from Reuters, could be found.  That is why there is only one photograph of the two of them signing the thing.  I arranged that a member of our delegation, the co-ordinator, would be there to give the pen to sign the document but she could not be found so I had to do it.  They went sprinting out of the room.  Mr. Blair went out and got his helicopter.  Off he went for his Easter holiday.  It was extraordinary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022060200002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Montgomery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1275,"content":"<p>That is excellent.

For the Downing Street Declaration of December 1993, there had been much consideration of the key drivers of conflict and what caused the conflict, as well as how to address those factors in a statement by the two Governments.  The background had comprised contact between John Hume and Gerry Adams, initially, and then there were other contacts involving Dr. Martin Mansergh and others.  In that process there would have been a dialogue about the causes of the conflict.  That got translated into the negotiation of the Downing Street Declaration during 1993.  In the same way, those contents would have continued into 1995 and the framework document.<\/p> <p>  I could not honestly say that in the week leading up to Good Friday, there was lengthy analysis of the factors behind the conflict.

It was being put together piecemeal, as Mr. Montgomery states.  There was a chunk of text here on victims of violence, another chunk on reconciliation and another chunk on prisoners.  It was being put together at high speed.  I would be surprised if there was any opportunity to have a fuller debate on the causes of conflict.

The right of the Irish people as a whole to self-determination, which was a key republican demand, was balanced by the need for consent.  Within that there was a key unionist requirement of acceptance of the legitimacy of Northern Ireland as part of the UK, on the basis of consent, without going back to what happened in 1920 or thereafter.  However, it also recognised that a substantial section of the people in Northern Ireland share the legitimate wish of the majority of the people of the island of Ireland for a united Ireland.  The text was balanced.  It implicitly nodded at these things but when it came to violence in particular, it stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of suffering.

I saw the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, give a contribution in the Seanad yesterday.  When I saw that contribution I nearly did not believe it and a combination of emotions came forward, including upset, anger, frustration and annoyance.  Those are the most parliamentary and suitable words I can use.  I was thinking of all the families that have been waiting on legislation to recognise their children who have been born through surrogacy and how they must have felt about the situation if that was how I felt.<\/p> <p>  His comments were appalling and shocking and we need to know exactly what our role and remit is in this committee.  We all came onto this committee wanting to genuinely make a difference and regardless of members' views on surrogacy, everybody on this committee wants to see that the children who have been born already and whom we all know and love in our communities would at least have the retrospection and recognition handled and dealt with.  Families have been given hope and I know as a Deputy that any parliamentary question I tabled and had answered always pointed to the fact that this committee would be set up and then I was delighted to be able to be part of the committee.  I would like the Minister to come into our committee meeting on 9 June and to clarify exactly what his position and the position of the Department of Health is on this committee.  I would like a guarantee and assurance before we draft our report that our recommendations will be taken on board, that this is not a talking shop and a tick-the-box exercise and that what we recommend will be included in the assisted human reproduction, AHR, Bill.  That is vital and the Minister also needs to acknowledge the hurt and upset he has caused for many families.<\/p> <p>  I am sick of people trying to say the creation of this committee is somehow delaying the AHR Bill, which has been at pre-legislative stage since 2017, five years ago.  This committee, which is working extremely well and effectively, is not delaying the AHR Bill in any way, shape or form.  I would like the Minister to clarify that and he needs to do so in our public session next week.  I reiterate that my experience on the committee is that we are all committed to ensuring that legislation is drafted to recognise those families and children.  It is long overdue and I nearly could not believe what I witnessed yesterday.  I was not physically there but when I saw it I was shocked and appalled.  It was unbelievably disingenuous and disrespectful.  We are colleagues in this Oireachtas and he has undermined our position.  I would like all of that to be clarified.

I was in the Seanad yesterday for statements on women's health and the women's health action plan.  A number of Senators referenced our committee, the AHR Bill and the need for that Bill to include international surrogacy and a retrospective provision for children already born via surrogacy.  The Minister began his reply by stating that international surrogacy was never intended to be in the AHR Bill and that the Bill would be law by now if it were not for international surrogacy.  He said this committee was going well and then proceeded to state that it would bring forward amendments.  He then proceeded to state that AHR is urgent and that international surrogacy could be brought in by amending legislation.  This caused untold hurt and upset among families with children via surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  Children who are in urgent need of the protections of a full legal relationship with their parents are not an inconvenience.<\/p><p>Women who have had health difficulties and who have had to avail of surrogacy to grow their families, and did so lawfully in other jurisdictions, are not an inconvenience.  Women in need of health supports are not an inconvenience.  The same-sex couples who require legislative support to grow their families are not an inconvenience.  Yesterday was the beginning of Pride month, so happy Pride, by the way, to all of the people who were devastated and upset by his remarks.<\/p><p> All of these people are citizens of this country and they all have a reasonable expectation that the State will support their legitimate needs.  The pausing of the AHR Bill on Committee Stage at the Joint Committee on Health gave rise to the reasonable expectation that the work and the recommendations of this committee would be brought forward for inclusion on Committee Stage as amendments.  This committee is not charged with writing the legislation.  None of us are legislative drafters.  We are charged with making recommendations on the specific terms of reference.<\/p><p> The Minister states that he only agreed to a pause of the AHR Bill of 12 weeks.  That would have been an impossible deadline to meet, which makes we wonder about his true commitment to the outcome of this committee.  I cannot understand why there is a certain urgency and where that has come from.  After all, if it is an urgency driven by the very real need to fund IVF, we have had witnesses before the committee who advised us that the two are not interdependent.  There is already tax relief on medical expenses and that could be enhanced, so there are ways of ensuring this funding for IVF.  The Minister appears to be operating under the misunderstanding that he cannot argue for a budget provision for IVF funding and deliver that for families unless and until the AHR Bill is passed.  Perhaps if he informed himself of the actual workings of this committee and the witnesses to it, who include many completely objective witnesses, such as the Ombudsman for Children, rather than making wild, ill-informed statements, as he did yesterday, he might have seen there is a solution to his ribbon-cutting ambition.  He might also have informed himself of the fact there are considerable flaws in the AHR Bill as it stands that need to be addressed.  To have an ambition to bring the Bill into law by the summer recess, even without international surrogacy, is considerably na&iuml;ve.<\/p><p> I am sure this is a solo run by the Minister.  I have seen the incredible work by the members of this committee and it is my privilege to serve with them.  In particular, I would point to my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, Senator Erin McGreehan and Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor, who have been exceptional and who have sat with families and heard their lived experience and hardship, and have been really moved.  They have been fantastic advocates.  I am confident the Minister&rsquo;s statement is not in the agreement with their thinking.  I am also confident it is not in agreement with the Taoiseach's thinking, given he was the first to launch the assisted human reproduction review and prospective legislation in 2005.  I am fairly sure he does not support the Minister's perspective.  I am absolutely confident my own party colleagues at Cabinet do not support this kicking the can down the road attitude.  I support Deputy Funchion&rsquo;s call to have the Minister come before the committee.  I would support the committee, if it was deemed appropriate, issuing a press statement questioning the statement of the Minister on the record of the Seanad yesterday.  Clarification is needed as it would appear he is departing from agreed Government policy without recourse to his Government and Cabinet colleagues, and he is also being disrespectful of and undermining the work of this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#A00500","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1299,"content":"<p>I listened to what the Minister said yesterday in the Seanad.  I was very disappointed to hear the language he used and that he would appear at this late stage to be moving the goalposts.  The committee was never tasked with presenting legislation.  That is not our job; it is the job of the Minister and the Government to do that.  When we look back to our remit, the joint committee was to consider and make recommendations on measures.  That is our role and we cannot go outside that role.  I ask the Minister to take a look at the remit of the committee so he fully understands what our role is.<\/p> <p>  It is also disappointing because, at the very start of this committee, we had concerns about what our role was and how it would be incorporated into the workings of Government.  We attempted at every stage to get clarity on that matter.  We first wrote to the Minister on 25 March, although we did not receive a response.  We also wrote on 14 April, asking that he clarify the role of the committee and how he would consider any report published by the committee in the consideration of the Bill, but it was four or five weeks before we received a response.  As we all know, this committee is a 12-week committee so we have a very tight deadline.  It is very challenging but we have stepped up to the challenge and we have put in as much time as possible to get this done thoroughly.  It is disappointing that, despite limited engagement from the Minister, he would then stand up and misrepresent the functions of this committee in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  This committee was never to present legislation for consideration.  I am conscious of the work that every member of the committee has done.  It is unfortunate that this would now appear to undermine the level of input and the level of effort, not only of the committee members, but also the witnesses who have come in to tell us their often very personal stories.  For those people to now feel their input will potentially not be considered is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the suggestion to invite the Minister in.  I see Senator Ruane is now with us and she may want to comment.  The proposal is that we invite the Minister in next week, or potentially the week after, to seek clarity on this.  We are due to finish and present our report on 7 July and the D&aacute;il will be rising within a week at that point.  There is an entire summer recess period where the Minister and his Department could take our recommendations, draft them and turn them into legislation that can be utilised.  There is no way what we are doing is delaying the AHR Bill.  The fact that is being indicated is incorrect and wrong.<\/p> <p>  We will leave it at that that because we have witnesses before the committee.  Is it agreed that we invite in the Minister?  Agreed.  Hopefully, we will finally get some clarity on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to our witnesses for the delay.  In our meeting today, we will consider how to best prevent the exploitation or coercion of surrogates and intending parents, and ensure intending parents have an understanding of the full implications of the surrogacy process.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome to the committee room Ms  Edwina Oakes, Ms Marian O&rsquo;Tuama and Ms Victoria Reid from the Irish Fertility Counsellors Association.  Joining us online are Ms Sara Cohen and Ms Sharon O'Shea.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will deal with the issue of privilege and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  There are limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their own domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence that they give.  <\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams that prior to making a contribution to the meeting they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  I invite the witnesses to make their opening statements and we will then go to questions.  I first call Ms Cohen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#B00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>I wish committee members a good morning from Toronto, Canada.  My name is Sara Cohen and my practice is Fertility Law Canada.  For the past 12 years, I have practised exclusively in the area of fertility law and I am recognised as one of the leading fertility lawyers in Canada.  I have provided independent legal advice to more than 2,000 participants of gestational surrogacy in Canada, to both Canadian international intended parents as well as to Canadian surrogates.  I am grateful and honoured to be invited to share my experience with the committee.<\/p> <p>  The committee asked me to discuss how to best prevent the exploitation or coercion of gestational surrogates.  During this opening statement, I will focus on my personal experience.  However, in my briefing document, I provided several academic articles and other resources to help members.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the reason I am most proud of my role in gestational surrogacy in Canada is my belief that the process is ethical and protects the well-being of all parties involved, as well as those of the resulting child.  I imagine that we all agree that surrogacy cannot be ethical where surrogates are exploited or coerced to participate.  This is antithetical to my experience of surrogacy in Canada.  In fact, I find the opposite to be true.  Almost without exception, surrogates tend to find the experience rewarding and empowering.  They frequently have long relationships with intended parents and the resulting child long after the birth.  Many gestational surrogates have such positive experiences that they choose to participate in subsequent journeys.<\/p> <p>  Surrogacy in Canada is recognised and regulated both federally, in the Assisted Human Reproduction Act, and provincially.  Surrogacy in Canada is altruistic and commercialised surrogacy is prohibited by federal law.  However, the Canadian concept of altruism allows surrogates to be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses, where such expense is incurred as a result of the surrogacy.  Each province handles legal parentage of a child born through surrogacy a little bit differently and, with the exception of the province of Quebec, all are surrogacy-friendly.  However, in all provinces, the surrogate must provide her consent not to be a parent of the child not only before transfer of the embryo to her body but again following the child's birth.<\/p> <p>  Part of the reason I believe surrogacy in Canada is not coercive or exploitative is simply because of the socioeconomic realities of Canadian women, which are dissimilar to those of women in Kenya, Mexico or other such surrogacy destinations, but far more similar to American and British women.  Canadian women have agency over their bodies, access to social services and free healthcare.  In my experience and as the research bears out, surrogates in Canada tend to be Caucasian, educated, financially secure, have emotional and other support available to them and are English-speaking.  Often, I find them to be employed in helping professions, such as nurses, midwives, teachers or early childhood educators.  They do not need to do this but they want to do this.<\/p> <p>  Canadian gestational surrogates are required to undergo psychological counselling, obtain independent legal advice, undergo medical screening and enter into a written legal agreement with the intended parents - all prior to the transfer of an embryo to her body.  They retain decision-making rights over their bodies throughout the process.  I find that the surrogates are very well informed about surrogacy, including the medical, legal and psychological procedures, risks and expectations, prior to an embryo transfer.  Perhaps it is for these reasons that there are no cases in Canada where a surrogate has ever tried to keep the baby.<\/p> <p>  Surrogacy in Canada is about relationships.  In practice, it is the surrogate who chooses the intended parents for whom-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Cohen"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1301,"content":"<p>Ms Cohen has gone on mute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#C00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1302,"content":"<p>I noticed that and I apologise.  I will back up one sentence.  It is the surrogate who chooses the intended parents for whom she will carry, and not the other way around.  The women are not coerced or exploited and they do this because they want to.  They tend to desire and experience meaningful, collaborative and caring relationships with the intended parents throughout the pregnancy and long after the birth.<\/p> <p>  I understand from my Irish colleagues that it is unlikely that the need for gestational surrogates will be met by domestic surrogacy.  Canada continues to provide Irish intended parents with a safe, ethical and legal jurisdiction in which to engage in gestational surrogacy.  Working collaboratively, Canadian and Irish lawyers are and ought to be engaged to ensure that the legalities of both jurisdictions are met.  I hope that the checks and balances to ensure free and informed consent of the gestational surrogates, the federal and provincial recognition and regulation of surrogacy in Canada, the positive experiences of the gestational surrogates and the socioeconomic realities of Canadian women satisfies the committee that surrogacy in Canada is neither coercive nor exploitative of gestational surrogates, but is in fact empowering and rewarding.  I believe that this committee, Irish intended parents, lawmakers and courts can find comfort and confidence in Canadian surrogacy to provide a safe and ethical surrogate system for Irish intended parents engaging in surrogacy abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Cohen"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>I call Ms O'Shea to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#C00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to tell our family story.  I carried my sister's baby out of an act of love eight years ago.  My sister Marie was very sick as a child, spent much time in hospital and battled illness.  In her teen years, she was told by doctors and the medical profession that her womb never develop properly to carry a child.  Therefore, automatically, as a family, we spoke about this around our table and I told Marie that I would carry a baby for her by IVF if I was able to have children and if the timing was right.  From that day, in my head that was the way it was going to be in our house.  I was never forced, asked or pushed into doing anything.  It was an automatic gesture of love for my sister, who fought hard to survive from an illness that she had from birth.<\/p> <p>  The years went by and luckily I married and went on to have two beautiful children of my own.  Marie and John, in turn, married, and the time came when we spoke about them having a family, with me being her surrogate.  Hopefully, it would work.  Marie and John had a lot of work to do and plans to sort.  There were many clinics, a lot of travelling, medication and injections for both of us.  Our journey had started.  It was definitely not an easy route for them.  Marie and John created their own embryos which were transferred to me.  To our delight, a positive pregnancy test meant that Marie and John were expecting their little baby.  We had a positive test. <\/p> <p>  One day while I was carrying Marie's baby, a lady came to me and asked how I would ever give away my child.  She did not understand, so I explained to her as I did to my own children at that time.  When I asked them, in a way, if we would we help Marie and John have a family of their own, of course being kids, they said yes.  We kept it simple for them.  I told them that I was giving Marie and John somewhere safe for their baby to grow, because Marie could not do this herself.  They understood this.  <\/p> <p>  I can never imagine how hard it was for Marie to watch me carry her little baby.  People said to me while I was carrying Lucy that I must have a very special bond with this baby, to which I would reply that it was Marie with whom I had the special bond.  I was just babysitting for nine months, like any auntie would do.  Thank God, Marie and John had a beautiful little girl eight years ago.  All was well.  We had Lucy by caesarian section.  She was taken away with Marie and John and I met her back on the ward in her mammy's arms for the first time as a proud aunt.<\/p> <p>  We were discharged from the hospital and when the day came, we had to register Lucy's birth.  I will never forget that day.  I felt like a criminal, signing my name on a birth certificate with Marie's husband John.  No questions were asked of him but this is what we had to do.  We hugged and we cried, and it broke my heart.  It was bittersweet.  Marie now had her family but was not seen as mammy in the eyes of the law.  Now, due to the lack of law, my own children have a sister on a birth certificate, which my family and I have no genetic link too.  She is Marie's and John's daughter.  <\/p> <p>  This time I was diagnosed with cancer.  It gave me much time to think, and one of the things I thought about was Marie's story.<\/p><p>It was a special story.  She was a fighter, but now I feel that I have to try to fight to ensure that Marie gets the legal rights that she and Lucy deserve.  This is why I am here today.  I thank the committee members for taking the time to hear our story, even though this was a brief description.  I could speak all day about our family's story because there were so many ups and downs and ins and outs.  We are here today, though, as one of the many families looking for the legal rights that Marie and Lucy deserve, and for me, as the surrogate, to not have any legal rights to Lucy.  It is Marie who deserves these rights and not me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Sharon O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1306,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Shea for her contribution and for telling us her personal story.

I was a surrogate for my sister, Emma, eight years ago.  I will tell the committee members a little bit about Emma&rsquo;s journey.  I do not have any childhood memories of Emma in which she was without a doll in her hand or was not wheeling a pram.  From the time she could walk and talk, Emma would say she wanted to be a mammy and that one day she would have a little girl called Sophie and a little boy called Sean.  This was her dream.  Fast forward some years later when Emma was 17 years old and she was given some devastating news.  It was discovered that she had a medical condition that meant she would be unable to carry her own children.  Although her ovaries were working fine and she would be able to have her own biological children, she would need someone who could give her babies a safe place to grow.<\/p> <p>  My mother told me that Emma&rsquo;s heart broke into a million pieces that day.  My immediate response was that I would be willing and waiting to help Emma in her journey to motherhood whenever she felt the time was right.  For me, it was more than just about giving her baby a safe place to grow; it was also about helping to mend her broken heart.  In 2013, we began that process using Emma's embryos and her husband's sperm.  A year later, a little baby girl called Sophie was born into mammy&rsquo;s arms.  Right in front of me, all the pieces of my sister&rsquo;s broken heart were put back together again.  My sister was finally a mammy.  What an honour it was for me to be a part of something so special.<\/p> <p>  With the help of our sisters, Laura and Jessica, and our best friend, Leigh, Emma and her husband, Michael, spent the next seven years trying to give Sophie a sibling.  After five attempts, three miscarriages and the devastating loss of their daughter, Katie, they almost gave up.  I do not know how or where Emma found the strength, but somehow she found the fight in her to try what would be her last attempt at giving Sophie an earth brother or sister.  With the help of our sister, Laura, this time last year, I am delighted to say that a little boy called Sean finally made his appearance into the world, and he brought a friend with him, his twin brother Harry.  Both babies were born into their mammy's arms, just like their sisters were.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult to fit into the time available today a full description of just how hard the past eight years have been for my sister, but I hope I have given the committee members some kind of insight into the hardship she has had to endure.  It has been mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting.  It has been a fight from the very beginning.  The day Emma held her little boys in her arms was the day her fight should have been over.  Sadly, though, due to the laws here, her fight continues because her children do not have the same rights as mine or yours.  Emma does not have the same rights as a mother as I do.  In fact, I have more legal rights to her daughter than she does herself.<\/p> <p>  My experience of acting as a surrogate was an amazing one, but - like Ms O'Shea - one of the most difficult things I have ever had to do was walk into a registry office with my sister&rsquo;s husband and register her baby as my own.  This was the only option we had because of these outdated laws.  These laws need to catch up with science.  These laws are unfair to the surrogate and to the mother.  I do not think there is a person in this room today who could look my sister in the eye and tell her she is not a mammy, but these laws tell her just that.  These laws deprive Emma of a title she so rightly deserves.  She has four beautiful biological children.  Emma is Sophie's, Katie's, Sean's and Harry's mammy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Victoria Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1308,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Reid.

I thank the committee for the invitation to share our perspectives with the members.  The IFCA was founded in 2008 by a group of specialist fertility counsellors in response to emerging issues clients were experiencing while preparing for investigations and treatment.  Since then, we have grown our membership to 25 professionally qualified counsellors, psychotherapists and psychologists with specialist training in fertility.  We believe the work we do holds significant value for clients thinking about embarking on their fertility journey.   We believe that all patients making reproductive choices deserve the opportunity to speak to a qualified and experienced mental health professional who can guide them through the implications of their decisions and support them as they make those decisions.  Our role as specialist fertility counsellors is to listen and support clients in a non-judgmental way.<\/p> <p>  There can be complex considerations around assisted reproduction, which can be very challenging for the clients.  We believe that the provision of a structured counselling service in surrogacy cases serves to guard against the exploitation of the intending parents and is also in the best interests of the resulting child.  As specialist fertility counsellors, we are trained to create a confidential and safe space for clients to talk through their feelings, concerns, losses and hopes and to explore the future implications for them and for their families.  The IFCA wishes to highlight the importance of implications counselling for intending parents and surrogates.  Implications counselling for intending parents is in line with best international practice.  It allows the intending parties an opportunity to carefully consider all the possible implications of their decisions and how those may impact them in future.  Implications counselling includes social, legal and ethical considerations to be contemplated when creating a family and it also allows the opportunity for intending individuals to voice any concerns or fears they may have.  Specialist fertility implications counselling would assist in preventing the exploitation and coercion of intending parents and ensure an understanding of the full implications of the surrogacy process.<\/p> <p>  As specialist fertility counsellors are in the room with the intended parties, we are uniquely positioned to facilitate addressing any areas of concern our clients may have relating to creating a human being.  Some clinical research has been conducted by an IFCA member, Dr. Ciara Byrne, clinical psychologist, in conjunction with the National Infertility Support and Information Group, NISIG.  Dr. Byrne conducted research on the socio-emotional experience of these parents.  Her research findings indicated that there is a strong clinical need for psychological support among Irish parents of children born through surrogacy.  The key findings that emerged are that: parents had concerns that their child would reject them; parents had significant concerns regarding disapproval from the community; and parents also felt they lacked the practical and emotional tools for communicating with their child about their origin story.  Equipping parents with the tools for healthy family dialogue around their origin story is key to promoting positive mental health amongst children.  <\/p> <p>  Professor Golombok and her colleagues at the University of Cambridge have spent four decades examining the impact on the child and on the family of psychological adjustment to alternative family forms, including those families created through donor conception and surrogacy.  They have found that those families who disclosed donor and surrogate origins to children in the preschool years generally showed more positive emotional outcomes when the children reached middle childhood than children from non-disclosing families.  In contrast, the evidence for surrogate or donor offspring told of their origins as adolescents or adults indicates negative emotional reactions such as shock, betrayal and confusion.  When parents choose not to disclose origins through surrogacy or donor conception to their children, it is most often due to their own feelings of fear and the perceived lack of tools on how to communicate with their children.<\/p> <p>  The IFCA is firmly committed to supporting all parties in surrogacy treatments to ensure that the process is normalised, humane and fair to all.<\/p><p>High-quality specialist fertility counselling is one way to ensure that the risks of exploitation or coercion to intending parents is minimised.  We are happy to engage further with the committee in any way it sees fit and to answer any questions committee members may have, either today or at a future date.<\/p><p> I offer my sincere thanks to the committee for the opportunity to address it on this important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Edwina Oakes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1311,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Oakes.

I do not have experience of surrogacy in places such as Kenya so it would be unfair of me to comment on that.  I can tell the Senator only that it is very successful in Canada.  The proof is in the pudding in that all the academic research, in my personal experience with surrogacy, shows that it is incredibly rewarding and truly something the parties are proud of.<\/p> <p>  As to where I think Canada could improve, there are a few areas.  We have agencies in Canada in respect of which, similar to most jurisdictions in the United States, I would love to see some regulation, with certain professional backgrounds required.  Overall, we see counsellors, social workers, etc., involved in the agencies, and in Canada we absolutely require psychological counselling prior to engaging in a surrogacy.

I will start with the less emotional one and look to the counsellors.  They made valid points.  It is important for couples on this journey and is the first thing they have to do.  We need to distinguish that we have same-sex couples who are not at the end of a big IVF journey or do not, perhaps, include a woman who has encountered health issues.  We need to acknowledge that they have rights and need to also have counselling and supports.  For opposite-sex couples, there is an element of mourning the losses, the hopes and the anticipated things of the future, like no one will ever say your child looks like you, perhaps, because they will assume, or people will make assumptions around the birth.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  Would we have objectivity questions if the same counsellor was counselling and supporting both the surrogate mother and the intended parents?

One is the United States.  That is for clients who are so wealthy their last name is famous in Canada.  Surrogacy in the United States is expensive and some people prefer to pay a surrogate and you cannot do that in Canada.  You are only able to reimburse them for expenses.  The other places I see people travel to included, formerly, Ukraine.  It was just about price differences.  People thought, maybe correctly, that it would be less expensive to engage in surrogacy in places like Ukraine.  Finally, as the Senator is probably aware, surrogacy in India used to be booming.

Marie had a clinic, Marie and an appointment, Marie had a scan.  It was never Sharon's scan or clinic because it was not my baby.<\/p> <p>  When the time came for delivery, I was lucky that the team at the hospital was amazing.  My husband was supporting me and was outside the room.  I went in, in my head, to have a procedure done because I was having a C-section.  We were screened off from each other.  I remember Lucy being born.  I remember that cry and a tear came down my eye.  With a sigh of relief, the baby was born.  Marie, John and Lucy left the room.  The nurses and doctors were amazing to me and I came back to the ward and met my niece for the first time, as I should.

It would be amazing if the legal side of things was rectified and, please God, before Lucy turns 18, things will be made right.  Even if Marie out here needed to be cared for, Lucy is her daughter and she needs to be able to do that but she cannot at the moment because she has no legal rights to her mammy either.  I cannot say any of this was about me; it is about Marie and Lucy.  I am good and strong and healthy and well, and we were very open as a family.  That is the way to be with this.

I absolutely commend Ms O'Shea and Ms Reid on their courage in coming here to outline their especially personal circumstances and to fight for their nieces and nephews.  Becoming a surrogate is such a courageous step to take, although I acknowledge they have both told us it was not courageous but rather was just something they needed to do.

Do any of our guests have advice they would like to use this platform to share with families who are having these discussions?  One issue I struggle with, and I have asked this question of a number of the experts who have appeared before us, relates to how we in Ireland can ensure international surrogacy is carried out in accordance with the Verona Principles and our other standards in cases where we deal with countries where we have no control over the standards they have in place or over their laws governing agencies?  I was struck when Ms Cohen said not many people in Canada travel for international surrogacy, so I do not know whether it is fair to ask her the question.  Nevertheless, she gave us three examples of countries people there do deal with.  How is Canada navigating that?  For me, it is the big challenge.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Ms Oakes and Ms &Oacute; Tuama, I fully believe in the benefits of counselling when it comes to any fertility challenge.  I was especially interested to hear their recommendations in that regard for surrogacy, which come from the need to protect all the parties involved.  Through that lens of ensuring the full protection of everybody involved, should we consider making counselling more than voluntary and more than something people might just consider?  Does there need to be an assessment to ensure everybody is in the right frame of mind before entering agreements?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#G00500","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1344,"content":"<p>The first question related to how Ireland should concern itself with surrogacy happening in jurisdictions where it does not really have any control over how it works.  Perhaps there ought to be a list of requirements or issues Ireland should consider, such as whether surrogacy is legal in the jurisdiction where the child is to be born.  That is very important.  Obviously, the free and informed consent the Senator talked about is very important and can be provided in various ways, such as by affidavit or by a lawyer signing a certificate of independent legal advice.  I like the idea of a requirement for independent legal advice being provided to the surrogate, which is always very important.  If it were up to me, I also like the idea of a psychological screening.  Similarly, we must ensure not only that surrogacy is legal in the jurisdiction where it is to happen but that the intended parents are the legal parents in the jurisdiction because it can be a mess if, internationally, that child is nearly the child of the surrogate.  Finally, it is important to be sure about the citizenship of the child and to ensure he or she will be able to obtain Irish citizenship.  It can be very problematic if he or she is not and it can cause major problems.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about how Canada deals with children being born abroad through surrogacy.  Again, the number of children involved is not very large, but Canada does a few things.  In regard to citizenship, it used to require a genetic connection between an intended parent who is a Canadian citizen and the child being born.<\/p><p>We no longer require that.  We require that within the jurisdiction where the child is born, that child is legally the child of a Canadian citizen and therefore obtains citizenship, which is wonderful.  It makes very good sense, especially for non-heteronormative family building.<\/p><p> Regarding its oversight, documents need to be provided to Canadian ministries.  One of them is to establish if there is a surrogacy agreement written and in place.  There are exactly the kinds of questions this committee has been asking about things like free and informed consent, and independent legal advice.  Canada concerns itself that the hospital bills have been paid for in the other country to ensure people are not taking advantage of the other country.  We require some things that are a bit more obvious such as the Canadian birth certificates of the intended parents, etc.  We want the birth certificate of the jurisdiction and ideally a court order after birth.  It is not just a pre-birth order because we do not recognise pre-birth orders in Canada.  We only recognise post-birth orders that the child is legally the child of the intended parents.  That is how we handle that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Cohen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1346,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question on the role that counselling should play.

If somebody can get pregnant freely and easily, nobody checks on them and yet those who require assistance are checked up on.  I would rather if this were framed for people as being a chance to get information.  It is a space in which people can have those conversations and go through those things.

The biggest issue is the legal side of things.  People need to have the proper paperwork in place.  People need to know where they stand in future.  At the moment, Marie, John, Patrick and I are definitely in limbo.  The names of intended parents need to be on the birth certificate.  Lucy was born by surrogacy.  That is okay; I have that document.  However, a surrogate does not give someone a legal right to a baby or anything.  The names of the intended parents need to be on the birth certificate.  We need honesty and openness around the whole issue.  Talking and reaching out to people in this situation definitely help.

It has been very emotional.  We cannot overstate how important it is to hear from Ms Reid and Ms O'Shea.  It is invaluable to us.  As the last speaker, I run the risk of repeating what has been said.  I really appreciate it.  It is really important for the people who are listening in.  There is a myth around surrogacy that it is scary.  The witnesses have set out the position very clearly, particularly when they say that in terms of birth certificates and processing, they completely regard their sisters as the mothers.  They are and that is the reality of it.  That is invaluable not for just for us but for anybody who may not understand surrogacy and how it might work.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Ms Cohen has appeared before the committee to outline the Canadian model.  I have recently read about it and have looked into it.  She mentioned that altruistic surrogacy in Canada is broader than it might be deemed to be.  I ask her to explain that a little more.  If we were to adopt that kind of process, how might it work?  Senator Seery Kearney already asked about people from Canada travelling internationally.  That has already been covered.  Ms Cohen said they do not do pre-birth registration, but I had understood her to say in her opening statement that there was a two-stage transfer process.  I ask her to elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms Reid and Ms O'Shea.  Some really brilliant ladies, who had been born through surrogacy, appeared before the committee a few weeks ago.  One of them suggested that everyone's birth certificate should have something on the back pointing to a website for more information.  People could then get find out more information online, particularly if there was no family connection to the surrogate.  I ask Ms Reid and Ms O'Shea for their thoughts about that or having some sort of register of information.  I agree that the names of intended parents should be on the birth certificate in case somebody at a later age wishes to get access to information that they might not necessarily find through family.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Fertility Counsellors Association does really good work.  While it is not undervalued by the people the counsellors see, it may be undervalued by others in society.  It can be a very lonely place for those trying to start a family and experiencing infertility.  It is something that can be dismissed by many people.  There is a mindset whereby people say, \"Sure, aren't you lucky?\"  Irish people have a terrible habit of telling people that it could be worse when something terrible happens.  For many people it could not be worse and they do not feel they are very lucky.<\/p><p>At times there seems to be a just get on with it attitude.  The service that the witnesses offer is invaluable and we need to promote it more.  I assume they do not receive any funding.  If that is the case, perhaps that is something this committee could explore in the context of our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#H00800","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654124400,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked about how we handle altruistic surrogacy in Canada.  Under our legislation, we are not allowed to pay a surrogate and doing so is punishable by up to ten years in jail and-or a fine of $500,000.  However, we have always been allowed to reimburse the surrogate for any expenses she incurs as a result of the surrogacy.  A couple of years ago Health Canada provided a list of various categories for which we are allowed to reimburse the surrogate and they are actually quite generous.  The idea behind that was not to have surrogates for whom only the very smallest things were covered but to treat them well and in a way that we would want to be treated ourselves.  If I am eight months pregnant, for example, there is no way I am going to clean a bathroom floor on my hands and knees and neither should a surrogate, so we can help with things like housekeeping and so on, as long as it is reasonable.  The surrogate must provide receipts and other documentary evidence showing what she has spent during the surrogacy within those categories.  Sometimes there is oversight by her doctor, who will write off that something is necessary or recommended.  That is how we handle it.  No specific cap is imposed by the government.  As long as the expense is reasonable and is related to the surrogacy, then people can go ahead and pay it.  That is how we handle that and it works beautifully.  Having that list is very helpful because we know what is payment and what is reimbursement.  It is quite nice.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the benefit of using post-birth orders, I want to clarify a point I made earlier.  When I said the surrogate provides her consent twice, what I meant is that she does it prior to transfer first by entering into the gestational surrogacy agreement.  A big part of that is her consenting not to be a parent of this child and making sure that is very, very clear.  We get her consent again that she does not want to be a parent of this child after the baby has been born.  We think it is very important to have these orders for everybody, particularly for all of our international intended parents who engage in surrogacy in Canada.  In the case of non-heteronormative family building, it is very helpful because people have questions, whether they ought to or not, about who is a parent in those situations.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of whether it is necessary to do a pre-birth order or a post-birth order, our experience in Canada is that we have never had a gestational surrogate try to keep the baby.  To some extent, while I do not want to call it a waste of time, it has not proven to be necessary to wait until after the baby is born because we do not have surrogates trying to keep the baby.  It just puts everyone in a funny position, as we heard from the lovely women who had been surrogates in Ireland.  It is a short delay time for us but in that delay time, while we are waiting for the post-birth order, it could be confusing and problematic.  Honestly, my experience is that surrogates just want to go home.  They are not a parent so they do not need to be there anymore.  They want to go ahead.  We only have post-birth orders in Canada and that makes sense to me.  It gives comfort to those people who are a little less comfortable with the concept of surrogacy, who have less experience of it, who have not had the benefit of speaking to the amazing people who have been surrogates and who are concerned that a surrogate might want to keep a child.  Having the post-birth order makes sense but do I actually think it is necessary?  For us, it has not proven to be necessary to do post-birth as opposed to pre-birth orders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Cohen"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>Thank you.

However, technically, although there is not a document or a birth certificate, the surrogate is the legal parent for those seven days until everyone has registered.  In respect of the latter, the surrogate gives her consent that she is not a parent and signs certain documents in front a lawyer and the parents sign certain documents stating that they are the parents, have done all these steps properly, etc.  For those first few days, the surrogate is technically the legal parent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#K00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Sara Cohen"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1366,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022060200002#K00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1654124400,"counter":1367,"content":"<p>I have a few questions.

Is there regulation of those intermediaries?  We all came to this committee with preconceived ideas about this issue.  We have learned a great deal in recent weeks.  Ireland seems to deal with this issue in the same way as we do with many complex and emotional issues, namely, by sticking our heads in the sand and pretending there is no problem, the consequence of which is to leave many vulnerable people at risk.  We have an opportunity to progress this, draw a line under it and get it regulated.  What impact would it have on the witnesses, their families or the people with whom they deal if this does not progress quickly through the Dail?  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill does not provide for retrospectively regulating nor does not it take account of international practice.  Would would the impact of that be?

It is a little bit confusing the way our law is written <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>those intermediaries and the way we as a federation works.  These must be regulated at a provincial level.  I would like it to be regulated not exactly the same way as an adoption agency, but in the same way as we have licensing and regulation requirements for such an agency.  It would be very helpful to have the same for a surrogacy agency.  We do not have that.  The only jurisdiction I can think of in North America that has that is New York state, but that is a little bit outside my wheelhouse.  Currently, these are businesses like any other business.  Most of them are run by former surrogates.  Many of those former surrogates are counsellors, social workers, etc., and that is how it works.
