The Department was allowed to carry &euro;4.1 million over to 2021, to fund capital works, but surrendered almost &euro;119 million at the year end.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure incurred in 2020 was distributed across five output programmes.  The largest area of spending was the children and family support programme, in relation to which expenditure of &euro;876 million was incurred in 2020.  That is up about 5% on 2019.  The bulk of this programme expenditure - 97% - was accounted for by funding of &euro;848 million provided to the Child and Family Agency, better known as Tusla.\u00a0 This included special Covid-related funding of &euro;8 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just under &euro;24\u00a0million was expended under the programme in respect of the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.<\/p> <p>  Programme B comprises funding for a wide range of schemes and programmes to benefit children and young people, including early childhood care and education support, and the national child care scheme.\u00a0 The account records programme spending of &euro;601 million in 2020, including almost &euro;83 million on Covid-related supports.\u00a0 Most of the spending under programme B is channelled to the beneficiaries through Pobal, which acts as a paying agent for the Department under a service level agreement.

The more detailed briefing document, which was supplied in advance of the meeting, sets out the estimated provisions, outturns and variance explanations for each of the subheads, along with further details on specific topics of procurement and international protection.  I hope that will be of assistance to the committee in providing a fuller picture of the work of the Department and its expenditure.<\/p> <p>  As we all know, 2020 was an extraordinary year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  In common with all public bodies, the Department was forced to change the way we delivered services and rethink approaches to sustaining our objectives to enhance the lives of children and young people, adults, families and communities, recognise diversity and promote equality of opportunity.  The year 2020 also saw a significant increase in both the size and responsibilities of the Department.  On the formation of the new Government, it was decided to assign significant additional responsibilities to the former Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  These included international protection, equality and disability policies, which transferred in from the Department of Justice as well as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Disability Authority.\u00a0 The transfer brought almost 100 staff members and a substantial increase in funding to the Vote.  Some minor youth justice areas transferred out at this time also to the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>Responsibility for education welfare functions, under Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, transferred to the Department of Education with effect from 1 January 2021<b>.  <\/b>As part of the new disability remit, the transfer of responsibility for specialist community-based disability services from the Department of Health is due to be completed soon, following the recent passage of the relevant legislation and extensive preparatory work by both Departments and the HSE.  This final transfer of functions will bring together key disability policy and service elements and result in a major increase in the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  <br\/><br\/>In summary, following the changes announced by the incoming Taoiseach in 2020, the Department retained virtually all of the responsibilities of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as well as assuming significant additional functions in relation to equality, integration and international protection.  The reconfigured Department therefore closed the year with five programme areas, which encompass child protection and welfare, prevention and early intervention, adoption, family supports, early learning and childcare, youth services and youth justice, as well as equality, integration, international protection and disability policy.  <br\/><br\/>Turning to the Vote, the total provision for 2020 was &euro;1.837 billion.  In terms of overall composition, the majority of this was focused on three areas: Tusla, the Child and Family Agency; early years care and education; and international protection seekers' accommodation.  The current expenditure provision was &euro;1.796 billion, with a further &euro;41 million allocated to capital expenditure.  The net provision was &euro;1 billion when appropriations-in-aid of &euro;36.5 million are taken into account.  The outturn for the Vote was &euro;1.677 billion, with a surplus of &euro;123 million, of which &euro;4.1 million was deferred.  <br\/><br\/>The major factor impacting the level of activities and expenditure in 2020 was the Covid-19 pandemic.  Delayed recruitment, cancelled travel, reduced capital expenditure and service closures impacted on spending on schemes such as early childhood care and education, ECCE, and the access and inclusion model, AIM, as well as on international protection services as a result of slowed migration of international protection seekers.  On the other hand, the response to the pandemic necessitated additional spending allocations to the Child and Family Agency of &euro;8 million and to Covid-related supports for providers in early learning and care and school-age childcare to a value of &euro;109.5 million.  These additional supports were funded from savings realised within the Vote.  <br\/><br\/>The largest savings were realised in two areas, the first being under programme E, international protection seekers' accommodation, which finished the year with a surplus of &euro;17.4 million, or 9% of its 2020 provision.  Some increased costs were incurred in ensuring compliance with public health requirements during the pandemic, offsetting some of the savings.<br\/><br\/>The second area of significant underspend was within the three combined early learning and care subheads in programme B, which incorporates the ECCE and AIM childcare schemes as well as the national childcare scheme.  There was an underspend of &euro;55.6 million or 12% of the &euro;480.8 million in these areas.  The biggest factor was the closure of the national childcare scheme for 12 weeks and the lower than anticipated uptake of the scheme once it reopened, as well as the suspension of the ECCE and AIM schemes.  It should be noted that a large portion of the early learning and care subhead&rsquo;s original provision was reallocated to Covid-related spending in the sector in the form of specific supports<b><i>.  <\/i><\/b><br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the significant efforts of staff across the Department, our agencies and the wider sector in managing the impact of Covid-19 in 2020.  The early learning and care sector and Tusla were particularly impacted in differing ways.  It is to its strong credit that Tusla continued to deliver critical front-line services throughout the pandemic.  In the early learning and care sector, the Department moved quickly to put in place supports to sustain the sector and retain capacity to the greatest extent possible during periods of service closure and reduced demand, working with the sector to ensure sustainability and protect services and service affordability for parents.  The Department worked closely across Government and with sector representatives to develop and target supports that aligned with wider initiatives such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, along with capital and reopening support packages.  Other areas within the Vote also responded to the unique challenges presented by the pandemic, including international protection, youth justice and youth services.<br\/><br\/>As we emerge from these pandemic-related challenges, the Department faces new challenges that are again unprecedented in nature and scale.  I refer to the effects of the war in Ukraine, which has precipitated a humanitarian crisis and impacted enormously on the work of the Department over the past three months through our efforts to provide safe shelter and accommodation to those who have come here in crisis in their many thousands under the EU&rsquo;s temporary protection directive.  The responsibility for making immediate accommodation arrangements for those seeking it falls to our Department under our international protection responsibilities.  <br\/><br\/>We are happy to play our part in meeting the needs of displaced Ukrainians seeking asylum.  The increased scale, pace and unpredictability of demand for accommodation has posed major challenges which continue to be managed on a daily basis.  As of 31 May, 23,894 beneficiaries of temporary protection have sought accommodation through our service.  All available avenues of additional short-term accommodation have been and are being explored in seeking to increase available capacity to meet this demand.  We have had to move quickly to build internal teams to manage the response in all of its aspects, through reassigning staff from other roles and bringing in additional support where we can.  We have relied heavily on the support of local authorities in meeting immediate emergency accommodation needs as they arise and taken all necessary urgent actions to ensure that the daily requirements of managing the unprecedented inflow of people involved can be met.  We will continue to seek to respond to this crisis as it evolves over the coming weeks and months and this will have a significant impact on costs in the Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and beyond.  <br\/><br\/>I pay tribute to my colleagues in the Department for their response to the huge demands of the current crisis and for the wider contributions they have made in continuing to deliver on a range of objectives since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention and am happy to take questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

With significant responsibility in the transfer of community-based disability services, the Department will get even busier.  There is a lot happening and that is to be appreciated.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on the opening comments from the Comptroller and Auditor General which drew attention to the disclosure from the Accounting Officer around the non-compliance with procurement rules in relation to international protection accommodation services, IPAS.  He spoke about the vast majority of non-compliance procurement, over 87%, in 2022 relating to IPAS centres and emergency accommodation.

His opening comments are appreciated.  On the non-compliant expenditure identified in the 2020 accounts, it is important to acknowledge the context whereby, in providing accommodation for international protection seekers, the Department meets an unpredictable level or scale of demand.  It is demand-led and a real-time response is required.  The system tends to come under continual pressure and in 2020 there was a context involving Covid and the requirements of public health compliance which involved having to thin out the accommodation numbers in any congregated setting.  That put pressure on the emergency response at that time.<\/p> <p>  The previous Department, in seeking to provide for international protection accommodation, ran a number of regional tendering competitions between 2018 and 2021.<\/p><p>At a point in time, it became clear that that was not going to meet the requirements of the demand that was presenting and expressions of interest were sought through national and local newspapers to try to bring additional accommodation on stream as it was required.  There was a competitive element to that but, when the functions transferred in, the view was taken by our own procurement team that while much of the accommodation was procured competitively, it was not compliant with the regulations and, therefore, should have been noted in the circular 40\/02 return.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr.  Kevin McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>With regard to the 151 contracts in 2020, have new competitions been extended out or has there been a request for tender, RFT, for these current contracts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#C00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654158600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>What has happened since is that a large-scale request for tender was published on 18 January of this year, with a closing date of 21 February.  A compliance check process on the responses that were received had commenced on 28 February.  That was paused when the Ukraine crisis broke as we had to divert staff resources to meet the immediate need of the Ukraine crisis.  We have since been in a position to recommence the compliance checks as part of that RFT so we will see additional accommodation coming on stream on foot of that.  Although I am not in a position to say, I would expect that some of the contracts that were placed in 2020 and 2021 will be regularised through that process.<\/p> <p>  It is important to also say that overall demand for international protection has been growing hugely.  We have seen 4,500 people seeking international protection so far this year.  The context is that our projections for this year would have been 3,500 for the full year and we have seen 4,500 to date, so the numbers are increasing very significantly, which is going to continue to put us under pressure in terms of an emergency response.<\/p> <p>  The original intention in running the RFT was to try to move away from our reliance on emergency accommodation and emergency centres and, as the Deputy will be aware, there is a White Paper for transitioning out of the model of direct provision that operates at the moment and an implementation plan has been in development around that.  The ultimate aim is to move to a different model and a different system of accommodating international protection seekers that would see them received in reception centres, moving on to phase 1 accommodation for a period and then moving on to a different type of accommodation in phase 2 beyond that.  The intention would be that all of that would be procured through normal, required procurement channels but, as I said, at the moment our overall capacity to respond is coming under pressure, not simply because of the Ukraine response, but also the international protection numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>In terms of non-competitive procurement for 2021, does Mr. McCarthy feel the Department has decreased or increased the &euro;91 million figure that was there for 2020?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#C00400","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1654158600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>There is a lower number of contracts in 2021, that is, 54 contracts rather than 151, but of a similar value, so it will be up around the &euro;90 million mark again for 2021.

We have a large number of very small operators, many of them with great passion and commitment.  However, in many cases the current model of pay per child per use does not do anything to help them meet the capital costs of providing that service.

It shows, however, that the only logical way forward is for us to move towards a system whereby the State largely funds childcare in a more direct way and with more control over governance.  A total of 14% of contracts under ECCE were identified as being non-compliant, but I have concerns about whether that phrase is even appropriate in this context.  These are very small operations in some cases, and we are holding them to account for being non-compliant when the Department itself is struggling with non-compliant procurement.

There is quite a high bar for compliance because in the inspection regime, depending on the scheme, there could be anything from 28 to 44, and beyond, compliance checks.  Where a provider is found to be non-compliant on a small number of those, it is deemed to be non-compliant.  The compliance regime is very much about trying to support providers in identifying where they are not compliant and to rectify that and take actions to get to a level of compliance.  Sanctions do not kick in until successive non-compliance is found through successive inspections.  There are a number of means through which those providers that are found to be non-compliant can be supported through support funding and so on to help them to address the findings that are identified.<\/p> <p>  The intention, which is very much underpinned by the new model, relates to a public private partnership and to the State becoming much more involved as a co-founder of activity in the sector, in return for which providers sign up to fee arrangements that involve no increase in fees for parents and, ultimately, reductions in fees for parents.  It is about trying to move what has historically been a very independent sector into being a publicly funded and publicly supported model of provision, recognising the vital importance of early years education and care for the development of children and the State's absolute responsibility to ensure that is funded, supported and overseen in terms of quality.  The compliance aspect is important in providing parents with the assurance that the quality of provision their child is getting in a given setting is tested and benchmarked against expected standards and that the provider is supported in achieving those standards where it is falling short, for whatever reason.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is correct.

Sometimes that involves camp beds in community halls or other congregated types of settings, which are not of a standard that we would want to be providing to people and are not sustainable in terms of offering anything more than immediate accommodation on arrival, but there would obviously be a requirement for fire safety standards to be met as a minimum.  Local authorities would inspect any premises that are in use, if there was any concern around the standard of what is on offer.  However, it is the case that while we endeavour to secure and provide the best accommodation that is available to us, we have been securing accommodation that would be of a standard that, overall, we would not wish to be putting people into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>What would Mr. McCarthy's views be on a development in County Meath of between 500 and 600 units by two organisations with regard to provision of accommodation for Ukrainian refugees?

Obviously, the most important aspect of foster care is that it meets the best interests of the child.  However, there are different costs depending on what is available, and whether it is with a family member, a foster parent or a private provider.  I received a reply to a parliamentary question some time ago in relation to the number on the panel and the number of children.  In some locations, there is a clear shortage of foster parents.  Is that the determining factor?  I imagine that there is specialised care required for some children, but what would be the determining factor?  What involvement would the Department have in that general policy in placing children or in deciding?

Tusla is developing a new foster care strategy that it plans to bring to its board in July.  In advance of that, it has produced a proposal on foster care rates which is with us now.  We are engaging with them on that.   Obviously, there are budgetary implications to any change on that and we need to reside any proposal for change as part of an overall strategy for supporting foster care.  We absolutely recognise the importance and value of foster care.  Some 90% of children in care are in foster care.  It is a means of supporting children in need that we are absolutely reliant on as a State and it is entirely appropriate that we would support foster carers appropriately.

Frankly, having to wait for another review and another report in a situation where we now face record levels of inflation is of huge concern.  It is a point that has been made repeatedly by different organisations that have come to my office.  I know it is an issue throughout the country.  There are families who are to the pins of their collars.  We have to deal with this problem up-front and come up with a plan rather than waiting for another budgetary cycle to see what the Department may or may not do.  If there is a surplus coming in to 2022, and I hope that there will not be a surplus for the accounts in 2021, that there is some focus on that area.<\/p> <p>  I understand that of the Department's funding streams available to youth organisations and youth clubs, much is devolved into local organisations.

I want to make the point that the surplus that arose in 2020 was very much a one-off in the context of the impact of Covid on a range of activities across the Department's Vote.  We sought to reuse funding to the best extend possible through putting a range of additional Covid supports in place to sustain in particular the early years sector where the viability and survival of providers would have been at risk if we were not in a position to do that as a result of the fall-off in service demand.  All that was a one-off.  I would not expect to see surpluses of that scale materialise in subsequent years.  It would not be an option to divert what was a one-off saving in a particular year into a base-level adjustment.  Something like changing rates of payment for foster carers would be a permanent change of your cost base.  It obviously has to be negotiated and agreed through the normal budgetary cycle.<\/p> <p>  On youth services, we have a lot of interaction with the education and training boards which oversee the delivery of youth services funding on behalf of the Department.

I come from Youghal.  That is one of the areas I, as a Deputy, represent.  I do not mean to be parochial but I want to use it as a good example.  We find it very challenging to get funding down from the ETB to support programmes that are put in place through Departmental funding.  Cork is a huge county.  There is a city and county with a very large geographical area and different needs.  There is an inner city through the local authority, Cork City Council, and there is a lot of social deprivation and many different issues that require huge State investment to try to improve.<\/p><p>However, there are also many rural towns where further investment needs to be put in for the benefit of children who come from backgrounds where, unfortunately, there are significant problems.  Such children need additional support.  That is something I want to highlight.  With regard to rural towns, particularly those sharing with city centres, the Department is devolving funding to organisations but it is not reaching where it is needed.  There is not a fair and equitable balance in the devolution of that funding.  I have come across this on more than one occasion and, quite frankly, I am sick of it.  It is not fair.  It is particularly not fair on rural constituencies in counties like Cork where there are significant major settlements like Cork city that have their own needs.  They need to be separated out from an education and training board, ETB, point of view when it comes to the provision of funds for very worthy projects.  I came across this recently with regard to the Garda youth diversion projects.  We raised the matter at a ministerial level but were unsuccessful.  That is really disappointing.  More has to be done on policing.  I will ask the question again.

We should ask the Secretary General to clarify his own views on the matter and we should ask for an apology to members of the committee if it did happen.  It is totally unacceptable.  The Oireachtas is the body held accountable by the public and all Departments are answerable to the Oireachtas and to the duly elected government.  We do not know for sure whether the comments were made but they have certainly been reported as direct speech.  I propose we ask for the Department of Health&rsquo;s view on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#CC01400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":557,"content":"<p>This is not the first time some derogatory remarks have been made about the committee in general.

Horse Sport Ireland has 24 affiliates ranging from pony clubs to Olympic-level organisations.  There is a real mix there and getting one facility that caters for all of their needs is difficult.  In case people think I know what I am talking about, I must say that other people have told me this.  Essentially, Horse Sport Ireland gets the bulk of its funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, with &euro;6 out of every &euro;7 coming from that source.  Horse Sport Ireland wanted to get a permanent facility and that is fine.  It then had to decide where to locate it, with a view to meeting the needs of all of its affiliates.  However, none of the affiliates was consulted in advance and some of them have real issues with the decision of Horse Sport Ireland.  The site chosen is located in an industrial estate in west Dublin and it simply will not meet the needs of some of the affiliates.  It is a 30 acre site and some of the land has been sterilised or frozen from further development because part of it will be needed for the extension of the link to the N3, N4 and N7.  This roads objective could be problematic and may mean that it will not be possible to expand the site into the future in one particular direction.  Furthermore, the current planning permission has restrictions attached, including that the facility must be for private use.  It expressly prohibits competition or other commercial activities.

If public money is going to be spent, can the facility actually function and meet their requirements?  Can it expand in the future?  It is a lease as opposed to a purchase and I think there are questions to be answered.  Public money is being spent.  Horse Sport Ireland receives quite a bit of funding from the Department and I would have thought that there should have been a high level of engagement with the affiliates on this.  I do not know where this is at right now but wish to draw attention to it.  I have also done that in the D&aacute;il by way of a Topical Issue and have raised it with the Department.  I am unhappy with the Department's stand-off approach to some of the organisations it funds.  The Department tells us that the organisations are independent and while we do not want to see the Minister getting involved in the day-to-day running of an organisation, some level of oversight in the context of the spending of public money is required.

The correspondence is dated 27 May and provides information requested by the committee regarding the awarding of contracts to provide meals for Ukrainian refugees.  It is proposed to note and to publish this item of correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

Is everybody happy?  That is good.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  The first such item is No. 1263 C, dated 24 May.  It is from an individual who has corresponded with the committee regarding social welfare appeals.  The correspondent asks if the committee has found evidence of test cases being used by the social welfare appeals office and the Department.  It is proposed to provide the correspondent with a copy of our report on the examination of the 2019 Appropriation Account for Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  That report records our position on the matter arising from the evidence that was presented to us.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  In the report it is set out clearly that there was evidence of test cases being used at some level.<\/p><p>It is to be hoped that will clarify the matter for the respondent.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> No. 1261 is from Atheist Ireland, dated 24 May 2022.  On receipt of previous correspondence from Atheist Ireland concerning the constitutional provisions regarding education, the committee sought responses from the Department of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The Department advised that it intended to meet with Atheist Ireland to discuss the issues and we forwarded the responses from it and the NCCA.  The meeting has now taken place and Atheist Ireland states that the Department has undertaken to reflect on the views of Atheist Ireland and acknowledges that the Department is acting in good faith.  That is good.  Essentially, Atheist Ireland takes issue with the Department of Education&rsquo;s funding of schools that, in its view, do not abide by the constitutional conditions for that funding.  Atheist Ireland requests that the committee examine the matter.  It is clear there is ongoing engagement between the Department and Atheist Ireland.  It is also clear that the matter turns on constitutional interpretation and it is not the role of the committee to adjudicate on that interpretation.  The policy that flows from such interpretation is not a matter for the committee either and would be more appropriate to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is proposed to advise Atheist Ireland accordingly.  Does any member wish to address this item of correspondence?  Members are happy enough with it.<\/p><p> I will move on to the work programme.  As next week is a non-sitting week, our next meeting will be on 16 June, when we will engage with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I hope we will have some of those answers before then.<\/p><p> On 23 June, we will engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine its oversight of local government expenditure of central government funds.  The Department has confirmed availability for the meeting and the Association of Irish Local Government has indicated it will nominate representatives to attend.<\/p><p> We had planned to engage with An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 30 June but its representatives are not available until 14 July, which is the last scheduled sitting for this term.  Is it agreed to schedule the meeting for 14 July?  Agreed.  A representative from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also be in attendance.  In terms of the agenda, An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s 2020 financial statements are available to us to examine.  Are there any other specific areas of interest that members wish to put on the agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022060200002#EE03900","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1654158600,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Again, I would like to see a meeting with the Department of Foreign Affairs slotted in.
