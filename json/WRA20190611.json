The target for 2019 is for the delivery of an additional 931 housing supports in County Wexford, comprising 353 homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and 578 households to be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, which will have a significant impact on further reducing Wexford's housing list. <\/p>  <p>  A substantial focus of all stakeholders is to increase supply through new build activity.

The low rate of fixed interest associated with the RIHL provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not have otherwise been able to afford at a higher interest rate.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme allows low-income first time buyers aged between 18 and 70 who cannot secure a mortgage from a commercial lender, to access sustainable mortgage finance that is designed to enable them to purchase a new or second-hand property, or undertake a self-build, within a suitable price range. Applicants must be in continuous employment for a minimum of two years (primary earner) or one year (secondary earner).  For single applicants, the income limit is &euro;50,000, rising to &euro;75,000 for joint applicants. The maximum price range for the value of a house that can be purchased under the scheme is &euro;320k in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow and &euro;250k elsewhere. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the competitive borrowing achieved by the Housing Finance Agency, local authorities can offer a first tranche of fixed rate annuity finance to eligible borrowers at rates of 2.0% and 2.25% per annum, for twenty five and thirty years, respectively. Placing ceilings on the value of properties that may be purchased and aligning the terms of the loan with the Loan-to-Value elements of the Central Bank prudential lending rules guard against possible inflationary impacts on the market.   <\/p>  <p>  Towards the end of last year I asked my Department to undertake a review of the scheme's operation. In carrying out the review, the Department has consulted with a number of local authorities, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency.

I also signed regulations on 12 March 2019 under which local authorities make their Schemes of Priority, which provide the administrative framework through which affordable homes will ultimately be allocated under the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Prioritising geographical areas for operation of the scheme is informed by economic assessments which local authorities have completed in relation to the affordability issues in their areas.  Delivery of affordable housing is to be supported using the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) which will utilise a budget of &euro;310 million to provide site infrastructure support to help make available approximately 6,200 affordable homes over the next three years.  An initial 10 projects have been approved for &euro;43 million of funding under the first call for proposals under the Fund.  A second call issued on 9 April 2019, in response to which 30 submissions were received from 15 local authorities. These are currently being assessed by my Department and I intend to announce approvals under this second call in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Guidelines","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[23881\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when new rural housing guidelines will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[23999\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the revised rural housing planning guidelines will issue taking into account the Flemish Decree judgment of the European Court; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 88 together.<\/p>  <p>  Following engagement between the European Commission and my Department regarding the European Court of Justice ruling in the \"Flemish Decree\" case, a working group was established to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 Planning Guidelines on Sustainable Rural Housing, issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.

For 2019 alone, funding of almost &euro;2.4 billion is being provided for all housing programmes, a 25% increase on the 2018 allocation. This investment will see the housing needs of almost 27,400 households being met, of which 10,000 will be new social housing homes delivered through build, acquisition and long term leasing programmes, with the remaining supports being delivered through HAP and RAS schemes.<\/p><p>Local authorities deliver a wide range of public services, including those in relation to housing.

Therefore, it is not possible to compare absolute levels of funding received in local authority areas, as to do so would not reflect the significant differences that exist between them. Indeed, it is a matter for each local authority to maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. <\/p><p>Funding is available to support every local authority in delivering on their social housing targets and my Department will engage with any local authority in a position to deliver beyond its targets.

Local authorities levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV) is applied to the valuation of each property, to obtain the amount payable in rates. The ARV is a reserved function decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.  The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  The national average ARV decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly each year from 2016 to 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, while economic activity has been expanding significantly in recent years, the overall rates income of local authorities nationally has remained relatively unchanged. The rates payable by individual businesses may change because of the impact of the revaluation programme being undertaken by the Commissioner of Valuation, or as a result of a stand-alone revision of a property's valuation. <\/p>  <p>  Reasons for valuation increases may be that the valuation of some properties had not been revised to take account of improvements or extensions for some time, or where the valuations were historically low in comparison with the general level of valuations on the valuation list.  In overall terms, I understand that of the revaluations conducted to date under the revaluation programme, approximately 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced and approximately 40% have experienced an increase.  Additionally, gradual rates harmonisation across new local authority areas, following the merger of town and county councils in 2014, may have led to increases in certain areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his statutory functions and the setting of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, on a phased basis, the first revaluation of that scale, encompassing all rating authority areas, in over 160 years. <\/p>  <p>  The revaluation provisions in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provide a modern statutory framework for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property and changes in the local business environment.   <\/p>  <p>  Having up to date and consistent valuations, reflecting current market conditions, is critical to ensure that the levying of commercial rates is on a fair, equitable and consistent basis across all economic sectors and parts of the country and is the purpose of the national revaluation programme. The revaluation process includes comprehensive communication and appeals mechanisms. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the revaluation promotes equity across sectors and areas, but is also a revenue neutral exercise in overall terms, the Minister may limit the total amount of rates collectable within the local authority in the year following a revaluation to that collected in the previous year, subject to minor adjustments. <\/p>  <p>  In order to further improve the regime for the levying and collection of commercial rates, the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is currently before the Oireachtas. The Bill is a key priority of my Department and, when enacted, will facilitate more effective and streamlined rates collection procedures. Included in the provisions of the Bill are:<\/p>  <p> - the removal of the requirement for ratepayers to pay their annual bill in two instalments (moieties) and provision to allow ratepayers to pay rates by instalments or through a payment plan agreed with the local authority;<\/p>  <p> - schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties;<\/p>  <p> - the levying of interest on unpaid and overdue rates; and<\/p>  <p> - the rendering of unpaid rates to be a charge on relevant property.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Bill includes provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes, which would include schemes to support the implementation of the Government's Realising Our Rural Potential: The Action Plan for Rural Development.<\/p>  <p>  Further measures are currently being examined with a view to their introduction to the Bill at Committee Stage<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Data","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[24007\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100059#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the social housing direct build target for 2019 for Galway city and county councils; the number of social homes constructed in the local authority areas to date in 2019; the number of social housing direct builds in the local authorities in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":65,"content":"<p>Earlier this year, I met with local authority Chief Executives to discuss the progress made in their local area, in terms of delivering on the social housing targets under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>In 2018, 4,251 new build social housing homes were delivered, a very significant 85% increase on the 2,297 new builds in 2017.

It is now my intention to deliver on the will of the people of Limerick without delay. Significant work on the proposal has already been carried out in the form of the published document \"Directly Elected Mayors with Executive Functions: Detailed Policy Proposals\" approved by the Government on 20 March 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Under Section 44 of the Local Government Act 2019, the Minister is now required to prepare and submit to the Houses of the Oireachtas a report with legislative proposals for a directly elected mayor for Limerick. There is a further significant piece of work required to systematically analyse all legislation conferring functions and powers on local authority chief executives and this will involve consultation with key stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Report and legislative proposals must be submitted by 24 May 2021, two years after the plebiscite vote. However, I have asked my Department to prioritise this work with a view to bringing the Report and legislative proposals forward at the earliest opportunity.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Government's proposal, a full 5 year term of office for the directly elected mayor with executive functions is envisaged, with elections taking place with local elections. However, a possible election date in 2022 was identified for the first directly elected mayor, with a consequently shorter first term envisaged up to the next local elections in 2024. <\/p>  <p>  In the expectation that the preparatory work can be carried out and the legislative process is prioritised in the Oireachtas, the first election for mayor could take place in Limerick City and County Council in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The people of Cork City and Waterford City and County narrowly rejected the Government's proposals in the recent plebiscites in those local authority areas, and I fully respect the outcome of the votes there. In accordance with the legislation, the priority now is on delivering the mandate given by the people of Limerick.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Dublin, work is underway in the Department of the Taoiseach on proposals for the establishment of a new Citizens&rsquo; Assembly to consider a number of issues, including the issue of a directly elected mayor for Dublin and the form that this should take.

Consideration is being given to the parameters of this and other topics and how best to optimise the use of an Assembly&rsquo;s time and the taxpayers money. Proposals are expected to come before Government shortly. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to Galway, as provisions enabling the amalgamation of Galway City and County Councils and the holding of a plebiscite on a directly elected mayor for Galway included in the Local Government Bill were not passed by the Oireachtas, a plebiscite did not proceed there last month.

The latest violence there has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, and displaced over 270,000 people last month, bringing the total number of displaced to over 300,000 since April. I am aware of the very alarming reports from medical professionals and other humanitarian organisations - including the organisation referred to by the Deputy - in relation to the situation there. I condemn in particular the airstrikes that are reported to have targeted medical facilities and schools, in contravention of international humanitarian law. Ireland will continue to call on all parties to uphold their ceasefire commitments, and cease military activities in the Idlib region. We will also continue to urge those with influence on the Syrian regime to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This upsurge in violence has also had a serious impact on critical civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, and the ability of humanitarian actors to carry out their activities has been severely compromised. I urge all actors to abide by UN deconfliction mechanisms to prevent further casualties and destruction, and to guarantee unrestricted access and safe channels for humanitarian assistance to reach those most in need. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria. Only a holistic and comprehensive political process can bring about a lasting end to the conflict. Ireland fully supports the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254.\u00a0 The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response, and our funding supports those in most need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25m contribution to Syria and the region this year, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. Our 2019 funding includes a contribution of &euro;2.5 million to the United Nation&rsquo;s Turkey Humanitarian Fund for the Syria Response (THF), which is supporting the emergency cross-border response to the current humanitarian situation in northwest Syria. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to follow the situation closely, and engage with the UN and other partners operating in the region as the situation unfolds. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100062#WRE03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100062#WRE04000"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[23634\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100062#WRE04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position in respect of the talks with the political parties in Northern Ireland and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland regarding the need to have the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive restored at an early date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>The absence of vital institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is of grave concern for the Government, as it is for the British Government. <\/p>  <p>  On 26 April, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May announced a new phase of political talks in Northern Ireland, involving the five main parties, together with the British and Irish Governments.

The report put forward options for further consideration, rather than recommendations, and any further consideration would require the participation of several Departments and organisations, including my own Department. The ten options are split into short, medium and long-term options. Five potential short-term options were identified as measures which could potentially be implemented within 18 months, i.e. within Budgets 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  One short-term option was to increase the mortgage interest deduction available to landlords.\u00a0 In this context, it should be noted that in Budget 2017, a phased unwinding of the restriction on interest deductibility over five years for all residential landlords was initiated. The second step, an increase from 80% to 85% deductibility, took effect from 1 January 2018.\u00a0 Budget 2019 accelerated progress in this area and, from 1 January 2019, the restoration of full mortgage interest deductibility for landlords of residential property has been in place.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A further option was to consider introducing Local Property Tax (LPT) deductibility for landlords. Earlier this year, the report of the interdepartmental review of LPT noted\u00a0that LPT is a relatively small expense and therefore is unlikely to make a significant difference to the position of any individual landlord in cash terms and so may not be regarded by landlords as a sufficient measure to encourage them to stay in or enter the rental market. The report also found that the measure would also have a deadweight cost in respect of landlords who do not intend to leave the rental market and would create a more favourable position for landlords of property compared to owner-occupiers, as owner-occupiers cannot claim a tax deduction for LPT. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I introduced another of the short-term options, deductibility for pre-letting expenditure for previously vacant properties. This measure applies to residential premises which have been vacant for at least 12 months and which are then let after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2017, i.e. after 25 December 2017. The expenditure is allowed as a deduction against rental income from that premises. It applies to expenses that would be allowable if they had been incurred while the property was let, such as the cost of repairs, insurance, maintenance and management of the property.\u00a0\u00a0Certain limitations are in place regarding this measure, for example the expenditure must have been incurred in the 12 months before the premises is let as a residential premises. \u00a0The total deduction allowed is capped at &euro;5,000 per vacant premises and the deduction will be clawed-back if the property ceases to be let as a residential premises within four years of the first letting. I prioritised this option as it was specifically designed to encourage an overall increase in housing supply by bringing currently vacant property back into residential use.<\/p>  <p>  The final short-term option was to improve the collection and sharing of data on the rental accommodation sector.\u00a0 A significant issue that hampered the progress of the Working Group was a lack of robust data on various elements of the housing market, due to the differing metrics used by the various agencies. The Housing Analytics Group, chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is currently active and a number of Departments and agencies are involved in its work, including the Residential Tenancies Board, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), Revenue and the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  Five of the options put forward in the report were medium-term and long-term options. Medium-term options are measures which work with the current tax system but might take longer to develop and implement, and as such would require a longer lead-in period. The long-term options look at the potential for more fundamental changes to the tax system, and so would require significantly greater resource commitments to progress.\u00a0 Consideration of these options will continue within the relevant time frames.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost rental and overall housing supply and that, in line with the Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose would be required. Ireland&rsquo;s past experience with tax incentives in the housing sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance when considering intervention in the rental sector. There are many competing priorities which must be considered when deciding which policy measures to introduce and the rental sector is just one of many other sectors that may require assistance and intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100064#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Availability","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100064#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[23452\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100064#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the motor tax relief and toll free relief available under the disabilities tax relief scheme continue to apply for vehicles being used as taxis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>Following contact between my\u00a0officials and the Deputy's office I understand that the Deputy is referring to the\u00a0motor tax and toll charges\u00a0applicable to taxis which qualify under the\u00a0Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle Grant Scheme.

To further support the work and power of the regulator, I am bringing forward the\u00a0Central Bank (amendment) Bill which will introduce an advanced\u00a0Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) which will, in tandem with new enhancements to the fitness and probity regime, help prevent something like the mortgage tracker issue happening again.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I would remind the Deputy that as Minister for Finance there are strict rules around how I can intervene even in banks in which the State has a shareholding.\u00a0The day to day operations of the banks are the sole\u00a0responsibility of the boards and management teams and each bank must be run on an independent and commercial basis.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to consumers or businesses.  The Deputy will appreciate that I, as Minister for Finance, cannot comment on individual cases mentioned in the details supplied relating to insurance matters.<\/p>  <p>  However, I acknowledge the problems faced by many small businesses and voluntary\/community associations in relation to the cost and availability of insurance as well as the frustrations that some may have with the pace of reform.  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that\u00a0 for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance.  I believe there has been significant progress in the implementation of the two CIWG Reports. Examples include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;<\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is currently reviewing the possibility of expanding is scope to cover business insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019;<\/p>  <p>  - amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p>  <p>  - the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,<\/p>  <p>  - various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the launch recently of Operation Coatee, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from April 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.4% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D'Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports' recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, you should note that\u00a0Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.  Insurance Ireland can be contacted at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761914.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100065#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Banking","counter":329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100065#WRH00600"},{"type":"question","counter":330,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[23743\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100065#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to introduce community banking on a wider scale here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":331,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development, issued a report on Local Public Banking in Ireland last year.

I would like to advise the Deputy that there are no property related tax incentives for investment funds.<\/p><p>Irish collective investment vehicles which are authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland are taxed under the gross roll-up regime.  This means that the investment undertaking is generally exempt from tax on the profits it earns on behalf of its unit holders.  The profits are allowed to grow on a tax free basis within the fund and are taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. Investment Undertaking Tax (&ldquo;IUT&rdquo;) is deducted at source by the investment undertaking and paid over to Revenue on behalf of the unitholder.  In general, IUT does not apply to non-resident investors provided the relevant declarations are in place with the investment undertaking.<\/p><p>Finance Act 2016 introduced the Irish Real Estate Funds (IREF)\u00a0regime in response to concerns raised regarding the use of certain collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish property.  The investors had been using the structures to minimise their exposure to Irish tax on Irish property transactions.  IREFs are collective investment undertakings where 25% or more of the value of their assets is derived from real estate in the State.  Unit holders in the Irish Real Estate Fund are subject to IREF withholding tax at a rate of 20% on payments made to them by the Irish Real Estate Fund.  As with IUT, the IREF withholding tax is deducted by the Irish Real Estate Fund and paid to Revenue on behalf of the unit holder.  Unlike IUT, non-resident unit holders are also subject to IREF withholding tax.  In some circumstances the non-resident can make a claim to Revenue that the IREF withholding tax can be reduced under the terms of a double taxation treaty.  However, if a unit holder in an Irish Real Estate Fund holds more than 10% of the assets of the Irish Real Estate Fund, any payment from the Irish Real Estate Fund will be regarded as from immovable property and the IREF withholding tax deducted can not be reduced.  This contrasts with the gross roll-up regime where non-residents are exempt from exit tax entirely.<\/p><p>For both the gross roll-up regime and the IREF regime certain categories of investors such as pensions schemes, companies carrying on life business and charities are exempt from IUT and IREF withholding tax provided the appropriate declarations are in place.  This exemption is provided for as these categories of investor are more generally tax exempt.<\/p><p>In addition to the above and in the context of the question asked by the Deputy it may be appropriate to include commentary on the Real Estate Investment Trusts (&ldquo;REITs&rdquo;) regime.  While REITs must be Plcs which are listed on the main exchange of an EEA Member State, the Central Bank of Ireland requires that they have an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (&ldquo;AIFMs&rdquo;).  REITs are used as collective investment vehicles to invest in Irish rental property assets.  While they are not generally, in tax terms, described as funds, they are collective investment vehicles which are subject to Central Bank regulation and supervision and therefore may be within the scope of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply to property investment via a corporate vehicle.  Subject to various conditions, REITs are exempt from tax in respect of their property rental business, subject to a requirement to distribute profits annually for taxation at the level of the investors.  This distribution is subject to Dividend Withholding Tax (&ldquo;DWT&rdquo;) at 20%.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's question on annual tax yields, I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to separately identify investment funds holding property or property related assets or holding shares and units in property or property related assets.  However, the aggregate amounts of taxes paid by entities of this type, including tax paid by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs), are provided under &lsquo;Financial &amp;amp; Insurance activities&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Revenue Net Receipts by Sector&rsquo; information available at link: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be interested to note that the amount of IREF withholding tax in 2018 was &euro;9m, while net Dividend Withholding Tax amounting to &euro;11.8m in 2017 and &euro;12.8m in 2018 was collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs.<\/p><p>I refer now to the Deputy's questions regarding the value of investments in property or property related assets located in Ireland held by investment funds, domiciled in both the State and abroad.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to identify the value of investments in property or property related assets held by investment funds domiciled in the State from the information filed with Revenue. <\/p><p>In respect of Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs), only partial information is available from the IREF tax returns filed with Revenue for the years 2017 and 2018.  In this regard, IREFs are required to file an IREF tax return only where they have a taxable event in a particular year and therefore not all IREFs will have made returns for these years.  IREFs, were required by regulation to file annual financial statements on or before 30 January 2019 with Revenue for accounting periods which ended during 2017 and accounting periods which ended on or before 30 June 2018.  The information contained on the financial statements is currently being reviewed and analysed by Revenue.  Once this analysis is completed, Revenue will be in a position to provide more detail on the value of Irish real estate held by IREFs.<\/p><p>Irish domiciled funds are all treated as &ldquo;investment undertakings&rdquo; under the TCA 1997.  Revenue collects annual financial statements from IREFs (being the Irish domiciled funds that had significant exposure to Irish property) but it does not collect the same data for non-domiciled investment funds.<\/p><p>A small number of non-domiciled funds may be indirectly investing in Irish property.  This matter is currently receiving attention in Revenue, and any Exchequer exposure is being kept under review.  Funds are described as non-domiciled in Ireland if they are administered here but subject to regulation by a regulator other than the Central Bank of Ireland, e.g. they are regulated in the UK.<\/p><p>Non-domiciled funds are, under the Tax Consolidation Act 1997, treated in the same manner as any other non-resident taxpayer when it comes to charges to tax in relation to Irish property.  While section 1035A and section 747G both provide that a non-domiciled fund will not be treated as having a taxable presence in Ireland by virtue of fund management services provided by an independent agent, they do not dis-apply the standard Irish property charging provisions (e.g. s.29 for CGT).  Therefore, if a non-domiciled fund has Irish property, or an interest in Irish property (for example through a shareholding in a non-resident Property Company), it will be subject to Irish tax on its profits or gains in the same way as any other non-resident, depending on the relevant double tax agreements that may be applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100065#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Investigations","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100065#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[23793\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100065#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of complaints made under section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009; the progress made on same; the conclusions of same; the status of complaints referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":340,"content":"<p>I am informed by NAMA that two complaints regarding potential breaches of Section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009 have been brought to their attention. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In relation to one of the alleged breaches, I am advised that NAMA has concluded its investigations and is satisfied that no breach has occurred.

Significant actions have already been taken on foot on the Roadmap including the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, amendments to Ireland&rsquo;s exit tax rules, and the\u00a0prompt ratification of the BEPS Multilateral Instrument.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Roadmap, further actions will be taken in Finance Bill 2019 including the amendment of Ireland&rsquo;s transfer pricing rules and the introduction of anti-hybrid rules.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a very open economy which serves as a key European base for a significant number of non-EU headquartered multinational companies, it is to be fully expected that Ireland would have a higher percentage of outbound royalty payments than other Member States.  Concerns about outbound payments are justified in circumstances where the relevant profits should in fact be taxed in the EU or where the profits are ultimately being untaxed (either in the recipient or parent jurisdiction).  It is my belief that neither of these concerns should arise in respect of outbound payments from Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The international consensus reached during the BEPS project is that profits should be taxed where the &lsquo;DEMPE&rsquo; functions occur.  To the extent where DEMPE functions occur within the EU, Member States have the ability to tax the profits attributable to those functions within their jurisdiction under the international corporation tax framework.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of the outbound payments made from Ireland are made by companies which are ultimately owned by companies resident and taxable in the United States.  It is my understanding that reforms introduced by the US in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 should make it impossible for any such royalties to avoid tax in the US even if they are not paid to the US directly and are not taxed in the recipient jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons I believe that the actions set out in the Roadmap are appropriate with regard to addressing aggressive tax planning but, as always, I will continue to keep the situation under review and shall act accordingly as circumstances demand.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to\u00a0addressing the challenges that have arisen from the digitalisation of the world economy and we will continue to contribute positively to the discussion at both EU and OECD level in pursuit of a stable, and globally agreed international tax framework which is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100066#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties Reliefs","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100066#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[24215\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100066#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be accrued if the excise duty exemption on aviation fuel was ended; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[24216\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100066#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated revenue that would be accrued if the excise duty exemption on aviation fuel was ended with an exception for domestic flights; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.<\/p><p>Ireland's excise duty treatment of fuel used for air navigation is based on European law as set out in Directive 2003\/96\/EC on the taxation of energy products and electricity, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive.  Under this Directive, Member States are obliged to exempt certain fuels used for commercial aviation purposes from excise duty.  The scope of this exemption must include jet fuel (which is the most commonly used heavy oil in air navigation) and must encompass such fuel used for intra-Community and international air transport purposes.  A Member State may waive this exemption where it has entered into a bilateral agreement with another Member State to tax fuel for intra-community flights.  With regard to fuel for international transport, the scope for a Member State to take a unilateral approach to taxation is limited by international law and a range of bilateral and multilateral agreements that operate under 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation (known as the Chicago Convention). <\/p><p>Member States may opt to exempt or partially exempt other fuels used for commercial air navigation from excise duty and may also opt to fully or partially exempt fuels used for domestic commercial aviation.<\/p><p>In line with Article 14 of the Energy Tax Directive, Ireland&rsquo;s Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) legislation, set out in Finance Act 1999, provides for jet fuel used for commercial aviation purposes to be exempted from excise duty.  This exemption covers both domestic and international commercial aviation. In addition, Finance Act 1999 provides for a partial relief from excise duty for light oil (aviation gasoline) used for commercial aviation.  Again, there is no distinction in national legislation between domestic and international commercial aviation in the operation of the partial relief.<\/p><p>The following table summarises the mandatory exemptions and excise duty measures for aviation fuels required under Article 14 of the Energy Tax Directive. It also summarises the MOT treatment of such fuels used for air navigation as set out in national legislation.<table><tr><th>Aviation Fuel\/Use<\/th><th>Energy Tax   Directive<\/th><th>Finance Act 1999<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for domestic\u00a0commercial aviation <\/td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to exempt\u00a0or partially exempt<\/td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres (section 97B Finance Act 1999)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for   intra-Community\/international commercial aviation<\/td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to   exempt or partially exempt<\/td><td>Partial relief from MOT, effective rate of &euro;355.44 per 1,000 litres    (section 97B Finance Act 1999)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Light oil (aviation gasoline) used for private\u00a0pleasure flying<\/td><td>Mandatory taxation<\/td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;587.71 per 1,000 litres (section 96   Finance Act 1999)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for domestic commercial aviation<\/td><td>No mandatory tax exemption, Member States may opt to   exempt or partially exempt<\/td><td>Full exemption<br \/><br \/>(section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for used for   intra-Community\/international commercial aviation<\/td><td>Mandatory tax exemption, except where bilateral\u00a0arrangement entered into with another Member State<\/td><td>Full exemption<br \/><br \/>(section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Heavy oil (jet fuel) used for private pleasure flying<\/td><td>Mandatory taxation<\/td><td>Full MOT rate of &euro;479.02 per 1,000 litres<br \/><br \/>(section 100(2)(b) Finance Act 1999)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>It is important to note that the tax exemption for heavy oil (jet fuel) used for air navigation for international and intra-Community transport purposes is mandatory, except where a bilateral arrangement to tax fuel for intra-community air navigation is entered into with another Member State.  This option has not been taken up by Member States to date as any such bilateral agreement would raise significant legal and competition issues in the event that aircraft operators registered in a non EU country also operated on a route between the Member States which were a party to the bilateral agreement.  As such, any material changes to the current tax regime would likely require a major revision of the Energy Tax Directive in order to deliver the necessary legal certainty and to ensure a level playing field between airline operators and between Member States.

Accordingly, for a public servant who retired after implementation of the FEMPI 2013 pay reductions (assuming he or she was affected by those reductions), his or her retirement pension and lump sum were calculated not on the basis of the lower salary rates in payment to serving employees at the date of his or her retirement but on the salary rates in payment on 1 January 2010.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6.2 of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020 (PSSA) committed the Government to adopting an equitable approach to various public service pensioner cohorts differentiated by date of retirement, in the context of the resumption of pay parity for the duration of the PSSA. <\/p>  <p>  Thus, for public servants retiring from 1 March 2012 onwards, to the extent that they retired on FEMPI reduced salaries when compared with public servants who retired from the same grade\/payscale point before that date, they will receive, for the duration of the PSSA, pension increases in line with the pay increases due to their peers currently in employment. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with normal public service pension arrangements, retirement lump sums are calculated on the rates of salary that a public servant is in receipt of at time of retirement (with the exception of the 'grace period' protection I have described above).

The review made a number of recommendations including the way SNA support is allocated to schools and the need to build school capacity through training.\u00a0<\/p><p>The NCSE concluded that a better model of support was required, one which provides the right support at the right time provided by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill sets.\u00a0 The review recommended a new school inclusion model where the response by the State to the additional care needs for students in our schools would be broadened and better tailored to individual needs.<\/p><p>On 27\u00a0March I announced the trialing of the School Inclusion Model in 75 schools for the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p><p>One feature of the School Inclusion Model is the development of a frontloaded allocation model of SNAs.\u00a0 Frontloading SNA support eliminates the need for an individual assessment for each student, ending the link with the requirement for a formal diagnosis to gain access to support, and will reduce the delays in making supports available to schools. The proposed arrangements when implemented will also improve job security for SNAs in schools ensuring greater certainty for SNAs in relation to their employment status.<\/p><p>In conducting their review, the NCSE consulted widely and consultation will continue to be a central feature of the development and implementation. \u00a0Over 50 people including SNAs and their representatives attended an information and consultation event on 30 April 2019. \u00a0Further consultation is being undertaken directly with the Forsa union.\u00a0<\/p><p>My\u00a0Department\u00a0published the Circular (number 71\/2011, see below) concerning Croke Park Hours for SNAs, however,\u00a0it does not get involved in the local management of how schools (as the employers) arrange the delivery of the hours from their staff (including SNAs).\u00a0 However, point 9 of Appendix 1 of this circular does provide possible examples (not exhaustive listing) of the type of work that maybe undertaken by SNA&rsquo;s to meet their Croke Park hourly obligations.<\/p><p>Link to DES Circular 71\/2011 is as follows:\u00a0<\/p><p>Where a full-time SNA post within a school is reduced to a part-time post, the issue of redundancy payment in respect of the loss of hours may arise.\u00a0 Redundancy arrangements for SNAs are set out in Department Circular 0058\/2006.<\/p><p>Where a school\/ETB has an additional allocation of SNA hours\/posts then that additional allocation of hours\/posts must be offered to an existing part-time SNAs in that school, in order of seniority, before the employer has recourse to these arrangements. This means that before an employer opts to recruit a further person as an SNA(s), they must ensure that all existing part-time SNAs in their employment, in order of seniority, have been offered a full-time position in the school or, in the case of ETBs, a full-time position in a school within the ETB scheme. The only exception that can be made to this rule is where a school\/ETB has a determination in writing from the NCSE \/ SENO stating that their allocation must be split amongst a specific number of SNAs and\/or stating that the allocation must be implemented in a specific fashion to address the care needs of the pupil(s). These arrangements are set out in Department Circular 0030\/2019 published on\u00a022 May 2019, which is available via the following link: https:\/\/www.education.ie\/en\/Circulars-and-Forms\/Active-Circulars\/cl0030_2019.pdf\u00a0<\/p><p>The position on working hours for SNAs is that there are no nationally set working hours for full-time SNAs. In this regard, the contractual position in respect of the working hours of SNAs is as outlined in their contracts of employment which were agreed with the school management authorities and the relevant Trade Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) prior to their introduction in 2005. The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc. The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools. No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc. These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total. Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days. These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the contract for Special Needs Assistants in the post primary sector (link below) specifically requires that SNAs are required to work the month of June on examinations and work appropriate to the grade including training. This was agreed with the Unions representing SNAs (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU) when the contract was devised in 2005. This condition of service places a clear onus and obligation on the SNA to attend at their place of work and be available for work during the month of June.<\/p><p>It is a matter for school management as their employer to determine the precise work that is to be completed by SNAs during the month of June. The utilisation of this period is not specifically for examinations or training purposes only, although these are two of the purposes for which the period of work can be utilised.\u00a0<\/p><p>Link to the SNA Contract of Employment for the Post Primary sector:<\/p><p>Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12\/05 (Post-Primary)\u00a0.<\/p><p>This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs including leave entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100072#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Training Places","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100072#WRP03800"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[24173\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100072#WRP03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps he will take in the case of a person (details supplied) who was refused access to a PME primary masters programme due to an insufficient level of Irish; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1345","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>Having relatively high minimum entry requirements in core subject areas of Irish, English and Mathematics is one of the key policy levers that help ensure quality teaching and learning in primary schools.\u00a0 The 2011 Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and subsequent review identified the need to raise standards of achievement and included decisions to raise the entry requirements in the core subjects over time. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2017, changes were announced setting higher minimum entry standards to primary programmes of initial teacher education for Leaving Certificate Maths, English and Irish, with the key change to take effect from September 2019.

An important initiative in that regard is the \"Greentown&rdquo; project, a research project led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL). The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with UL which is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also by my own Department.  Its specific focus is on examining the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt this. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks.  This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, during 2019. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, I am currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy with the assistance of an interdepartmental and interagency steering group.  The new Strategy will address the full range of issues relevant to youth justice, including how best to tackle the serious issues raised in the Deputy's Question.  <\/p>  <p>  A key issue here is how to ensure an integrated approach across all agencies, but in particular the relevant child welfare programmes, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and schools, to ensure a sustained and holistic response and that integrated services are provided to respond to the situation of children at risk, tailored to the individual child in the context of the specific family and the specific community and the issues they face.  The new Youth Justice Strategy will be published in draft form for a further round of public consultation before the end of this year and will be finalised early in 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs).  These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime\/anti-social behaviour.   <\/p>  <p>  For 2019, IYJS has a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community.  This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11.  The Department also supports pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as mentoring initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100073#WRQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":739,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100073#WRQ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":740,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[23230\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100073#WRQ04000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in the Meath division in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019.","asker":"1235","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":741,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

the data requested in respect of the categories of persons requested by the Deputy principally because not every applicant or person granted refugee status chooses to remain in the State either during their application process or subsequent to a grant of refugee status.\u00a0 For example, some applicants may leave the State without notifying\u00a0me and not continue with their\u00a0application. Others may decide not to cooperate with the process\u00a0(such as not returning their application questionnaires to the International Protection Office (IPO))\u00a0and therefore it is difficult to ascertain if they continue to reside in the State.\u00a0 Some applicants may formally withdraw their international protection application and either leave the State or else reside in the State under a different immigration permission type. Therefore, because an individual has applied for asylum and their application has yet to be finalised, this is not determinative of the number of international protection applicants actually residing in the State at any given time.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding, and to give some context to the number of asylum seekers and refugees that have applied for an international protection status, I can inform the Deputy that as of end May 2019 there are some\u00a08,116 persons who have made an international protection application or refugee status application whose application is ongoing. \u00a0Many of these are under active consideration either at first instance or appeal while others maybe the subject of judicial review, etc.\u00a0 Included in this number are approximately 1,200 protection applicants\u00a0who are considered not to be cooperating, for example, not having returned their international protection questionnaire or provided a valid address. <\/p><p>With regard to persons granted refugee status, I can inform the Deputy that a total of 5,449 persons have received an international protection declaration (refugee status or subsidiary\u00a0protection status) since 2008 to the end of May 2019. In addition, a total of 1,307 programme refugees have arrived in the State under the UNHCR-led Refugee Resettlement strand of the IRPP (Irish Refugee Protection Programme), making a total of 6,756 persons who have been issued either a refugee or subsidiary protection status in the State during the period. \u00a0It is not possible to say how many of those granted status are currently in the State.\u00a0 For example, some may have left the State voluntarily and it is expected that a significant number have gone on to become naturalised Irish citizens or have attained an alternative immigration permission.\u00a0 <\/p><p>With regards to the age profile of those seeking international protection, for the reasons outlined, it is not possible to provide such figures for those resident in the State.\u00a0 However, the following tables provide a breakdown of those currently at first instance stage (which is considered representative of the wider population) together with a breakdown of persons granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status for the period requested by the Deputy. \u00a0<\/p><p><b>Table 1:<\/b><b>Age breakdown &ndash; Asylum\/International Protection Cases Pending in the International Protection Office for first instance recommendation decision on\u00a031\/05\/2019<\/b><table><tr><th>Age    Profile<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Minors (0-17 years)<\/td><td>1,103<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Adults (18 and upwards)<\/td><td>4,626<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>5729<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>Table 2: Age breakdown &ndash; Persons granted a protection status (refugee or subsidiary protection status) since 2008. <\/b><table><tr><th>Age Profile<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Age Profile<\/td><td>Total<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Minors (0-17 years)<\/td><td>2,305<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Adults (18 and upwards)<\/td><td>4,451<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>6,756<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100074#WRR04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":797,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100075#WRS00200"},{"type":"question","counter":798,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[23363\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100075#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the timeline and status of the commencement of section 212 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":799,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[23376\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100075#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the scheduled date for the commencement of operations by the legal practitioners' tribunal in accordance with the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":800,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 323 together.<\/p>  <p>  The regulatory reform of the legal services sector has been taking place since the enactment of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and the establishment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, which is independent in the performance of its functions, on 1 October 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  The Legal Service Regulatory Authority's forthcoming actions are set out in its Strategic Plan for 2018-2020 which was duly laid before the Houses and under which the Authority is set to come into substantial operational mode from the middle of this year. <\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Act provides for the introduction of an independent complaints and professional conduct regime for legal practitioners including the separate establishment and appointment of an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. The new Tribunal will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers and will replace the existing bodies which currently operate for that purpose and will be winding-down their existing caseloads. Extensive preparations have been on-going at the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to put the necessary procedural, staffing, IT and other supports in place with the intention of being in a position to receive and process public complaints from early October 2019. At that point, members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the Authority and the new Disciplinary Tribunal will come into operation in its own right. <\/p>  <p>  Section 212 of the 2015 Act, provides that a barrister in employment whose name is entered on the Roll of Practising Barristers may provide legal services to his or her employer, including by appearing on behalf of that employer in a court, tribunal or forum for arbitration. Given that the Roll of Practising Barristers has now been established by the Authority it is also anticipated that section 212 will be commenced to coincide with the coming into operation of the public complaints and professional conduct regime of Part 6 of the 2015 Act later this year. <\/p>  <p>  This Autumn will also see the introduction of the new legal costs transparency regime set out in Part 10 of the 2015 Act including, separately, the transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators which will maintain a publicly accessible Register of its legal costs determinations. Similarly, the roll-out of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships is anticipated. The new professional conduct regime being introduced under Part 6 will, therefore, underpin the new legal costs and other obligations that will apply to legal practitioners being regulated under the 2015 Act. As Minister I will, of course, continue to support the roll-out of these various functions with the timely commencement of the relevant provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100075#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100075#WRS00600"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[23364\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100075#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; in the Donegal division; the number of garda&iacute; based in the division in each of the years 2011 to 2018; the number of new recruits placed in the division between 2017 and to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

The report is structured around these types of costs, providing accounts of the investigations into the methodologies in each of these fields found in the relevant literature. <\/p>  <p>  The EIGE report concluded that\u00a0its detailed case study\u00a0would\u00a0not be easy to replicate in other countries as\u00a0the data requirements are high.\u00a0To illustrate the difficulties involved, a Council of Europe Study examined a range of estimates\u00a0of the cost of\u00a0gender-based violence.\u00a0Depending on data and methods used, the lowest cost\u00a0estimate was just 1.6% of the highest cost estimate, rendering any estimation meaningless in the context of such a broad divergence.\u00a0I am informed that EIGE concluded that there is currently insufficient available data to robustly cost the impact of intimate partner violence separately for each EU-28 Member State.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with various EIGE meetings in relation to administrative data on gender-based violence and will continue to do so as practice develops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100076#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":860,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100076#WRT01700"},{"type":"question","counter":861,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[23661\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100076#WRT01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of offences committed by perpetrators of all ages while on bail in each of the past five years to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":862,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to this matter, and I will contact the Deputy directly\u00a0once\u00a0the information is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100076#WRT01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Status","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100076#WRT02000"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[23678\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100076#WRT02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has the power to revoke the refugee status of a person if the person engages in serious criminal behaviour and has been convicted of certain offences before the courts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>I wish to\u00a0advise the Deputy that\u00a0the power to revoke a declaration of refugee status is dependent on the specific provisions of the legislation under which the status was initially granted.<\/p><p>Where refugee status was granted under the former Refugee Act 1996, status may be revoked in accordance with Section 21(1)(g)of that Act where the persons presence in the State poses a threat to national security or public policy. <\/p><p>The law has been strengthened somewhat in this area since the introduction of the International Protection Act 2015.

This must have been deeply distressing to all involved and I offer my unreserved apology for the breakdown in communication, which led to this unintended event. <\/p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) supported the organisation of a memorial for the person concerned, which was held shortly after her passing and was attended by her friends, centre management and members of staff from RIA.  I have written to her friends with the offer of assistance to organise an appropriate commemoration following her burial.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, where a person dies while she or he is being provided with accommodation by RIA, RIA works closely with the centre manager to assist the family in accessing the supports provided by the State, and to ensure that any residents affected by the death are assisted in accessing services that can support them.  All deaths and serious incidents that occur within accommodation centres provided by the Department are referred to the Garda&iacute; as a matter of course and the Garda&iacute; in turn refer all deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office.  As is the case with all Garda&iacute;\/coroner matters, RIA is not privy to information held by the Garda&iacute; or by a coroner. <\/p>  <p>  The decision on whether to hold an inquest into the death of any person reported to the coroner, is a matter for the coroner who is independent in the conduct of their functions under the Coroners Act 1962.  I am informed by the relevant coroner in this case that an inquest will not be required as the post-mortem examination disclosed that death was due to natural causes.  The coroner, as required by law, provided details to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office to register the death.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to better understand the communications between all parties concerned, a senior Departmental official spoke to the Coroner on 7th June 2019.  The Coroner pointed out that the normal practice, where someone is interested in the outcome of a coroner&rsquo;s consideration of whether an inquest will be held into the death of a person is necessary or when a person&rsquo;s remains are to be released for burial, is that a letter would be on file.  However as there was no formal request made in writing to record an interest in the release of the deceased's remains, he arranged for the appropriate and dignified burial of the deceased, through the relevant State agencies, as is the standard practice in these cases.<\/p>  <p>   While thankfully, the occurrences of deaths where the deceased remains unidentified, unclaimed or no next of kin is identified, are very rare, the Department will take all possible steps to ensure that this outcome is avoided in future and that friends or colleagues who have expressed an interest are properly informed through appropriate communications with the coronial service and by liaising with other agencies involved in this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100077#WRU04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Subsidiary Protection Applications","counter":936,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100078#WRV00500"},{"type":"question","counter":937,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[24231\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100078#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the attention of the relevant section has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); and if all relevant information has been received.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":938,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, if an application for asylum or subsidiary protection has been made in the State, for confidentiality reasons it is not the practice to comment on such applications or to provide comment on what stage such applications are at in the administrative process.

Public-interest entities are systemically important entities such as credit institutions and insurance undertakings.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  <\/p>  <p>  Only where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and wider EEA, may an employment permit be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.  The Employment Permits legislation prescribes a range of criteria when considering an application for an employment permit including a Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT).  The LMNT seeks to ensure that an offer of employment is first made to people already in the local and EEA labour markets before an application is made for an employment permit to employ a non-EEA national.  The Employment Permits Act 2014 prescribed the criteria to which employers must adhere in order to satisfy the LMNT and includes the provision that employers must advertise in National Newspapers. <\/p>  <p>  An examination of the operation of the Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT) was included in the Review of Economic Migration Policy which was published at the end of last year.  The Report found there is widespread support for retention of the LMNT, however it recommended modernisation and extension of the process by broadening the range of advertising methods to reflect modern advertising tools.  This will be addressed in new Employment Permit legislation which is being developed to consolidate the existing Employment Permit Acts and to implement the recommendations of the Review.  A consultation with stakeholders will be undertaken as the draft legislation is being developed.<\/p>  <p>  The highly skilled and ineligible occupations lists for employment permit purposes are subject to regular review to ensure the regime is aligned with prevailing labour market conditions.  The twice yearly review process examines labour market conditions at occupational level and adjusts access to the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals on the basis of available evidence.  In addition to public submissions, the review process involves the in-depth examination of research and data from sources such as SOLAS, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), review of relevant Reports, outputs and initiatives and input from Government Departments.  Submissions received are also considered by the Economic Migration Policy Interdepartmental Group chaired by DBEI.<\/p>  <p>  In order to have the status of an occupation changed to make it eligible for employment permits, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages of appropriate personnel across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and\/or employment conditions.

I have long since recognised the need for clear policy in this area, particularly with regard to the sector over which I have responsibility.  This is why I sought Government approval in December 2017 to the development of an adult safeguarding policy for the health sector, together with underpinning legislation as required.  This will be the first such overarching policy for the health sector.  My Department's ongoing work in this area addresses the Government's Decision to approve this proposal.  An overarching sectoral policy of this nature is a complex undertaking, not least because the health sectoral policy will cover the public, voluntary and private sector and will include cooperation, collaboration, information-sharing and referral arrangements between the health and social care sector and other relevant sectors.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has established an inter-agency steering group to assist with the development of the health sector adult safeguarding policy.  This group contains representation from relevant public sector bodies and a citizen representative.  A number of representatives on the inter-agency steering group are also represent their organisations on Safeguarding Ireland (SI) - for example, five of SI's member organisations and two of its individual members overlap with the membership of the steering group. <\/p>  <p>  Comprehensive stakeholder consultation, including with Safeguarding Ireland, has been and will be a feature of my Department&rsquo;s development of a national health sectoral policy on adult safeguarding.  A major stakeholder consultation event is planned for Autumn and a public consultation is planned in relation to a draft policy.  As a key stakeholder, Safeguarding Ireland will be invited to participate in both of these consultation processes.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that adult safeguarding is a matter for every sector, including the health and social care sector.  I am not aware of specific plans that other Departments may have in relation to their sectoral responsibilities in this area, nor am I aware of any plans to establish an all of Government group.  As noted, my Department's focus is on delivering a comprehensive health sector policy and, subsequently, any required legislation to underpin it. <\/p>  <p>  The level of funding available to my Department and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE, including in relation to its adult safeguarding functions, will be considered as part of the normal Estimates and budgetary process and the national service planning process.  As an operational matter, I am referring the PQ to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy in relation to the specific resources allocated within the HSE to its National Safeguarding Office and each of its Safeguarding and Protection Teams for the years 2015 to 2019. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that funding support is provided to Safeguarding Ireland from the HSE&rsquo;s allocation from the Health Vote.  As an additional support, the HSE provides a secretariat service to Safeguarding Ireland.  I do not have details on the support provided by other Departments or Agencies to Safeguarding Ireland, I am therefore referring the PQ to the HSE for direct reply to Deputy, as the HSE in providing secretariat support to Safeguarding Ireland can provide details in relation to the level and source of resources provided to Safeguarding Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100079#WRW03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Administration","counter":1009,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100079#WRW03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1010,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[24253\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100079#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are insurance liability risks for recipients of home care supports if a care giver alleges he or she was injured on the property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1011,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[24254\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100079#WRW03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if HSE-employed home carers and-or privately employed home carers are covered for injuries sustained while they are at the homes of their clients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[24247\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100079#WRW03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are insurance liability risks for recipients of home care supports if a care giver alleges he or she was injured on the property; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1013,"qnumday":707,"qnumall":"[24248\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100079#WRW03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if HSE-employed home carers and-or privately employed home carers are covered for injuries sustained while they are at the homes of their clients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In this regard, the Government is committed to improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures.<\/p><p>The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan places a strong focus on ten high-volume Inpatient\/Day Case procedures. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.<\/p><p>A key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p><p>The plan includes a target to reduce the number of patients waiting for and Inpatient\/Day Case procedure from just over 70,000 in December 2018 to 60,000 by year end and to reduce the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. The latter target takes into account the fact that more than 800,000 new patients will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019, a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. <\/p><p>The NTPF advise that over recent months they have placed a particular focus on engaging with hospital groups and individual hospitals to identify outpatient waiting list proposals. While the NTPF have already approved over 38,000 outpatient appointments, they advise that the impact of these initiatives may not be seen until the end of the year. Approximately 75% of outpatient appointments approved to date relate to 4 high-volume specialities, specifically Ophthalmology, ENT, Orthopaedics, and Dermatology. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department is working with the HSE and NTPF, under the Access Plan, with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.<\/p><p>Navan Hospital IPDC waiting list has increased by 12% (+71) when compared to the same period last year but has decreased by 19% (-162) when compared to August 2018. Navan Hospital Outpatient waiting list has increased by 20% (+1,196) when compared to the same period last year.<\/p><p>*Due to the small volume of patients waiting in timebands over 12 months on the IPDC waiting list, and over 24 months on the Outpatient waiting list, to preserve patient confidentiality, these numbers have been included within the broader timebands of 12+ months and 24+ months

It seeks to deliver on the Future of Healthcare Committee&rsquo;s vision of a health system in which care is provided in the right place, at the right time, by the right person and is always provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay with a priority focus on developing primary and community services within a national policy context. <\/p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is about delivering a health and social care service that meets the needs of our population and attracts and retains the very best healthcare professionals, managers and staff.<\/p>  <p>  With appropriate, well-governed investment, we will deliver a service that is given by the right team at low or no charge. Crucially, engaging with staff, staff representative bodies and the wider stakeholder network, to find new ways of working to deliver expanded services, will be essential to optimise the wealth of skills and knowledge inherent in our health workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  A detailed Sl&aacute;intecare Action plan for 2019 was completed and published on March 13   2019.

These intervals are based on best international evidence. <\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, lab turnaround times for smear test results increased significantly during 2018 as a result of both out of cycle smears and greater uptake generally. However, the programme is now back to normal call-recall procedures and lab turnaround times are improving. While they can be as long as 30 weeks, two out of three labs are now returning results in eight weeks or less.  <\/p>  <p>  While a backlog of around 80,000 smears had built up, this has now begun to fall and was reported by the HSE to be down to around 54,474 by the 9th of June. <\/p>  <p>  Since the 1st of May, the third laboratory, which has the largest backlog, has ceased accepting new slides and is focused on clearing its backlog. I am pleased to say that the HSE has now agreed a deal with Quest Diagnostics to provide the additional capacity necessary to ensure the continuation of the national cervical screening programme. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to say also that the HSE has advised that the natural history of cervical cancer would indicate that the disease would normally develop over a period of 10 to 15 years. It has said that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, poses a very low risk to women. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the correspondence forwarded by the Deputy, it is my understanding that the same correspondence was sent to CervicalCheck on 21st May 2019, who responded directly to the individual, copying the Deputy, on 22nd May.   <\/p>  <p>  The individual concerned opted to have her screening test taken in October 2018 processed as a private smear test with MedLab.  CervicalCheck is a government funded public programme and there is no provision  to  hold  information  (i.e. results or  otherwise)  pertaining  to  private smears.  These are considered non programme smears. The most up to date record relating to this individual is that the last screening test with the programme was in February 2016 and that they would be called in 3 years  for a repeat test. CervicalCheck then sent a letter dated 27.03.2019 as a follow on from the recommendation of this person's 2016 screening test.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100087#WREE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1372,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100087#WREE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1373,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[23653\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100087#WREE02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1374,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

questions appear to relate to details of, and the handling of, a protected disclosure submitted to my Department in September 2014.<\/p>  <p>  A protected disclosure, raising matters of concern within the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), was received by my Department in September 2014.  The matters complained of included the impact of certain conduct on the health and well-being of personnel and procurement irregularities in the NMBI.  I am advised that the initial complaint did not characterise the matters as falling within the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The matter was referred to the Board of the NMBI to investigate in September 2014. In late September 2014 senior officials of my Department met with the President, Vice-President and another Board member and stated that it was important that a prompt, impartial and proportionate investigation must take place. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2014 my officials received a response from the Board of the NMBI in which the Board reported that it had formed the view that there appeared to be no foundation to the matters raised in the protected disclosure.  In order to be satisfied that the matter had been appropriately reviewed and an evidence based conclusion reached, officials from my Department requested the NMBI to set out the basis upon which it had arrived at this conclusion together with all evidence and documentation that had been relied upon.  The NMBI responded to say it was of the view that it was not appropriate to forward the material associated with the investigation.  My officials wrote again on this matter in December and, in the absence of receiving such assurances, the Secretary General of my Department wrote to the NMBI in January 2015.  The Secretary General conveyed the Department's continuing concerns that the NMBI had not provided evidence to satisfy the Department that the allegations had been investigated in an objective and transparent manner and set out the Department's strong view that the NMBI should appoint a third party with appropriate expertise and experience to carry out a review of the complaint.  <\/p>  <p>  In February 2015 the Board of the NMBI informed my Department that a third party had been appointed to carry out a preliminary external review of the complaint. My Department acknowledged this correspondence and stated that it looked forward to the outcome of the review. The review was completed in May 2015 and the Board of the NMBI informed my Department of the recommendations contained in the review in May 2015. In transmitting the recommendations to my Department by letter, the President of the NMBI copied a Board member and the CEO of the NMBI. My Department was not furnished with a copy of the review itself and is not familiar with the methodology adopted in the completion of the review or, for example, the manner in which interviews were conducted or the specific individuals who participated in the exercise.  Subsequently, in submitting a report to my officials in May 2016, the NMBI advised that the nature of some of the disclosures focused on what would generally be termed Human Resources related issues and the investigation of these was compounded by the departure of a former staff member.  I understand that the review conducted by the third party was shared with the person that was the subject of the complaint prior to the recommendations of the report being shared with my Department.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of that review, two reports were commissioned.  Crowe Horwath was engaged to carry out an Organisational Review and BDO was engaged to carry out a review of Remuneration and Contract Management of Non-Permanent Employees. BDO submitted two reports, the first in September and the second in November 2015. Crowe Horwath submitted a report in November 2015. The reports were accepted in full by the Board of the NMBI and they began to implement the recommendations.  This has resulted in a comprehensive change to the governance arrangements in the NMBI.  I can inform the Deputy that my Department was advised by the NMBI on 25 August 2015 that it did not intend to pursue the recommendation relating to an electronic record. However, I can advise the Deputy that my Department was subsequently (May 2016) advised of the steps that the NMBI took in respect of this specific recommendation.  The NMBI purchased specific software to enable electronic searching by key words and identified a number of documents for review.  This review took place and the complainant was advised of its outcome.  The NMBI further advised my Department that it was reviewing and updating its policies and practices in relation to NMBI provided technology and resources. <\/p>  <p>  The Board of the NMBI submitted a final report to my Department in May 2016 advising that the complaints raised in the Protected Disclosure had been upheld by the Board. The Board thanked the complainant for bringing these matters to its attention and stated that it had learned lessons. The Board set out a number of actions it had commenced to address the matters raised to ensure that similar situations will not arise again. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the complainant wrote to officials in my Department in February 2016 to outline their dissatisfaction with a number of matters in relation to the handling of their complaint. Included in this letter was a statement alleging that a person had sought to encourage the complainant to withdraw an element of their complaint.  I can further advise the Deputy that officials in my Department are aware that the complainant made a complaint to the Ombudsman regarding the conduct of the investigation.  <\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned an independent review to examine the Department&rsquo;s handling of the protected disclosure. This review found that the Department had acted appropriately at all times, albeit I am aware based upon subsequent engagement between my officials and the complainant that the complainant does not accept the findings of this review. <\/p>  <p>  In view of the reports commissioned, the findings of same, and the steps taken by the NMBI to implement the recommendations of the reports, I am satisfied that significant action has been taken on foot of the complaints made.  These complaints were an important input to the enhancement of governance in the NMBI. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware of and has raised the obligations set out in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which provide that a person who receives a protected disclosure in the course of their duties shall not disclose information that might identify the person making the disclosure. Given that the matters referred to by the Deputy relate to a relatively small organisation, I am conscious that to discuss them in great detail may run a risk of inadvertently revealing information that could identify the discloser.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the payment of legal fees, reference to such payment is included in correspondence from the complainant to my Department. My Department has requested that the NMBI provide the Deputy with information as to whether such payment was made and, if so, the reasons. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy has asked what responsibility I have for matters in the NMBI as Minister in the context of the Nurses and Midwives Act, 2011. I can advise the Deputy that the Act conveys certain powers on me as Minister.  For example, section 9 provides that I may require the NMBI to provide me with information in relation to the performance of its functions and section 11 provides that I may give general policy directions to the Board. The NMBI is an independent statutory body.  Its Board is made up of 23 people, some of whom are elected by registered members of the nursing and midwifery profession, some nominated by prescribed bodies and some appointed by the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100089#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Abortion Services Provision","counter":1481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100090#WRHH00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1482,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[23871\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100090#WRHH00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical and surgical abortions that have been provided by the HSE to date in 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1483,"content":"<p>Under section 20 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, a notification of each termination of pregnancy carried out under the legislation must be notified to the Minister for Health within 28 days of it being carried out.  <\/p><p>The Minister must prepare a report on the notifications received in a given year not later than 30 June the following year, and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

Lyme disease is a notifiable disease in Ireland since 2012.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies to <i>Borrelia burgdorferi <\/i>produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  <\/p><p>Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the standard approach to Lyme diagnostics which is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other spirochaete infections including syphilis, and certain viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results. <\/p><p>Testing which is performed abroad may be performed in laboratories which have not met National or International Accreditation (Quality Standards).  These tests may be more likely to give a &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; result.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.<\/p><p>If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) Service of Public Health England Porton which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  All clinical (and other) laboratories must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  This two tier approach gives a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.  All testing in Ireland is confirmed by the RIPL. <\/p><p>Lyme disease is a well-recognised infection, which is familiar to GPs and hospital specialists (especially those specialising in Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Dermatology Cardiology and Microbiology).  Accordingly, such specialists would be very familiar with how to manage such patients, and as a result, all physicians deal with Lyme disease, as they would with any other infectious disease for which they have responsibility.  As testing and treatment for Lyme borelliosis is widely available in all major hospitals in Ireland there is no need for people to travel to other EU Member States for diagnosis or treatment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100094#WRNN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Counselling Services Provision","counter":1635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100094#WRNN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1636,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[24036\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100094#WRNN03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in each LHO area waiting for a counselling appointment in primary care at the end of May 2019 or the latest date available;

They work in partnership with public bodies, service providers, the Garda&iacute; and the local community. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health provides in the region of &euro;28 million to task forces annually. <\/p>  <p>  In March 2019, I announced additional funding of &euro;1 million for the implementation of Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery. This funding, which will be provided on a recurring, multi-annual basis, will address the priorities set down in the strategy including responses to emerging trends in substance misuse, and improving services for groups with complex needs. <\/p>  <p>  I strongly support the efforts of the my colleague, the Minister for Justice, the Garda&iacute; and other law enforcement authorities to prevent, disrupt and reduce the drug-related activities of criminal groups. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100095#WROO04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"question","counter":1688,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[24141\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100095#WROO04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional funding being allocated to task forces in 2019 for each local and regional drugs and alcohol task force, in tabular form; the purpose of the additional funding; if this is one-off funding; if it is proposed to become core annual funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1689,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[24142\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100095#WROO04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding being allocated as core funding to each local and regional drugs and alcohol task force for 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1690,"qnumday":671,"qnumall":"[24143\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100095#WROO04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if further funding is to be allocated to drugs and alcohol local and regional task forces; the purpose and amount of additional funding; the timing and criteria for its allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1691,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 669 to 671, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Drug and Alcohol Task Forces will be allocated in the region of &euro;28 million in funding for 2019.

Budget 2019 announced that the Government has further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. <\/p><p>The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan will\u00a0place a strong focus on\u00a0a number of\u00a0high-volume procedures. When combined with HSE activity, it is projected that the NTPF will be in a position to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months for one of these high-volume procedures.<\/p><p>A\u00a0key element of the Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List.\u00a0Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. Under the plan the NTPF will use &euro;6 million to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p><p>The plan includes\u00a0a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. <\/p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures.

While Member States will be invited to give an opinion on the draft Regulation through the Commission&rsquo;s Common Market Organisation Management Committee, the draft Regulation is within the Commission&rsquo;s own legal competence, and is not for negotiation with Ireland or indeed other Member States, in terms of its content.<\/p>  <p>  Further details on the aid package\u00a0will be announced in due course following the appropriate stakeholder consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":1891,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Ireland","counter":1890,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1891,"qnumday":750,"qnumall":"[24191\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the details of the Inland Fisheries Ireland-OPW instream enhancement programme for 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1333","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1892,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is the statutory body responsible for Drainage Maintenance and Flood Risk Management in the State while Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is the statutory body responsible for the protection and conservation of the inland fisheries resource.<\/p>  <p>  IFI and OPW signed a shared service agreement in July 2018 which will see continued collaboration over the five year period 2018-2022 in the protection of fishery requirements while flood risk management investment activities are being undertaken by OPW. The agreement involves both parties working closely together to help ensure the country&rsquo;s statutory drainage objectives are achieved with an appropriate focus on the protection of fishery habitats and resources.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement has been secured at a time when Government investment in flood risk management operations is significant and follows the recent publication of the Government&rsquo;s Flood Risk Management Plans. This new partnership formalises the historical working relationship between the two organisations and commits them to continuing their positive engagement for the benefit of Ireland&rsquo;s fishery habitats and resources.<\/p>  <p>  Under the agreement, both parties will work across the Environmental River Enhancement Programme (EREP) and will focus on:<\/p>  <p>  - A series of scientific investigations to further understand environmental impacts of river maintenance works.<\/p>  <p>  - Development of best practice to minimise environmental impacts and maximise environmental gain of river maintenance and flood relief activities.<\/p>  <p>  - Work programme to identify barriers to fish passage on arterially drained rivers that have potential for improvements works.<\/p>  <p>  - Work elements to assist in all waters attaining &lsquo;Good&rsquo; ecological status by a specified date, as per the EU<\/p>  <p>  - Water Framework Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The full agreement is available on the IFI website www.fisheriesireland.ie and includes, inter alia, the provision of dedicated staff within IFI, the agreed need to generate fish and hydro-morphology Environment Quality Ratio scores in advance of any proposed works to identify actual need for works and to specify works, if required, that would be appropriate to the hydro-morphological character of the channel. This is particularly relevant to any IFI or local community initiatives regarding instream and riparian works. <\/p>  <p>  IFI and OPW have agreed that the matching of enhancement measures to the relevant channel is to be undertaken in a holistic manner, and must be dependent on the character and needs of the catchment and on the channel&rsquo;s hydro-morphological characteristics. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is driven by the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive, particularly that the status of all water bodies should be at least &ldquo;Good&rdquo;. Overall status is assessed by a series of ecological indicators e.g. fish community and by habitat or hydro-morphology status. River enhancement, within the requirements of the Directive, goes beyond a narrow fisheries enhancement focus. The emphasis is on restoration of natural river processes and this type of approach should also broadly benefit fisheries. <\/p>  <p>  The EREP is undertaken by IFI and is an applied scientific study. OPW maintain approximately 2,000 km of channel each year and uses environmental guidance developed with IFI. The guidance is aimed at conservation and\/or adding value for habitat creation and river enhancement.<\/p>  <p>  A significant outcome from the Water Framework Directive and its impact on EREP is that OPW and IFI have agreed that any proposed 'enhancement' measure should be tested in advance to assess current status of fish and habitat. Four such enhancement proposals are to be so tested in 2019 with surveys of fish and habitat status scheduled. <\/p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the 2017 annual report of EREP is available online on both OPW and IFI websites. The draft 2018 report is currently being jointly reviewed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1260"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Pollution","counter":1893,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1894,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[24290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the dangers of air pollution from sources such as exhaust emissions, soil and road surfaces, construction work and industrial emissions; the number of premature deaths to date in 2019 that are directly attributable to poor air quality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1895,"qnumday":779,"qnumall":"[24288\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT04900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of air pollution breaches recorded at monitoring stations nationally to date in 2019; the locations in which air pollution readings breached the standard safe reading level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1896,"qnumday":780,"qnumall":"[24289\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100100#WRTT05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when the national ban on harmful smoky coal will come into force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1897,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 751, 779 and 780 together. <\/p><p>Recent scientific evidence indicates that air pollution is more damaging at lower concentrations than was previously understood. Air pollution also arises from a wide range of sources, including residential heating, transport and agriculture. With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy. The Strategy, which I intend to publish later this year, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives. <\/p><p>The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or &lsquo;the smoky coal ban&rsquo; as it is commonly known, has proven very successful since first introduced in Dublin in 1990 and subsequently extended so that it now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. <\/p><p>I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated they would legally challenge the decision of two former Ministers to extend the ban nationwide. As a result it has not proven possible to extend the ban nationwide for the 2019\/2020 year. The coal companies have indicated that if the smoky coal ban is extended, they will challenge both the new ban and the existing ban, on the basis that the state should also have to ban the burning of other fossil fuels, including wood and peat products. I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. <\/p><p>Estimates of the numbers of deaths attributable to air pollution in 41 European countries are released on an annual basis by the European Environment Agency. This assessment requires information on air pollution, demographic data, and the relationship between exposure to ambient pollutant concentrations and a health outcome. Figures for 2019 are not yet available. The latest report, published in 2018, gives data for 2015 and is available at the following link:<\/p><p>It indicates that there were in the order of 1,150 premature deaths in Ireland attributable to air pollution in 2015.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of air pollution breaches so far in 2019, ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the 2008 Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (Directive 2008\/50\/EC), and the Fourth Daughter Directive (Directive 2004\/107\/EC of 15 December 2004). These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality. <\/p><p>Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to expand and enhance the air quality monitoring network. The roll-out of the enhanced network, the Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), is progressing and over the period 2017 to 2022 will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. <\/p><p>Regarding the number of breaches recorded this year, provisional data from the EPA, which is subject to further validation, indicates that up until 6 June, there have been 98 breaches of the PM10 daily limit value during 2019 at stations as outlined in the table. Under the provisions of the CAFE Directive, an exceedance for PM10 is recorded if the limit is breached more than 35 times at an individual monitoring station during the year. <\/p><p>Number of values greater than 50 ug\/m3 <table><tr><th>Station Name<\/th><th>Year to date 06\/06\/2019<\/th><th>Station Location<\/th><th>Station Type<\/th><th>Station Operator<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>Dublin 10<\/td><td>Suburban Background<\/td><td>Dublin City Council<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>Dublin 15<\/td><td>Suburban Traffic<\/td><td>Fingal County Council<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brownes Road<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>Waterford City<\/td><td>Suburban Background<\/td><td>EPA<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>Co.

The Plan will set out how this Government intends to make Ireland climate resilient across our entire society. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action. The goals and targets will be informed by analysis of the most cost-effective choices available to reach our 2030 targets. By articulating a decarbonisation ambition range for each sector, the framework provided by the Plan will enable each sector to identify and put in place the most appropriate policy tools to deliver this stated ambition in order for Ireland to meet its 2030 targets. I intend that the Plan will be published shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406\/2009\/EC (ESD), which put in place binding annual emissions targets for each year between 2013 and 2020 for sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System, Ireland must achieve a reduction of 20% relative to 2005 levels of emissions. Under the latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published earlier this month by the EPA, emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could remain at between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The ESD allows Member States to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has already acquired a portion of the additional allowances that will be required for compliance. However, I am advised that Ireland will need to purchase additional allowances to meet projected shortfalls in 2019 and 2020. Under the ESD framework, compliance for any given year is calculated up to 18 months after the year in question. Therefore, the final budgetary impact of the cost of allowance purchases in respect of any ESD compliance shortfalls in 2019 and 2020 may not arise until 2021 or 2022. My Department currently estimates the cost of this requirement to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012) included investments in three multilateral funds, as well as a number of transactions for the purchase of carbon credits directly from the market. Through the direct market purchases and investment in the three funds, a total of &euro;120 million was spent, in which 8,558,888 credits were received by the State. Of this total, 3,052,416 have been surrendered for compliance with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The remaining number of carbon credits currently held by the State is 5,506,472, which may be used for ESD compliance. <\/p>  <p>  The latest emissions projections indicate that Ireland could exceed its cumulative annual greenhouse gas emissions ceilings for the 2021 to 2030 period under the EU Effort Sharing Regulation, by between 59 and 75 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent under different scenarios of policy implementation and assuming full utilisation of the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry mitigation option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100102#WRVV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Industry Data","counter":1961,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100102#WRVV01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1962,"qnumday":775,"qnumall":"[23797\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100102#WRVV02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of licences he and-or his predecessors have issued to domestic and international companies in respect of oil and-or gas exploration in all State territories in the past 50 years to date; the location of the explorations; the results of same; if the State has incurred costs as a result of same and-or has had to provide assistance for remedy or repair of territory; the number of existing applications for gas and-or oil exploration licences that have yet to be approved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1963,"content":"<p>Section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 requires the Minister to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas every six months a report detailing all exploration activities including petroleum exploration authorisations granted during the period of the report.

The National Policy Position outlined a national target of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors. The National Mitigation Plan, published in 2017, set Ireland on a pathway towards achieving the 2050 decarbonisation target.  The Plan included over 100 emissions-reducing actions that were underway or planned, including a range of transport measures, and it set out the potential emissions impact and the estimated costs of many of the actions.  The National Mitigation Plan initiated the process of developing medium to long term mitigation choices for the next and future decades.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment is now at an advanced stage in preparing a follow-on plan that will map out a whole-of-Government approach to Climate Action and meeting Ireland's emissions commitments.  My Department is working closely with his Department and across Government to ensure that the transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland overall carbon emissions (and about 27% of Ireland's accountable emissions in the non-ETS (emissions trading scheme) area), plays a key role in the overall Government approach to tackling climate commitments.  My Department has worked hard to develop an ambitious, challenging and wide-ranging set of actions, particularly for public transport and active travel.  The new Plan will be considered by Government shortly and then published. It will set out the situation across the various sectors, including transport, for delivering on the future emissions reduction targets.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of our work to reduce the emissions from public transport. From next month, no diesel-only buses will be purchased for the urban PSO bus fleet and work has also been underway to trial and compare various options for low carbon alternatively-fuelled buses on Irish bus routes.  Of course, less than 5% of Ireland's transport-derived carbon dioxide emissions arise from public transport, so efforts to \"green\" the fleet - though important in leadership terms - will have only a limited impact in reducing emissions.  A critical area of challenge when looking at transport emissions is in targeting the 52% of emissions that come from private car use. This is where public transport and active travel offer real benefits in environmental terms: through expanding their capacity we can facilitate a shift from private car to public transport. Under Project Ireland 2040, we are investing &euro;8.6 billion in Ireland's public transport system.  We want to make public transport and active travel a viable alternative for more people for more of their journeys. Our substantial investment will be used to support the MetroLink, BusConnects and the DART Expansion Programme amongst other important projects. In fact, the NDP budget for new public transport\/active travel projects is well above what we will be investing in new roads, which is a reversal of the balance of investment between these two areas in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100102#WRVV04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":1985,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100103#WRWW00300"},{"type":"question","counter":1986,"qnumday":785,"qnumall":"[24067\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100103#WRWW00400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to examine making grants available to sports clubs that use an organic product (details supplied) when constructing grass playing fields or when making improvements to existing grass playing fields; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":1987,"qnumday":816,"qnumall":"[24065\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100103#WRWW00500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will make the use of an organic product (details supplied) a condition of a sports capital grant for sports clubs that are to receive grants for the provision of grass playing fields or the improvement of grass playing fields; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1988,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 785 and 816 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Sports Capital Programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme funds the development of many types of sports facilities and equipment including the development of natural grass playing surfaces.

The 1:12 ratio was selected following consultation with an expert group on school-age childcare standards.\u00a0 The Group included representatives from DCYA, National Childhood Network, Early Childhood Ireland, Barnardos, Children's Rights Alliance, Better Start, Childcare Committees Ireland, Irish Primary Principals Network, Childminding Ireland, National Parents Council, Quality Development of Out of School Services, Tusla, PL&Eacute; and the Department of Education and Skills among its members. The working group report that was submitted to my Department in 2018 recommended a ratio of 1 adult to 11 children. A 1:8 ratio was recommended in a 2005 working-group report. My Department ultimately decided on a 1:12 ratio.<\/p>  <p>  I do not expect to see an overall reduction in the number of school-age childcare places as a result of the new Regulations. In setting the ratio requirement, current practice was considered; while some providers have until now operated higher ratios than 1:12, the evidence suggests that a majority have operated lower ratios. The 1:12 ratio requirement is close to the expert group recommendation, and while some individual services may have to recruit additional staff or reduce places (if they choose to keep their staffing level constant), this will not be true for all school-age childcare services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Indeed, initial data\u00a0 available to my Department indicates an increase in the number of services offering\u00a0 school-age childcare. This demonstrates that various policy initiatives to encourage additional capacity in school age childcare are working. As of 5th June, 338\u00a0 &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; school-age childcare services (i.e. services that only provide\u00a0 school-age childcare) had applied for registration with Tusla, an increase on the\u00a0 235 such services previously known to DCYA, Tusla and the City\/County Childcare\u00a0 Committees. These services\u00a0are in addition to the approximately 1,600 Early Learning and Care services\u00a0that also provide school-age childcare.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To give service providers time to adjust to the new requirement I made a decision earlier this year, following discussions with sector representatives,  to delay the date on which the 1:12 ratio comes into force by 6 months, from 18th February to 18th August 2019. This decision recognised the difficulty for providers of adjusting their staffing ratio in the middle of the school year. If, in spite of the adjustment period for service providers, any parent finds it difficult securing a school-age childcare place for September, they should contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee, which is available to support parents to locate childcare within their locality. Local contact details for City\/County Childcare Committees can be found at www.myccc.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The 1:12 ratio enables services to make a reasonable profit given that wages in the sector average at &euro;12 per hour and pay costs are services' largest overhead. It should also be possible for services to recruit additional staff for school age childcare given that half of the sector work part-time only (ECCE hours and weeks) and many of these should be available to work additional hours.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Regulations for school-age childcare is a new and important development. While the Regulations introduced this year are limited in scope, I intend to introduce comprehensive Regulations that build on the initial Regulations as well as on the recommendations made by the standards working group.<\/p>  <p>  Public consultation is built into the process of developing these comprehensive Regulations for school-age childcare. On May 21st my Department launched the public consultation process. The consultation comprises an open call for submissions and an online public survey which are open until 5th July, as well as a focus group session with School Age Childcare Providers and an Open Policy Debate, both of which are taking place in June.

The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to providing for adjustments which do not impact negatively on jobs or competitiveness.  The Commission thus takes an evidence-based approach to its recommendations, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.  <\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment the Commission has submitted recommendations on the appropriate rate of the National Minimum Wage for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, for increases of 50 cent in 2016, 10 cent in 2017, 30 cent in 2018 and 25 cent in 2019 have all been accepted by Government and represent an increase in the National Minimum Wage of 13.3% since 2015. With effect from 1 January 2019 the current rate of the National Minimum Wage is &euro;9.80 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent figures published by Eurostat (January 2019) show that Ireland has the second highest national minimum wage of any country in the EU at &euro;1,656.2 per month, behind only Luxembourg whose minimum wage is &euro;2,071 per month (for comparison purposes Eurostat converts countries&rsquo; hourly or weekly rates into monthly rates).  Allowing for purchasing power standards, Ireland drops to sixth place, but still remains in the group with the highest minimum wage rates in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that Ireland&rsquo;s statutory National Minimum Wage and the Living Wage concept are not conflated.  The Living Wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on the social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will pay a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet an individual&rsquo;s basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare.  As a voluntary initiative, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and confers no statutory entitlement.  The National Minimum Wage, on the other hand, has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees, and a statutory obligation on employers. <\/p>  <p>  The setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and Government does not interfere unduly in the process.  More broadly, this area also comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, through her Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for industrial relations issues generally and wage-setting mechanisms such as Registered Employment Agreements (REAs), Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) and Sectoral Employment Orders (SEOs).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100107#WRAAA02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Registration Legislation","counter":2188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100107#WRAAA02700"},{"type":"question","counter":2189,"qnumday":857,"qnumall":"[23442\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100107#WRAAA02800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when persons will be able to retrospectively register as parents as per the Civil Registration Act 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2190,"content":"<p>The sections in the Civil Registration Act 2019 concerning registration, and re-registration, of births of donor-conceived children will come into operation as soon as the relevant sections in Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (CFRA 2015) are commenced.

Self-employed class S contributions are not reckonable toward the award of credits.  <\/p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of carers allowance or benefit can qualify for credits where they have previously entered insurable employment and paid at least one PRSI contribution at Class A, B, C, D, E, H or P and where they have had a recent attachment to the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits can assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes such as the level of payment of State pension contributory (SPC).  Credits do not however, in isolation, entitle individuals to qualify for social insurance benefits.  It should be noted that only contributions in Classes A, E, F, G, H, N and S are reckonable for State pension purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals who are caring and who do not qualify for carers allowance may qualify for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme if their pension is decided by the yearly average method. The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for the SPC, and applies to homemaking periods since 6 April 1994.  It applies equally to both men and women.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme provides that years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person age 12 or over will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for the purposes of determining the rate of their entitlement to SPC. In this way the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme ensures that an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to SPC is protected during periods spent caring.  As the homemakers scheme allows for years to be disregarded from the calculation, it is not considered a credit.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2018, the Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated by a new &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) which will include up to 20 years of a new Home Caring period. Unlike the current Homemakers scheme, this allowance will apply to periods both before and after 1994. This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role. It will make it easier for such pensioners to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory). The TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome, and it also acknowledges, for the first time, the contribution made by home-carers in the period before 1994.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100107#WRAAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Rates","counter":2206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100107#WRAAA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2207,"qnumday":863,"qnumall":"[23248\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100107#WRAAA04600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost if child benefit increased by &euro;10 per month per child; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2208,"content":"<p>The estimated full year cost of increasing child benefit by &euro;10 per month is &euro;146.57 million. <\/p><p>The cost is based on the estimated number of beneficiaries in 2019.

Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.\u00a0 PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the social welfare system.\u00a0 Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, but generally, as these payments are to help them meet their income needs,\u00a0he or she can receive only one of those payments.\u00a0 This principle is common to social security systems across the world.<\/p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.\u00a0 These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits at reduced rates.\u00a0 For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.\u00a0 These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.\u00a0 However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.<\/p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012, in the context of the Government&rsquo;s commitments to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients. There are exceptions to this as in a case where a reduced Widows Pension is in payment and paid at a rate lower than the Illness Benefit Rate. In such circumstances Illness Benefit may be paid to ensure that the aggregate payment will equate with the maximum rate of Illness Benefit appropriate to the person&rsquo;s circumstances.\u00a0 However, it is not possible for someone to be paid both a full rate Widows Contributory Pension (&euro;208.50 for someone under 66, plus allowances) and Illness Benefit (&euro;203.00 plus allowances).\u00a0 Such combined rates of payments, neither of which are subject to a means test, \u00a0would be significantly higher than those paid to other people supported\u00a0by my Department, many of whom are at significantly greater risk of poverty.<\/p>  <p>  To change the underlying principle of entitlement, and allow people claim multiple payments in the manner suggested, would involve significant additional expenditure which could prove unsustainable in the long-term, and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary contexts.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100108#WRBBB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":2241,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100108#WRBBB03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2242,"qnumday":875,"qnumall":"[23518\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100108#WRBBB03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a disability allowance claim by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2243,"content":"<p>The person concerned submitted an application for disability allowance (DA) on 22 January 2019.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;248 million this year on HHB for over 446,000 customers. The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package. Carers who live with the person they are caring for can still have an entitlement to the household benefits package and do not have to satisfy the household composition criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to carer&rsquo;s allowance carers receive additional support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual carers support grant (&euro;1,700) in respect of each person for whom they care.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a person is in receipt of certain qualifying social welfare payments, and also providing full time care and attention to another person, they can keep their primary social welfare payment and also get the half-rate carer's allowance.  It should also be noted that since October 2013 the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance then they will have to undergo a means test for fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) for where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees , is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my department.  <\/p>  <p>  The means test for carers allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000.00, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.00, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100.00. <\/p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 15 hours a week.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to change the qualifying criteria for HHB or fuel allowance would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100111#WREEE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":2388,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100111#WREEE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2389,"qnumday":925,"qnumall":"[24081\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100111#WREEE04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2390,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>CA was awarded to the person concerned on 30 April 2019 with effect from 31 January 2019.

This change was signalled well in advance of its introduction. In 1993, \"Developing the National Pension System - Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; was published, and recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 contributions, in recognition of the expansion of PRSI coverage over the decades. The enabling legislation was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997, which provided for the implementation of the change in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised initially at 260 from 2002, and rising to 520 from April 2012, 15 years after its introduction in law. <\/p>  <p>  Those who were affected by this change may or may not have an alternative State pension payment.  Where they do not and they have made no claim for a state pension, it is not possible to state what the rate of that payment would have been, had there been no policy change. <\/p>  <p>  The second change was introduced as part of Budget 2012.  From September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced. These new rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with less frequent contributions during working life. <\/p>  <p>  Due to the interaction between these and other effects over the period from 2012, it is not possible to isolate the figures requested in tabular form. It has however been estimated that the savings to the Social Insurance Fund resulting from the change in rate bands was rising by roughly &euro;10 million per annum, as they applied to new pensioners from September 2012, and that this would have reached some &euro;60 to &euro;80 million by 2018, based upon those paid in the relevant ratebands.  However, the saving could be higher as some pensioners, as a result of this change, are alternatively paid State pension (non-contributory) at a higher rate than their SPC entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100112#WRFFF02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":2422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100112#WRFFF02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2423,"qnumday":936,"qnumall":"[24171\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100112#WRFFF02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost in 2019 and projected cost in 2020, exclusive of arrears, of reassessing persons for entitlement to a contributory pension under the total contributions approach; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2424,"content":"<p>On 23 January 2018, this Government agreed to a proposal that will allow pensioners affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands to have their pension entitlement calculated on a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) basis, including provision for up to 20 years of a new home caring credit.  The effect of this is that a post-2012 pensioner who has 20 years of HomeCaring periods can qualify for a maximum rate pension with just 20 years of paid contributions.  Most pensioners with only 20 years contributions, whether qualifying under pre-2012 or post-2012 ratebands, could not qualify for a maximum rate pension under the Yearly Average system, unless they first entered insurable employment in their 40s, or later.<\/p>  <p>  The TCA ensures that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions, as opposed to the timing of them, determines what their final pension outcome will be. In particular it will benefit people whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace raising families or in a full-time caring role. Crucially, unlike the current Homemakers scheme or earlier proposals for Homemakers Credits, HomeCaring Periods apply to periods both before and after 1994. This recognises that most people reaching pension age between 2012 and 2019, if they had taken a home caring break looking after young children, would most likely have done so before 1994.<\/p>  <p>  This approach will make it easier for many post-2012 pensioners affected by the 2012 rate band changes to qualify for a higher rate of the State pension (contributory), particularly if they were absent from the workforce caring for children, or an older person with a care need.<\/p>  <p>  Using figures provided by the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, my Department estimated that the cost of the interim TCA approach for those who reach State Pension Age in 2019 would be circa &euro;54 million.  The precise figure will depend upon a number of factors, including take-up of HomeCaring periods, and also the inflows from other payments, where a person has no existing SPC claim in the system, but may now find it more advantageous than their current payment.<\/p>  <p>  At this stage, we do not have sufficient information to provide an estimate for 2020 costs, as the Department intends introducing further reform in this area, TCA 2020, within that timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100112#WRFFF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":2425,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100112#WRFFF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2426,"qnumday":937,"qnumall":"[24174\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100112#WRFFF03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an appeal by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2427,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer on 22nd January 2019.

The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Investment Plan to 2024. Irish Water is to work with Local Authorities across the country in ensuring the investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to core strategies.\u00a0 I understand that it is being proposed that the overall national budget for this Programme would be allocated between counties, based on an identified need against set criteria. <\/p>  <p>  Irish Water is subject to regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).\u00a0 The proposals from Irish Water in this regard form part of the submissions from Irish Water to the CRU on its detailed investment plans under the Irish Water Investment Plan 2020 to 2024.\u00a0 These submissions are currently being considered and a decision is expected from the CRU in the second half of 2019.\u00a0 Subject to the outcome of this process it will then be a matter for Irish Water to progress its proposals in relation to the Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100115#WRJJJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":2548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100115#WRJJJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2549,"qnumday":981,"qnumall":"[23820\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100115#WRJJJ01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to open voluntary redundancy schemes in local authority offices in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2550,"content":"<p>I have no plans at present to introduce a voluntary redundancy scheme for local authority employees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100115#WRJJJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Guidelines","counter":2551,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100115#WRJJJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2552,"qnumday":982,"qnumall":"[23822\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100115#WRJJJ01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a house which is zoned commercial and on the grounds of a hotel in a rent pressure zone will be subject to short-term letting regulations coming into force on 1 July 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2553,"content":"<p>The Planning and Development (Exempted Development) (No.2) Regulations 2019 (the 2019 Regulations), which amend the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, provide that development involving a change of use relating to\u00a0home sharing and limited short-term letting in a principal private residence in a rent pressure zone, is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to compliance with specified notification requirements to the local planning authority.\u00a0 The 2019 Regulations will come into effect from 1 July 2019,\u00a0concurrent with the commencement of the underpinning primary legislative provisions in the recently enacted Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019.<\/p><p>The new arrangements do not apply to properties\u00a0 in rent pressure zones which already have a specific planning permission to be used for tourism or short term letting purposes, including as holiday homes.

The current tenure mix as agreed with the Department is 30% Social and 70% cost rental.<\/p>  <p>  Plans regarding the development of the site at St. Michael's Estate are a matter for Dublin City Council, in the first instance.\u00a0The Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to move the project forward. In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating the establishment of a special Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum specifically for this project. As part of the consultative process open consultation sessions were hosted throughout November 2018. Furthermore, professional advisers have been appointed to develop an Urban Design Framework Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, I appointed Mr Jack Nolan (retired Assistant Garda Commissioner) to undertake a scoping exercise for the Inchicore\/Kilmainham area. This focuses on the long term economic and social regeneration of the community, and it is anticipated that his report will be submitted to me by the end of June.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, my Department had initial discussions with the European Investment Bank (EIB) regarding possible financing options for the St. Michael&rsquo;s site.

When the next vacancy arises, the method for filling the vacancy will be by advertisement through the StateBoards portal operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100117#WRLLL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Oideachas Gaeltachta","counter":2649,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100117#WRLLL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2650,"qnumday":1017,"qnumall":"[24164\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100117#WRLLL02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an ndearnadh aon dul chun cinn maidir leis an bhf&eacute;idearthacht c&aacute;il&iacute;ocht shaincheaptha a shol&aacute;thar san oideachas luathbhlianta tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge do chleacht&oacute;ir&iacute; agus do chleacht&oacute;ir&iacute; ionchasacha, mar at&aacute; pl&eacute;ite sa Pholasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta, 2017-2022; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1316","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":2651,"content":"<p>T&aacute; roinnt bearta idir l&aacute;mha ag mo Roinn i gcomhar le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun tac&uacute; go d&iacute;reach n&oacute; go t&aacute;naisteach le cur i bhfeidhm rath&uacute;il an Pholasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta.

Applications must be advanced in close cooperation with the relevant local authorities which are expected to take the lead with respect to potential World Heritage nominations in their administrative areas. This ensures the longterm involvement of a statutory body in preparing a site for inclusion on the Tentative List. Officials of my Department are also available to assist and advise interested parties.<\/p>  <p>  The process of readying a site for eventual UNESCO World Heritage nomination encompasses the involvement of the community at large and a wide range of stakeholders. Of critical importance when deciding whether a site should be included on the Tentative List is whether it is capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value. This means that the site must possess cultural and\/or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of global importance for present and future generations. As such, the permanent protection of this heritage is of the highest importance to the international community as a whole. This characteristic would be rigorously assessed by an expert committee for any site under consideration for the Tentative List.<\/p>  <p>  Twenty-two candidate sites were put forward for inclusion on the 2010 Tentative List with the majority coming from public bodies. In addition to the newly-nominated sites that were included in the 2010 List, certain other sites had their position on the previous Tentative List renewed. Others were not considered at that time to have demonstrated that they would meet the various criteria set by the World Heritage Committee. I will provide the Deputy with details of the 22 sites separately. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently in the process of managing the ten-year review of Ireland&rsquo;s Tentative List. In this respect, the local authorities associated with each site on the current Tentative List have been invited to review the readiness of their communities and sites to proceed to World Heritage nomination. My Department is tasked with deciding whether or not sites are likely to meet the criteria for World Heritage nomination. It will do so at the end of the review period in June 2020, and with the benefit of additional information provided by the relevant local authorities in the meantime. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100117#WRLLL02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Applications","counter":2657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100117#WRLLL03000"},{"type":"question","counter":2658,"qnumday":1021,"qnumall":"[24314\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100117#WRLLL03100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if steps will be taken to ensure that a person (details supplied) is paid the appropriate compensation for cessation of turf cutting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":2659,"content":"<p>An application for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been received by my Department from the individual referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.
