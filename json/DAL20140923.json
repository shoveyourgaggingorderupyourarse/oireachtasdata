This is an issue of concern to many hill farmers.  The preservation and restoration of commonages, and the continuation of suitable and environmentally friendly farming practices on the hills, is a core element of GLAS and part of Ireland&rsquo;s overall plan for halting biodiversity loss.  In recognition of the importance of commonages, hill farmers will get priority access to GLAS but it is accepted by all that the most effective management of those hills is achieved when those who are actively farming it work together.  That is why the creation of a commonage management plan that encourages the shareholders themselves to take control of the grazing of their commonage is the model we have chosen for GLAS.  In addition, in order to qualify for an agri-environment payment, the actions undertaken by farmers must be above the baseline for the basic payment scheme, and it is the actions in the commonage management plan which demonstrate that.  The only requirement for commonage farmers joining GLAS is for 50% of active farmers to sign up to a GLAS commonage plan or sufficient farmers to bring in at least 50% of the land into the commonage plan.  There is no imposition of minimum or maximum stocking densities, and smaller commonages of less than 10 ha in size will not be subject to any minimum participation requirement.  On commonages of that size, farmers can enter GLAS in their own right.<\/p><p>  I do not believe that a minimum participation requirement based on this model is insurmountable and there are ways in which the application process can be structured that might assist.<\/p><p>However, where real difficulties are being encountered, the farmers concerned can make a case to the commonage implementation committee for entry to the scheme.  If it is clear that the farmer or farmers have made every effort to meet the requirement but have failed through no fault of their own, they will not be locked out of GLAS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300003#A00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411477500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Minister said that if a farmer puts his or her case to the commonage implementation committee, he or she may receive the relevant entitlements through that scheme.

We have spoken to farming organisations and agricultural consultants and planners.  They need at least five months to prepare all of the farmers' applications for the scheme because if we want to include between 25,000 and 30,000 farmers, it means 35,000 or 40,000 farmers could apply.  This means that potentially one third of all farmers in Ireland could apply for GLAS.  It will take a lot of management to ensure all of the applications get in on time given the fact that outside of Teagasc there are only 400 planners in the country.  There is a big job to be done.  We will then need to assess all of the applications.  If we receive all of the applications by May or June, the assessment procedure will take until September and we hope to start payments under the new scheme by the end of next year.

Prices are down by about 10.5% on last year, which saw an all-time high.  So, even though historically the prices at the moment do not look that bad when compared with the prices two or three years ago, certainly the prices that many farmers paid for store cattle last year on the back of very high prices has meant that this year many beef farmers are losing money or making very tight margins.<\/p><p>  We are trying to do a number of things.  First, it is important to say that I cannot set prices, but I can try to improve the structure of how the beef industry operates to increase the negotiating capacity of farmers.  We are trying to do that specifically by setting up producer organisations in the not too distant future.  We are in the middle of a consultation process on that right now and I would welcome feedback from Opposition parties on that.  At the moment beef farmers, unlike those in the dairy sector, effectively negotiate on their own with factories when they bring animals in.  We would like to set up producer organisations which would be legal entities, professionally run, representing 5,000, 7,000 or 10,000 beef farmers.  They would negotiate with factories, probably on a regional basis so that they would have real bargaining power in terms of providing top quality animals at the right age and the right specification to get the best price possible for farmers.  Of course there would be an ongoing negotiation with factories that would improve the communication significantly and deal with much of the mistrust that has existed between farmers and factories over the past 12 months or so.<\/p><p>  We have also had a beef forum, as farmers are calling it.

Consequently, there has been a squeeze which has forced more competitive pricing because retailers have become much bigger and their systems are much larger and more efficient.  Moreover, in many cases, they are very demanding of primary producers.  This is the reason producer organisations are needed and the collective response from the European Union on this in the Common Agricultural Policy has been to support actively producer organisations.  I accept that more must be done and that it must be done collectively as the European Union because were Ireland to try to do this on its own, it simply would make itself totally price-uncompetitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300007#E00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1411478700,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300007#E00700","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1411478700,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Given that we export almost 90% of everything we produce into these other markets, we cannot force prices up in Ireland, which would mean the countries into which we sell at present simply would stop buying from us.

Each year, farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of more than &euro;1.5 billion under schemes such as the single farm payment scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, agri-environment schemes and so on.  This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that member states manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the schemes and general financial provisions.  All of the lands declared by farmers must be eligible if these lands benefit from payment under one of more or these schemes.  Under the terms and conditions of the direct aid schemes, which includes the single payment scheme, farmers are obliged to declare only eligible land when making their applications and are to exclude ineligible features such as roads, buildings, farmyards, dense scrub, etc.  These claims are then recorded on the Department's land parcel identification system, LPIS.  Given the importance of the LPIS database in underpinning direct aid payments worth in excess of &euro;1.5 billion annually, my Department is obliged under EU regulations to ensure its accuracy. <\/p><p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, as part of the normal accounting process, my Department was requested to undertake a complete review of the LPIS database.  This ongoing review is of major significance as the Commission is seeking to disallow &euro;181 million of funding to Ireland relating to payments over the past five years.  As I have explained to the House on a number of occasions, this is currently the subject of an Irish appeal to the EU conciliation body.  This land eligibility review has resulted in the necessity to adjust parcels of a significant number of applicants, where it was established that some ineligible features had been included.  In certain circumstances, these adjustments are giving rise to penalties.<\/p><p>As I have said previously when I outlined the numbers involved, the vast majority of farmers in Ireland are not affected by this but some are affected in a minor way - we are trying to deal with those farmers - and a relatively small number of farmers have a big issue in this regard.

It is equivalent to approximately 750,000 cattle, so there is much trade between Ireland and Britain.  The British retailers&rsquo; long-standing policy is to market British and Irish beef separately so as to avoid any perceived confusion for consumers. This means beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country or the other; they are labelled as born, reared and slaughtered in the same EU state.  Therefore, animals which originate in the republic and are sent North for rearing or slaughter fall out of the retailers specifications, as they will have to be labelled as coming from two separate states.  I suspect the Deputy would like - as I would - this island to be one country but it is not at the moment, so there is a requirement for a country of origin label that is accurate.  That is the issue with which UK retailers have an issue.<br\/><br\/>The number of such animals is relatively small in overall terms at 50,000 per year and there has been an impact on some of the trade in live cattle into Northern Ireland, which traditionally has been an important outlet for the Irish beef sector.  Nevertheless, I am pleased to note that mart sales in the last fortnight are reported as strong both in terms of price and volumes being traded.  As a result of the difficulties earlier in the year, I have engaged with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Minister, Ms Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, in order to try to alleviate some of the pressures being felt by farmers involved in the cross-Border trade.  We agreed to make a joint approach to the three British retailers who stock Irish beef, accepting that these were commercial matters, but also seeking some flexibility, given that this beef is produced to the exacting standards required by British consumers.  I have also met separately with representatives of Tesco recently and we had a useful and frank discussion on this and other issues regarding the beef market generally.  I have also convened a meeting with the Minister, Ms O'Neill, and those involved with the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, which will take place in Dublin in the coming weeks.  This will provide a useful forum to further explore the retailer concerns and identify possible solutions.

The kind of animals we are looking for in the beef trade has been down somewhat.  We need Northern buyers in marts, providing competition to get the best prices for animals, and so on, and that has picked up significantly in recent weeks.  To be fair to Tesco, it said it was willing to consider this.  It is very strict about label accuracy, to make sure that it looks after its consumers, but it recognised that its customers would not have a problem with an Irish label on beef produced to more or less the same standards, North and South on the island of Ireland, as long as there was proper label clarity underneath that.

Other markets do not have such restrictions.  Some markets have weight restrictions as well.  British retailers, which comprise the highest paying market for beef in the world at the moment, want beef steaks that are smaller than those being sold by some Irish producers that are producing really good animals.  When there is a lot of beef around the market, as there has been this year, the premium markets that are paying the most for that beef can choose to demand certain specifications.  That has been one of the most significant problems over the past 12 months, particularly for producers of large continental animals of a certain age.  They got very good money for animals of that age last year, but they are being penalised for animals of the same age this year.  That is why there needs to be a much better line of communication between factories and primary producers.

The idea underpinning the commonage areas implementation group is that a group of experienced people, who are farmer-friendly, speak a language everybody understands and have an appreciation of commonage farming, will sit down and work out with farmers what they need to do to qualify for basic payments.  It is very straightforward.  The only thing a farmer will be required to do to get a single farm payment is have a minimum stocking rate of one ewe per 1.5 hectares.  Essentially, he or she will need to have one sheep for each area of between three and a half and four acres.  Obviously, we discussed this very low stocking rate with the farming organisations before we settled on it.  We have to be credible with the Commission.  There needs to be some level of proof that there is farming activity going on in the hills.  The obvious way to do that is to focus on stocking levels.  The only thing a farmer has to do to qualify for a single farm payment is have a stocking rate of one ewe per 1.5 hectares by the end of next year.  If one has not been doing much farming over recent years, or if one has a very low stocking rate, one should be fine as long as one builds up a basic stocking rate before the end of next year.  If one is farming in an area where a lower stocking rate is required because of environmental restrictions, that is fine.  One automatically qualifies as long as one has some level of stocking.  There seems to have been a great deal of confusion about how farmers with commonage can qualify for a single farm payment.  I want to clarify that it is very easy for them to qualify.  They just need to have some level of activity in the commonage land.  We are measuring that by providing for a very low stocking rate threshold.<\/p><p>  GLAS is a bit different.  Commonage farmers will get priority access and acceptance into GLAS.  As I said in response to an earlier question, if GLAS is to be credible, farmers have to do something else, other than qualifying for a single farm payment, to get &euro;5,000.  Essentially, they have to agree to farm in accordance with a GLAS commonage plan.<\/p><p>At least 50% of the active farmers in that commonage area or the farmers who own 50% of the area of the commonage have to be doing that.  If, for whatever reason, farmers who want to apply to GLAS cannot get 50% of the active farmers in the commonage area to be part of it, they can work through the implementation group which will help them to do it.

Will the farmers all be obliged to put some of their stock on the marginal land or the commonage?

I know it is an issue of concern to her and I wish to give her a detailed answer to it.  The wildlife policy, which is a component of my Department&rsquo;s TB eradication programme, has been developed in response to research which has demonstrated that the eradication of the disease is not a practicable proposition until the reservoir of infection in badgers is addressed.  Capturing of badgers takes place in areas where serious outbreaks of TB have been identified in cattle herds and where Department veterinarians have found, following an epidemiological examination, that badgers are the likely source of infections.  Approximately 6,000 badgers are culled annually by trained contractors under licence and the process is monitored and supervised by Department staff.  In tandem with the badger removal programme, my Department continues to sponsor research and trials into developing a vaccination programme to control tuberculosis in badgers, thus improving the overall health status of that species, and to break the infection link to cattle.  The research to date has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against bovine TB.  Current research is aimed at confirming that such a protective effect holds true in the wild population.<\/p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to incorporate badger vaccination into the TB eradication programme when data are available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner.  A number of field trials are ongoing with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term in the interests of ensuring that the progress achieved in recent years in combating TB in cattle is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300017#P00500","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1411483500,"counter":133,"content":"<p>That is a most unfortunate answer because in the context of a badger cull we are talking about a most inhumane, cruel and barbaric way of dealing with bovine TB, when first, it has not been fully proven that the badger is totally responsible for the disease, and there are doubts over some of the experiments that initially proved that was the case.  Second, a reduction in TB in cattle can also be linked to improved husbandry and other factors, not especially through the badger cull.  Could the Minister explain the urgency to kill thousands of an ecologically important species, namely, the badger?<\/p><p>  I refer to an IT glitch that occurred in the Department for Environment, Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs in England which meant it overstated the number of cattle herds infected by TB in Britain to such an extent that the decline in TB was shown to have been in the year preceding the badger cull.  A badger cull is a particularly cruel way to deal with the problem.  Illegal ways are in use to kill badgers.  Such horrible practices, include putting slurry in badger setts, and throwing badger carcases onto the road to give the impression they have been killed in road accidents.

We have less TB in Ireland now than at any time since 1953 when records began.  The UK cannot say the same.  If anything, depending on the region, the jurisdiction has an increasing problem with TB in herds.  The system we have in place at the moment is working.  We are targeting areas where there are significant TB outbreaks where we have a reason to believe there is a link with wildlife infection by badgers.  It is not an indiscriminate culling of badgers throughout the country.  It is a targeted effort to try to catch and put down badgers we believe might have TB themselves and are spreading TB to cattle.  Culling has been a part of a very effective TB programme that is reducing TB dramatically in Ireland and is saving the taxpayer a lot of money.  As soon as we can introduce a vaccination programme to target TB in badgers that is credible and that can take the place of the targeted culling programme, we will do it.

The purpose of the series is to explore the dynamics in business employment &ndash; the flow of jobs and persons between firms and within and between sectors, using a methodology adapted from research literature in this area.<br\/><br\/>The job churn series is based on a statistical analysis of administrative data from the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue information is provided to the CSO under the Statistics Act 1993 and is used solely for statistical purposes.  The estimates of job churn relate to all employing enterprises in key sectors of the business economy as classified by the standard European classification of economic activity.  The most recent data which the CSO has compiled on this topic are for the year 2011.<br\/><br\/>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a table showing the estimates of job creation, job destruction, the resulting net jobs created and the corresponding estimated weekly pay of hirings for the years 2006 to 2011.  Key features from this table are as follows.  Between 2010 and 2011, an estimated 210,985 jobs were created, with a net 9,972 jobs created after jobs lost are taken into account.  In the preceding three years, the net figure was negative, with a large volume of net job destruction.  Between 2007 and 2008, the net job loss figure was 131,926; between 2008 and 2009 it was 364,726; and between 2009 and 2010 the net number of jobs lost was 104,589.  The sectors which had the greatest job loss over that three year period were construction, and wholesale and retail trade, including repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles.  In 2011, the estimated weekly pay for jobs lost was &euro;502.92 and the weekly pay for jobs created was &euro;562.25.  The average weekly pay for all jobs in the business economy was &euro;632.56.<br\/><br\/>These figures are based on administrative data sources.  They supplement the existing CSO series based on the quarterly national household survey and earnings surveys, but they are not directly comparable to those surveys, as they are compiled from an administrative source.  The value of this new series is that it provides more detail on the dynamics of the labour market.  The CSO is continuing to work on this new series and plans to have figures for 2012 and 2013 available by the end of December 2014.<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th><div>2006<\/div><\/th><th><div>2007<\/div><\/th><th><div>2008<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Business economy excluding activities of holding companies (B to N,-642)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job creation (Number)<\/td><td><div>353,614<\/div><\/td><td><div>375,167<\/div><\/td><td><div>217,819<\/div><\/td><td><div>146,889<\/div><\/td><td><div>183,445<\/div><\/td><td><div>210,985<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Job destruction (Number)<\/td><td><div>198,209<\/div><\/td><td><div>228,356<\/div><\/td><td><div>349,745<\/div><\/td><td><div>511,615<\/div><\/td><td><div>288,034<\/div><\/td><td><div>201,013<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Job Creation<\/td><td><div>155,405<\/div><\/td><td><div>146,811<\/div><\/td><td><div>-131,926<\/div><\/td><td><div>-364,726<\/div><\/td><td><div>-104,589<\/div><\/td><td><div>9,972<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hirings -

What happened?  The job creation rate in the first half of 2014 collapsed relative to that.  What happened to the 5,000 a month the Government was boasting about?  Is it not very clear that the points we made at the time, which was that half of the claimed job creation in 2013 was most likely - it still has not been confirmed - due to statistical realignment after the census and that the second half was in very low paid sectors such as hotel and catering, were correct?  We welcome every single job, but we want decent wages and security for the workers, which is not the trend at present.  In the first half of 2014, the total number of jobs in the economy fell by 8,000.  That is the reality and it is accounted for by emigration and other factors.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to be straight and honest with the people.  Currently counted within the labour force are 95,000 to 105,000 people who are on labour activation schemes simply as a method to take them off the dole figures, which as everybody knows has been widely exposed as trickery.  It is employing taxpayers' funds to subsidise sometimes very big employers for semi-slave labour, with workers forced off the dole to work for nothing essentially.  Is that not verified by the recent revelation that in the Department of Education and Skills incredibly the State is increasingly dependent on JobBridge and the likes to employ special needs assistants, teachers, cleaners and office staff as semi-slave labour at taxpayers' expense?<\/p><p>  Does the Minister of State agree that the Government has been putting out quite sophisticated propaganda to cover up the reality that any recovery in the Irish economy, such as it is, is for the benefit of a small elite at the top and has not really got through in any sense to ordinary working people on the ground?  While trumpeting this there is a complete ignoring of the fact that the suffering continues for the victims of austerity and bailout.  Of course the Michael Hassenstabs of the world and their ilk will benefit massively from what is going on at the expense of ordinary people.  Unfortunately the capitalist media, which are cheerleaders for the Government, were cheerleaders for the speculation and the boom.  They then became cheerleaders for austerity and are now giving uncritical headlines for bloated Government propaganda.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to speak directly, for example, to 16 bricklayers and construction workers, members of Unite, who were forced on strike-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S00700","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":229,"content":"<p>We are straying a bit here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S00800","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>-----in Lucan at Kishoge Community College - a Department of Education and Skills scheme - because their employer forced them on pain of lock-out to change from being-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S00900","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S01000","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":232,"content":"<p>-----employed workers to bogus subcontractors-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S01100","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":233,"content":"<p>That is a separate question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S01200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1411485300,"counter":234,"content":"<p>-----for &euro;5 an hour.<\/p><p>Is that the type of economy over which the Government now is prepared to stand because that is the reality of the so-called recovery for many working-class people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300020#S01300","speaker":"954","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411485900,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Sorry, could I just explain?

During my time in this House, since 2002, Deputy Higgins's train of thought has never changed.  Allow me to outline to the Ceann Comhairle that unemployment decreased by 46,200, that is, by 15.4%, on an annual basis between the second quarters of 2013 and 2014, bringing the total number of persons unemployed to 254,500.  This is the eighth quarter in succession in which unemployment has declined on an annual basis.  The overall unadjusted unemployment rate decreased from 13.9% to 11.8% over the year up to the second quarter of 2014.  On a seasonally-adjusted basis, the unemployment rate decreased from 12% in the first quarter of 2014 to 11.5% in the second quarter of 2014, while the number of persons unemployed fell by 12,700 between the first and second quarters of 2014.  The total number of persons classified as unemployed on a seasonally-adjusted basis was 247,700 in the second quarter of 2014, which compares with a peak of 326,000 in the first quarter of 2012.  The seasonally-adjusted unemployment total of 247,700 in the second quarter of 2014 is the lowest since the first quarter of 2009, when the seasonally-adjusted number of persons unemployed was 229,000.<\/p><p>  The number of persons aged between 15 and 24, that is, youths, who are classified as unemployed in the second quarter of 2014 was 52,000.  This represents a decrease of 12,200 or 18.8% when compared with the second quarter of 2013.  Youth unemployment was 76,000 two years previously, in the second quarter of 2012.  The number of persons aged between 16 and 24 and not in employment, education or training was 73,400 in the second quarter of 2014, which represents a decrease of 4,300 since the second quarter of 2013, when the number of persons aged between 16 and 24 and not in employment, education or training was 77,000.<\/p><p>  I should remind Deputy Higgins that last week's jobs included 115 in Dairygold, 500 in Argos, 300 in food start-ups, 75 in TK Maxx, 50 in Dealz, 45 in CaterWaste, 40 in A &amp;amp; L Goodbody, 40 in Stanton Fisher, 20 in Kedington Direct and ten in Subway.

In addition, the export figures that were weak in 2013 have strengthened this year, which also has led to the increase in gross domestic product, GDP.  However one key issue with regard to the jobs crisis in the State is that internationally, Ireland is an outlier with regard to the number of people who have lost their jobs since 2008 and in respect of the current unemployment crisis.

Notwithstanding my agreement with some of the points made by Deputy Higgins, on the whole area of labour activation, this is not the first Government to use it as a way of dealing with an unemployment crisis and Members should not underestimate its importance because in terms of society, labour activation is playing an important role.<\/p><p>However, it can be only a short-term response, and it can only seek to address the short-term social problems that confront us.  Competitiveness in the economy was a challenge that existed for this Government, and it has acted successfully in reducing VAT on the hospitality sector.  I welcome the employment that is supported by that measure, with many of those jobs being good and worthwhile.  However, there is a developing view in Irish society that the Fine Gael Party element of the Government has as its mission, in tackling the issue of competitiveness, to continue to drive down wages to the point that many of the jobs being created are in yellow pack, low-paid employment.  That is not what any of us on this side of the House wants.<\/p><p> I note with concern that 46% of those persons who emigrated in recent times were in employment before they left.  What does it say about the current employment and taxation regime if such a large cohort of young people with jobs are leaving the country?  When we look to Spain, Italy and Greece, we see frightening levels of youth unemployment of 50% or more.  The reality, however, is that our youth unemployment level has been disproportionately distorted by the emigration situation.  If we did not have the tradition of emigration we have in this country, I do not know if the problem would not be far greater.  Will the Minister of State address these concerns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300021#T02200","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411486500,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I am surprised to hear the Deputy speak about yellow pack workers and single out the Fine Gael Party's policy given that his party, when it was in government, reduced the national minimum wage, a measure for which the Deputy voted.  No person has ever come to me with a concern regarding my party's position on this issue.  Indeed, the figures stand up for themselves in terms of the measures we are taking.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to the large numbers of persons leaving this country who are in employment.  We are an island nation and many of our young people want to travel and see the world.  Members of my own family have left jobs to go abroad for that purpose.  I agree that the figures might look alarming, but the reality is that the people who leave jobs in Ireland for Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere are doing so of their own free will.  In the case of persons who were forced to leave because of unemployment, it seems that large numbers of them are now coming back.  I have spoken to many parents in recent months whose children are returning because they see a brighter future for our economy and country, with opportunities now available which were not there in 2008 and 2009, when we saw the highest rate of departure from this country.  I do not have any explanation for why people would choose to leave Ireland when they have a job here, other than to say that their reasons would be varied.<\/p><p>  We have a long way to go regarding the hospitality sector, but the figures are positive.  It is a work in progress and we are moving in the right direction.  Overall, the unemployment level is falling, which everybody in the House welcomes.  That improvement is largely down to the sacrifices Irish people have made in recent years.  Our objective is to ensure this is a better country to live in, with full unemployment by 2020 and every young person having an opportunity of employment.  Earlier today I opened a new facility in Trinity College where several lecturers and other staff members observed that there is no comparison between the opportunities now available to graduates compared with the situation five or six years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300022#U00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1411486500,"counter":259,"content":"<p>These statistical questions are important because there is nothing which infuriates people more than being told things are getting better for them when they self-evidently are not.

I feel it is important to raise the issue in the D&aacute;il at an early date.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it is critical to provide certainty on Ireland's corporation tax regime.  All of the main political parties in this House subscribe to the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  However, as important as the rate itself is the corporation tax system, which is administered by Revenue and underpinned by legislation.  There has been considerable speculation as to what the report means for Ireland in terms of changes the Minister might seek to make in the budget.  I seek reassurance from him in regard to his intentions because we should be under no illusions - I am sure he is not - that Ireland is operating in a highly competitive environment when it comes to foreign direct investment.  Ireland's corporation tax rate and system have been fundamental to our success in attracting inward investment over many years.<\/p><p>  It has been clear for some time that our corporation tax system is in the spotlight and, in many respects, under attack.  There was commentary, much of it inaccurate, at US Senate hearings and in the UK House of Commons, and a European Commission probe is ongoing into the treatment of one company by Revenue.  It is important that Ireland moves in parallel with other countries.  The OECD listed a number of countries as having harmful tax practices, but Ireland was not one of them.  However, a head of steam appears to be building to the effect that Ireland will make a unilateral move on certain aspects of our system.  The double Irish has been highlighted as a case in point.  The questions I have to pose - I do not have all the answers - are what is the cost of doing nothing on the issue and what is the cost of acting on it.  Would it be sufficient to signal a roadmap of changes that the Minister intends to make over the coming period in respect of our corporation tax offering?<\/p><p>  It appears to me from my discussions with multinational companies, their representative bodies and their professional advisers that Ireland's corporation tax offering has become less attractive compared to the UK's offering in recent times.  The UK authorities have upped their game considerably.  I am getting that feedback from the companies concerned, and I am sure the Minister and his officials are getting similar feedback on the UK's move on the patent box, the reduction in its corporation tax rate and the manner in which it treats overseas profits from a corporation tax point of view.  Ireland needs to play hard but fair, and Ireland needs to play to win when it comes to foreign direct investment.  I am loth to see a situation in which we make unilateral moves before other countries change their systems.  Compared to many other countries, Ireland's system is open, transparent and underpinned by legislation.  The Minister knows full well the importance of the investment and employment that multinationals bring to this country.  I want to see that supported and protected and if he is going to make any changes, they have to be in the context of an overall package of improving our corporation tax offering, such as in regard to the treatment of intellectual property and research and development.  These issues are fundamental to companies seeking to invest in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300024#W00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1411487700,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this important issue for debate because the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process and international tax generally have received significant media attention recently.  Due to a need for a multilateral solution to this international problem, the G20 asked the OECD to report with recommendations on how to tackle aggressive and harmful tax planning.  The resultant OECD project is known as the OECD base erosion and profit shifting project.  When a company undertakes base erosion, it is attempting to reduce its taxable income and thereby reduce the amount of tax it has to pay.  The practice of profit shifting is to move profits from one jurisdiction to another.<\/p><p>  In July 2013, the OECD launched an action plan on BEPS, identifying 15 specific actions needed in order to equip governments with the domestic and international instruments to address these challenges.  The BEPS project is not seeking to harmonise tax rates across its members as the action plan because, as it states, &quot;tax policy is not only the expression of national sovereignty but it is at the core of this sovereignty, and each county is free to devise its tax system in the way it considers most appropriate&quot;.  Further, the project is not opposed to tax competition in member states but instead opposes harmful tax competition adopted by jurisdictions.  It is fundamentally important to distinguish between these two types of tax competition.  For instance, a low rate of tax is a policy lever that can be used by countries, especially smaller, peripheral countries, that seek to attract foreign direct investment for growth.<\/p><p>  Many of the BEPS actions are technically complex but at its heart BEPS is a simple concept with two key pillars, namely, to align more strictly substance and taxing rights, in other words, companies should be taxed where they have their substantive operations; and to address harmful tax regimes.  This is in line with Ireland's overall strategy for attracting foreign direct investment.  Ireland has not been and will never will be a brass plate location.  We only have and want substantive foreign direct investment - the kind that brings real jobs.  That is why I believe that the OECD BEPS project offers more opportunities for Ireland than risks.  We have welcomed the first set of BEPS reports, which were released last week, because they are the first milestone in this two year process.  The reports examine a number of different areas and the draft recommendations are very positive.  As I noted last week, Ireland agrees in particular with the conclusion of the report on the digital economy that the sector should not be ring-fenced from the economy as a whole.  There has also been good progress in the areas of coherence, substance and transparency, and while further work is required in some of these areas, the reports are a further step towards multilateral co-operation on countering base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals.<\/p><p>  At 12.5%, Ireland has the lowest general corporate tax rate in the OECD.  Corporate tax rates are a matter of national sovereignty.  This Government is committed to maintaining the rate.  Ireland's offering of a competitive corporate tax rate, the availability of skills and our reputation for being business friendly give us a huge advantage that other countries will struggle to match.  As international tax loopholes progressively get closed down, our low general corporation tax rate will become even more attractive.  Indeed, as we continue to improve our offering for knowledge-based investment, research and development, and intellectual property, I believe that over the coming years we can grow our share of FDI related investment.  In recognition of the importance of the BEPS project, my Department held a public consultation on it earlier this year to start a national conversation on how Ireland should best position itself in a post-BEPS environment.  We received a lot of very interesting responses which will feed into my deliberations for budget 2015.  I plan to publish the results of this consultation in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300024#W00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1411487700,"counter":316,"content":"<p>All of us accept that change is coming to the international corporation tax environment.  The question for Ireland is whether we anticipate those changes by seeking first mover advantage, if there is an advantage to moving first, or wait to see how other countries respond and move in step with them.  I am concerned that, if Ireland moves unilaterally on the double Irish issue, the focus will move to other issues pertaining to our corporation tax regime in the absence of other countries making changes to their systems.  We may lose a competitive edge and it would be the second significant change in 12 months to our corporation tax regime.  The Minister dealt with the issue of stateless companies in last year's budget.<\/p><p> The issue of certainty is fundamental to corporation tax and inward investment decisions.  My instinct is that Ireland should move on an agreed basis with other countries and be cautious about making any changes to our corporation tax regime.  We should be under no illusions that behind all this international drive towards an improved corporation tax environment, other countries are looking at Ireland with envy because of the more than 150,000 direct jobs in multinationals here and the investment associated with that.  They want our jobs and investment.

We will have to defend resolutely our right to set our own tax rates, and nobody in any of the fora which have discussed these issues has suggested we would be compelled to move away from the 12.5% rate.  That rate is the centre point, together with the availability of skilled young people to work in industry.

The Minister of State will be aware that the national director of acute hospital services published a report in which he said that the 24-hour a day, seven days a week accident and emergency unit in Portlaoise was \"not clinically sustainable\".  His report went on to say that the department should be replaced by a medical assessment unit and local injury clinic operating during daytime hours only.  He added that other services, such as day care surgery, endoscopy and a local injury unit should be developed to make up for the loss of emergency and surgery facilities, as happened after other hospitals closed their units.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health, responding to public pressure, said there were absolutely no plans to close the unit.  I accept that but the question of downgrading the unit is in the offing.  The report did not mention closing it.  It referred to scaling it down and replacing it.  The Department of Health&rsquo;s submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as part of the Government&rsquo;s comprehensive spending review, suggested closing 24-hour services at five hospital emergency departments, including Portlaoise, if its budget were cut.  The Department of Health has caused this scare.  Maybe it is trying to frighten off the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by saying if it cuts the budget it will close the accident and emergency unit.<\/p><p>  That the Department is suggesting this possibility undermines the unit in Portlaoise hospital.

Its budget is &euro;10 million lower than that of Naas General Hospital.  I am not asking the Minister of State to rob the hospital in Naas.  I do not want her to rob Peter to pay Paul.  Despite having a bigger workload it has a much lower budget than Naas General Hospital.  This year it had a budget of only &euro;44 million which is approximately &euro;8 million less than it had a few years ago when its budget was in excess of &euro;51 million.  The budget just about covers the payroll.  Despite the best efforts of management and staff the hospital seems to be always in a precarious situation.

I think they will understand that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is unable to be here, unfortunately.  As the Minister has previously said, there are no plans to close the emergency department at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  Following the Chief Medical Officer's report last January on maternity services in the hospital and a visit to the hospital by the HSE national surgical clinical programme, the HSE undertook a performance diagnostic to ascertain the current performance status of the hospital in all aspects of service provision.  The report identified a number of issues and made key recommendations with regard to control, leadership and clinical services at the hospital.  The report suggested that some services in the hospital need to be reconfigured to ensure patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can meet their needs.  The over-riding concern is to address any patient safety and quality concerns that arise.<\/p><p>  The HSE is working through an action plan with the staff in the hospital to stabilise and improve services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  Changes are required to enhance existing resources and structures at the hospital and to address clinical service deficiencies.  A joint governance group has been established to ensure appropriate accountability and oversight of required actions and to incorporate the hospital into the existing governance structures within the Dublin and midlands hospital group, which includes St. James's Hospital and the Coombe, working in collaboration with the children's hospital group.  A project team, which has been formed to support the work of the governance group, is in the hospital on a regular basis to support staff on the ground.  Immediate actions to stabilise service provision include the appointment of an advanced nurse practitioner and the recruitment of a temporary consultant emergency physician to address the immediate senior decision-making issues within the emergency department.  The filling of an additional physician post and replacement posts in endocrinology and care of the elderly is also being advanced.<\/p><p>  The joint governance group will also examine the future service configuration at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, including emergency department services.  It will explore opportunities to develop services like endoscopy and day surgery.  Any potential future reconfiguration of services will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner.  It will take account of existing patient flows, demands in other hospitals and the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of overall service configuration in the Dublin and midlands hospital group.  Recent media reports on the wider issue - the retention of funding for 24-hour emergency departments and the current number of beds across the system - were based on information in the Department's submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform under the Government's comprehensive review of expenditure exercise.  This review exercise is carried out every three to four years.  The last such review was completed in 2011.  As the Department's submission under the current exercise is under consideration, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this point, other than to say it is currently not planned to implement measures contained in that submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300027#Z00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1411488900,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The submission the Department of Health sent to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggested that five accident and emergency departments, including the one in Portlaoise, should be downgraded.

This is quite a technical Bill, with a total of 44 sections.  It has three main objectives, the first of which is to provide for the subsuming of the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.  The Bill also makes certain amendments to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 in the interests of efficiency and to ensure consistency with the legislation governing other health regulators.<\/p><p>The Bill also amends the Health Act 1970 to ensure that statutory contributions are payable by recipients of residential support services who, while maintained, are not directly accommodated by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p> The first objective and the original main purpose of the Bill, which is to subsume the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, is in furtherance of the ongoing programme of State agency rationalisation.  The intention is to transfer the regulation of the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician from the Opticians Act 1956 to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  I would like to pay tribute, at this stage, to the Opticians Board's outgoing president, members, its registrar and their predecessors who have been regulating the optical professions for almost 60 years.  The amalgamation of the Opticians Board with a more broad-based, multi-profession regulator will move the regulation of these professions into a modern regulatory regime where the primary and overriding focus will continue to be on the protection of the public.  I know that the professional bodies representing optometrists and ophthalmologists have concerns regarding the transition to a new regulatory regime under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and, in particular, with the proposed composition of the new optical registration board and I would like to provide some assurances on these points.  I note, however, that a statement was issued today welcoming the new regime, for which I am thankful.<\/p><p> The Opticians Act 1956 provides for an eleven-member board comprising five optometrists, one dispensing optician, four medical practitioners and one other person who may also be a medical practitioner.  In contrast, the thirteen-member registration boards established under the 2005 Act have a lay majority of one, in line with modern legislation governing other health professionals such as doctors and nurses.  The interim optical registration board, whose members will be appointed to the new statutory board when this Bill is enacted, includes four optometrists and two dispensing opticians.  It also includes two medical practitioners, one of which is a consultant ophthalmologist, who were appointed to represent the public interest on this occasion.  The Act allows a degree of flexibility to cater for the particular skill needs of the board at particular times.  Accordingly, the public interest representation of future boards may differ from the current board.  Also, on the same basis, the ratio of optometrists to dispensing opticians may be varied in the future, subject to the appointment of at least one member of each profession.  The lay-majority model is working well for the other six registration boards and I would urge the professional bodies to work constructively with the new board.  <\/p><p> Similarly, the approach to regulating professionals is somewhat different under the amended 2005 Act.  It is less prescriptive but, I would argue, more effective than the 1956 Act which currently regulates opticians.  The focus is on the protection of the public by confining the use of professional titles solely to registrants who are obliged to comply with their profession's code of professional conduct and ethics.  If, as in the 1956 Act, the Bill provided for the inclusion, in primary legislation, of a specific prohibition on the treatment of eye diseases by opticians and an explicit requirement to inform patients of suspected eye diseases or conditions, it would result in optometrists and dispensing opticians being treated differently to the other professions registered under the 2005 Act.  These are matters that are more appropriate to the code of professional conduct and ethics that will be adopted by the optical registration board.  The code will require registrants to act within the limits of their knowledge, skills, competence and experience in the interest of public protection.  Any breach of the code is defined in the Act as professional misconduct which would be liable to investigation and sanctions under the 2005 Act's fitness to practice provisions.<\/p><p> I would now like to provide the House with some background to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which will apply to optometrists and dispensing opticians on the enactment of this Bill and with an update on its implementation to date.  The Act currently provides for the statutory regulation of 12 other designated health and social care professions, namely the professions of clinical biochemist, dietitian, medical scientist, occupational therapist, orthoptist, physiotherapist, podiatrist, psychologist, radiographer, social care worker, social worker and speech and language therapist.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration.  The structure of the system of statutory registration comprises registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  CORU is also charged with the promotion of high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants. <\/p><p> The Act provides for &quot;grand-parenting&quot; which is a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners must register on the basis of specified qualifications.  After this period, only registrants of a registration board, who will be subject to the Act's regulatory regime, will be entitled to use the relevant designated title.  As optometrists and dispensing opticians are already regulated under the 1956 Act, no transitional period will apply to them and their transfer to the 2005 Act will be seamless.<\/p><p> To date, the registers of two professions, namely social workers and radiographers, have been established. The Social Workers Registration Board's two-year transitional period ended in May of last year.  This means that all persons using the title of social worker are now obliged to be registered and are subject to the provisions of the Act.  The transitional period for the profession of radiographer will end in October of next year.  Meanwhile, the registers for the professions of speech and language therapist, dietitian and occupational therapist will be established by their registration boards before the end of this year.  The remaining professions are following close behind and I expect that the registers of all 12 professions will be open by the end of 2016.  <\/p><p> From a public protection viewpoint, a crucial milestone in the regulation of the Act's designated health and social care professions will be the introduction of a robust fitness to practice regime.  This will involve the commencement of Part 6 of the Act to allow complaints about the conduct or competence of registrants to be investigated.  Disciplinary sanctions, where complaints are substantiated, up to and including cancellation of registration, may be imposed.  The regime will be similar to that applicable to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.  CORU is currently putting in place the necessary legal and administrative arrangements to allow the new fitness practice regime to be implemented and I hope to be in a position to make the necessary commencement order before the end of this year. <\/p><p> I would also like to update the House on proposals to regulate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist which are not currently designated under the Act.  This issue has been the subject of many Topical Issues debates in the House in the recent past.  The Minister for Health may designate health or social care professions not currently designated if he or she considers that it is in the public interest to do so and if the specified criteria have been met.  The previous Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wrote to the Health and Social Care Professionals Council in May of this year advising it of his intention, in the public interest, to designate by regulation the profession or professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under section 4(2) of the Act.  The Act provides that the Minister for Health is obliged to consult with the council in the first instance concerning a proposed designation and to give interested persons, organisation and bodies an opportunity to make representations to the Minister.  The council has been asked to advise on a number of issues concerning the proposed designation and to take into consideration the recently published report of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, on the academic standards necessary for the accreditation of courses in counselling and psychotherapy.  This is an essential element as it will inform, for the purpose of registration, the assessment by the registration board, when established, of the qualifications of those currently in practice.  This is the first stage in the consultation process under the Act and I expect t receive the council's report in the coming weeks.  I will proceed to the next stage, which will involve a much wider consultation, when I have fully considered the council's report.<\/p><p>While a number of issues remain to be clarified including decisions on whether one or two professions are to be regulated, on the title or titles of the profession or professions, and on the minimum qualifications to be required of applicants for registration, the proposals to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists are being progressed as a priority.  It is hoped the necessary designation regulations can be made early next year.  Expressions of interest will then be sought from suitably qualified persons available for appointment to the new registration board that will be established to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists.<br\/><br\/>I am aware of other professions seeking designation under the Act.  Creative arts therapists and audiologists, for example, have been making a case for regulation for some time.  The immediate priority, however, is to establish the regulatory process for the 12 professions already designated and to come to final decisions, following the detailed consultation process, on the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists.  When all the registers have been established, towards the end of 2016, the Department will ask CORU to prepare a risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation, and to make recommendations concerning options for their possible future regulation.<br\/><br\/>The second objective of the Bill is to make certain amendments to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 in the interest of the efficient running of the regulatory system and to ensure consistency with the legislation governing other health regulators.  In summary, under this objective, the Bill will divide, for the purposes of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the designated profession of radiographer into the two designated professions of radiographer and radiation therapist, permit a registration board to regulate two or more designated professions, and introduce uniformity between the Act and certain provisions of other Acts which regulate medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.  The division of the designated profession of radiographer into two designated professions of radiographer and radiation therapist, for the purposes of the 2005 Act, is in response to the evolution of the profession into two professions for all practical purposes.  Over time, the training, qualifications and scopes of practice of diagnostic radiographers who take images and radiation therapists who apply radiation treatment have continued to diverge.  This division for regulatory purposes has been recommended by the Radiographers Registration Board and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.<br\/><br\/>The existing 13-member Radiographers Registration Board will regulate the professions of radiographer and radiation therapist and the Optical Registration Board will regulate the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician.  This is a new departure as up to now each profession had its own registration board.  The Bill also provides that newly designated professions may, in the future, be regulated by an existing registration board.  These measures will limit the number of new registration boards to be established as new professions are designated.  Registration boards with two or more professions would still have 13 members, the existing balance between the number of lay and professional members would be maintained, and each of the board's professions would have at least one professional member on the board.  In time, in order that CORU can operate as efficiently as possible on a cost effective and self-funding basis, it is planned to rationalise the 12 existing registration boards listed in the Act, one for each profession, plus any other boards that may be established for newly designated professions, into a reduced number of inter-disciplinary registration boards.  This will require separate primary legislation to be introduced when the registration boards and their registers for the existing designated professions are up and running successfully.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of uniformity between the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and certain provisions of other Acts which regulate medical practitioners, nurses and midwives is driven by the desirability to ensure consistency in the various registration regimes.  The Bill will amend the Act in a number of respects to bring its provisions into line with those of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nursing and Midwives Act 2011.<br\/><br\/>The final objective of this Bill is to address an unintended lacuna in section 19 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, which came to light during the implementation planning phase.  That Act modernised the contributions regimes in a wide range of residential settings so as to better reflect current models of residential care service provision in the disability, mental health and care of older people sectors.  Under the National Disability Strategy and A Vision for Change, there is an ongoing drive towards community-based living in the disability and mental health sectors.  In line with this, the increasing trend, particularly in the disability sector, is for accommodation needs to be met by the agencies of the State, such as local authorities, responsible for addressing the accommodation needs of citizens generally.  However, the 2013 Act unintentionally omitted situations where service users are maintained, although not accommodated, in specified settings by or on behalf of the HSE.  The primary purpose of Part 3 is therefore to ensure that affordable contributions towards ongoing daily living costs will apply to those maintained in such settings, subject to appropriate safeguards.  For example, the level of contribution will be reduced to reflect the extent to which service users meet their accommodation and-or maintenance costs themselves.<br\/><br\/>I now propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  The Bill is divided into 3 Parts.  Part 1 has three sections which provide for the repeal of the Opticians Act 1956 and for the standard provisions relating to Short Title, commencement and expenses.<br\/><br\/>Part 2 contains 37 sections relating to the amendment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  It applies the Act to the professions of optometrist and dispensing optician.  The primary sections in this regard are sections 6, 12, 17, 20, 22, 34 and 36.  It also amends the Act, in sections 6, 12 and 21 of the Bill, to divide, for the purposes of that Act, the designated profession of radiographer into the two designated professions of radiographer and radiation therapist.  Sections 6, 12, 13 and 16 will permit a registration board to regulate two or more designated professions.<br\/><br\/>Amendments to provide for the introduction of uniformity between the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and the Nursing and Midwives Act 2011, and consequential and other technical amendments, comprise the remaining section of the Bill.  The amendments required to align the 2005 Act with the 2007 and 2011 Acts may be broken down into the four main areas of governance, fitness to practice, registration and offences.  The principal governance amendments relate to the election of a deputy chairperson of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the role of the council's chief executive officer, quorums and the holding of certain meetings of the council and registration boards by video link or the circulation of papers.  The Bill amends CORU's fitness to practice regime to allow for: the cancellation of the registration of a registrant convicted of an indictable offence if it is in the public interest to do so, the appointment of persons to assist in investigating complaints against a registrant, the application for immediate suspension of the registration of a registrant on an <i>ex parte<\/i>basis, and the publication of the transcript of the proceedings of a committee of inquiry.  In regard to registration, the Bill provides for the charging of fees for approving education and training programmes and for attaching conditions to the registration of a registrant with a relevant medical disability.  Finally, the Bill modernises the Act's provisions relating to the prosecution of offences and provides the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with new investigation powers similar to those of the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 has four sections which, under subsection 1(3) of the Bill, will come into operation in tandem with section 19 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  The Bill provides, in section 42, for amending section 61A of the Health Act 1970 to define or redefine key terms.  The thrust of the amended definitions provision is to ensure that the statutory contributions regime will cover ongoing essential daily living costs such as food and utility bills where these are met by or on behalf of the HSE, irrespective of whether the service user is accommodated by or on behalf of the HSE.<\/p><p>The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to section 67C of the 1970 Act, including provision for reducing contribution amounts automatically for those maintained but not accommodated by or on behalf of the HSE, Health Service Executive; varying contribution amounts based on service users' income levels and-or levels of dependence or independence; and making appropriate transitional arrangements for the new contributions framework if deemed necessary.<\/p><p> This Bill will modernise the regulation of the optical professions, will ensure all those maintained by the HSE and its agents in specified settings contribute within their means towards their daily living expenses while retaining a reasonable amount of income for personal use, and will enable the Health and Social Care Professionals Council to continue to fulfil, in a more effective way, its objective to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions.<\/p><p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300027#Z01300","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411490700,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I welcome the broad thrust of the first two sections of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014.  The Government, however, has taken the interpretation of &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; to a whole new level in section 3 which covers charges for people who depend on provision of accommodation by the HSE or agents on its behalf.  Fianna F&aacute;il has no difficulty in supporting the first two sections but section 3 leaves much to be desired because of the lack of consultation and discussion with the various stakeholders involved.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Health stated this is not a revenue-raising measure.  The Department, however, also told me last year that it would not have a budget deficit of &euro;500 million.  I must advocate on behalf of people who have the view that section 3 will put charges on a statutory footing that could be increased at a later stage.  The broader issue of this should have been discussed with the Disability Federation of Ireland and other stakeholders who have concerns about these measures.  While the measure contained in section 3 tightens up a lacuna in section 19 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, it should have been put out for discussion among the stakeholders involved.  Not doing so is regrettable.  When we talk about giving people with disabilities a voice in society, the very least we should do is listen to them when such a measure that directly impacts on them is brought before the House.  Section 3 does impact on people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>The Minister stated the Bill&rsquo;s main objective is &ldquo;to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of the designated professions&rdquo;.  We welcome this streamlining and the advances being made in the regulation of professional medical bodies, as well as them being open to the need for the public to have full confidence in such regulation.  There is also the need to ensure continual training and education in these professions, as well as sanction in the event of codes of conduct being breached.<br\/><br\/>For a long time, some of our professions may seem to have had a vaulted position in society and been considered above the law.  Critically, as people take more ownership of their health needs, the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>is that the medical professions must be obligated to respond in ensuring adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the appropriate conduct of their members.  This also applies to education and continual learning because of the advances taking place in medicine in general.<br\/><br\/>As we are dealing with miscellaneous provisions in this Bill, I want to raise another broader issue, one to which we have referred on several occasions as did the former Minister for Health, of medical professionals who have been declared bankrupt such as pharmacists, for example.  A commitment had been given that this issue would be addressed.  I cannot understand why a pharmacist, if deemed bankrupt, cannot practise.  I can understand the pharmacist being debarred from the business aspect but not from practising.  Discussions were meant to have taken place to address this particular issue in the short term.  Will the Minister inform me how the Department is dealing with this matter?  The professionals involved are highly qualified and are meant to be used more in the provision of community-based medical care.  This is an area that needs to be examined and the former Minister for Health said he was of like mind with others who raised this issue.<br\/><br\/>This Bill highlights the complexity of our health services and the number of health care professionals delivering care in our communities.  This leads to challenges, particularly for administration managers and policymakers.  As we see health care evolve and become more complex in many ways, equally we need to ensure there are simple and transparent ways for people to bring about complaints and not to be afraid to do so.  Organisations overseeing the medical professions must also not be afraid to be seen to acting on complaints.  Most people who have a concern or complaint about a medical professional will want it ventilated and investigated.  For many years, many health professions swept complaints under the carpet which has led us down some unfortunate pathways in some incidents.  I hope the norm will be the investigation of people&rsquo;s complaints.  This will enhance the integrity of health professionals as they will stand up to scrutiny and adjudication by their peers.  This will ensure the public has full confidence in all health care professions.<br\/><br\/>Returning to section 3, the Bill provides that statutory contributions are payable by recipients of residential support services who, while maintained, are not directly accommodated by or on behalf of the HSE.  Being maintained by the HSE means the cost of food, utility bills and other household essentials are met by the executive or its agents.  However, the Department has no estimates available of the numbers likely to be affected by this measure.  I find that a little strange.  The Minister claims no extra costs or no extra charges will be incurred but it will still affect people involved as this provision will be placed on a statutory footing when this legislation passes.  It would be nice to know how many people could be affected.  The people most likely to be impacted are older people and those with physical, mental or intellectual disabilities or care needs who are living in accommodation provided by housing authorities or local authorities and who receive residential support services from the HSE or its agents.<\/p><p>That is a critically important point because moving services into the community will become more prevalent in future.  I have genuine concerns that increased charges will arise.  In some nursing homes people did not receive the full range of treatments they required such as physiotherapy and other supports.  The Department of Health, the HSE, HIQA and others must monitor the situation to ensure people receive their entitlements and the necessary supports to address their health needs.  In some cases there is no clear oversight or lines of obligation for the provision of ancillary care services.<\/p><p> I recently spoke to a person in a nursing home who informed me that consultant geriatricians seldom visit nursing homes.  We still have a long way to go to develop proper community services where the care professionals go into the community and meet their patients in their home as opposed to the reverse always being the case, which requires people to traipse in and out of hospitals continually.  I accept such an approach requires resources but it would also free up resources if people did not have to visit hospitals continually.  We should change the traffic flow and get health care professionals into communities.  That should be easily done in the context of nursing home care as patients are in a defined place.  I heard recently that it is very difficult to get a GP to visit a nursing home out of hours.  I accept that is a challenge but we must put a strong emphasis on addressing the situation as such cases turn into emergencies requiring an ambulance and a visit to an accident and emergency department.  That is not good for the individual or for the system as it ties up scarce resources in an already challenging environment.  That is an area about which I have concerns.<\/p><p> People could be discouraged from opting for care in the community rather than in a residential setting.  The financial contribution required could discourage some people from moving from a residential setting to a community setting.  The Disability Federation of Ireland is concerned that the situation could adversely impact on those accessing respite care services for a period, which would place an extra strain on carers.  It is estimated that family carers provide vital, unpaid support to people with disabilities in their homes every day, thus saving the Exchequer considerable sums of money.  Periods of rest and time to oneself can be rare occurrences for family carers but it is essential for many family carers to maintain their health and well-being, therefore enabling them to continue to provide care to a loved one at home.  The amounts that could be charged could push people with disabilities further into deprivation or back into institutions, as they would no longer be able to afford to live or socialise in the community.  The view was expressed to me by disability advocacy groups.  It would have been preferable to have allowed time in advance of the Bill coming to the D&aacute;il for discussion between stakeholders and the relevant sections in the Department, the HSE and others on their concerns about the impact of the proposed changes.  Their concerns could well have been alleviated or in some way addressed in the legislation.<\/p><p> The national disability strategy and the Disability Act established a new framework for disability services with the aim of supporting equal participation in society for people with disabilities.  If they are paying higher charges, however, they will not be able to afford to participate.  What I say is not a reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, or the office she holds, but we all know what will happen once a charge is introduced.  There is an inevitable creep in the system which continually creeps in only one direction.  Charges are seldom reduced.  It is a concern for many that once a charge is statutorily introduced, the contributions sought could increase incrementally over a period.  Most people with disabilities face considerable challenges in terms of personal development, job opportunities and financially.  In the context of the Bill, we would oppose anything that would place further burdens on them.  The miscellaneous provisions outlined are varied and disparate and it would be remiss of me to allow the Bill to be introduced without highlighting the issues of concern.<\/p><p> On the broader issue of health and the challenges facing it, the Minister of State is aware of the recent figures on waiting lists for outpatient appointments.  Those who are on waiting lists for urgent procedures are being told they will be seen within 22 to 24 months for knee replacements and hip replacements.  The challenges are considerable.  Budgets are set at the start of the year.  The Chamber is known for its latitude in many ways and the Acting Chairman, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is particularly known for her generosity in that regard.  We must be honest about the health service.  We cannot pretend we can give everything to everyone in the State and that it will not cost them anything.  It is probably time for political parties and people in general together to come up with an honest approach to the health service.  The proposed model for universal health insurance was not workable.  Even those who drafted it must have known deep down that it was merely designed to get the Government over a particular hurdle.  We have gone past that stage and we now face a situation where the health service is unsure of the funding model that underpins it.  The notion that we can have a health service that will limp along, unsure of which direction to take, which funding model will underpin it or the principles that govern it in terms of who can access it, who will pay for it and who can get it are key components of an honest and timely debate on the direction of the health service.  We cannot have a situation whereby this time next year we will have another budget deficit of &euro;500 million and pressure on care professionals, especially at the coalface of the health service.<\/p><p> Nurses protested about patient safety outside a hospital in Galway recently and there was another protest in Limerick.  Nurses elsewhere have expressed considerable concern at the impact of the cuts on patient safety.  Nurses are health professionals whose obligation is to provide care in a safe, meaningful and efficient manner.  We must listen to them when they say they are unable to do that.  All the governance and structures in place stand for nothing if the Government does not support them in terms of resourcing them to ensure they can comply with their own high standards, the high standards expected of them by others, and the high standards the public deserve.  The key issue is to ensure front-line services, in the context of some of the people proposed to be governed under the Bill, can operate in a safe environment.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, referred to oversight by HIQA and others.  From time to time HIQA must observe the pressure on front-line staff in emergency departments.  Nurses in Galway are being given assistance to cope with work related stress.  That is how difficult health care professionals find the situation on the front line.  In the context of best practice, continuing professional development and oversight, we must ensure professionals operate within clear defined guidelines and maintain very high standards.<\/p><p>It is critical that we support them when we ask them to do this.  When we ask them to do so in legislation they are under an obligation so they should be helped with resources and supports.  That is a debate for another day but it seems to me that everyone in this Chamber pretends he or she has the solutions to the challenges that face us in the area of health.  We do not have all the solutions but we need a collective observation on the health system we seek, how it will be funded and the services it will provide.  Who pays for health care and who receives it?  Will everyone be entitled to universality or will contributions vary depending on a person's resources and needs?  Will we encourage private health insurance?  Is private health insurance integral to the public system or is it separate?<\/p><p> Nobody has all the solutions but producing a document prior to an election is merely pretence - and that applies to all parties.  Five-point plans, seven-point plans and key lines throw health services into upheaval yet we expect a service to be delivered.  This is not good enough as 100,000 people work in the health sector and 4.3 million people depend on it in various ways.  We cannot simply lead the health service into a cul-de-sac and reverse out when we find it is blocked because that is not a sustainable way to deliver health care in this country.  Even the best will of the professionals governed by this legislation, other legislation and various overseeing bodies does not allow them to operate properly in this environment.<\/p><p> GPs and nurses are under pressure to deliver in the community primary care setting, as are front-line staff in the emergency services.  These are all key areas and we must respond quickly and collectively to the cries for support and help.  Many nurses already need help to deal with work pressure and GPs are leaving the country in droves.  I am not exaggerating - this is the reality of what is happening outside Leinster House.  I know the Minister of State is not immune to this observation as she sees this every day.  This matter must be addressed quickly.<\/p><p> The budget will be published on 15 October and it will outline some form of funding until the end of this year.  I hope it will give us a chance of making it to the end of 2015 with a reasonable financial package that is realistic, achievable and sustainable, as opposed to the pretence that was offered last year and in previous years.  I could go back further but such arguments are for another day.<\/p><p> We can speak of statutory registration, regulation, oversight and insisting on the appropriate behaviour of health care professionals but this must be done in the presumption that such professionals will be supported in their duties with proper and fair resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300030#CC00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411491900,"counter":343,"content":"<p>This is the first health-related Bill of the new session and I welcome the Minister of State but I wonder when the Minister for Health will make his opening contribution.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum indicates the Bill's main purpose is to subsume Bord na Radharcmhast&oacute;ir&iacute;, the Opticians Board, into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, divide the designated profession of radiographer into two designated professions of radiographer and radiation therapist and ensure that statutory contributions are payable by recipients of residential support services who are maintained, though not directly accommodated, by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>  I have been contacted by the Association of Optometrists Ireland - I am sure this applies to everyone here - and they are in broad support of the section dealing with eye care.  That this bill will facilitate increased care at primary level is to be welcomed.  The fact that all parties to this proposed change have been consulted is also to be welcomed.  I note also that the Department of Health patient safety committee has acknowledged that there is no risk to patient safety if Bord na Radharcmhast&oacute;ir&iacute; is subsumed into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council.<\/p><p>  I have also received correspondence from the Federation of (Ophthalmic and Dispensing) Opticians Ireland, which represents eye care providers and registered opticians in business in Ireland.  While they are supportive of an update to the Act of 1956 they are concerned about sections 81A and 81B of the draft Bill.  These sections state that spectacles may only be dispensed or sold by a registered medical practitioner or a registrant of the designated profession of optometrist of dispensing optician.  The members of the federation inform me that currently, while optometrists conduct eye examinations and prescriptions are dispensed by dispensing opticians, they are often assisted by other trained members of staff with tasks such as the selection of frames and the processing of payments.  I have been through the process a number of times in my life.  They say that the result of these sections is that current practice would be prohibited.  The members of the federation see current practice as both safe and an efficient use of skilled time.  They are also concerned that if these sections remain in the Bill they could lead to restrictions on access to eye care, including sight tests, an increase in costs for members and the taxpayer and an increase in prices for the patient.  I raise these matters on Second Stage because I believe they need to be addressed by the Minister and the Department.  I hope my points receive responses when the Minister of State responds to this debate.<\/p><p>  To require an optometrist or a dispensing optician to conduct the entire sale, they say, would be a poor use of the time of a clinically skilled professional.  They also say that this very specific requirement is not something that is specified in the cases of other clinical professions regulated by CORU.  I therefore seek clarification as to whether the Bill allows registered optometrists or dispensing opticians to delegate certain non-clinical functions of the dispense, for example the selection of frames, and the sale of spectacles to suitably qualified staff working under their supervision.  Some people buy non-prescription spectacles off the shelf so there is a need to clarify the impact and intent of the sections mentioned.<\/p><p> This is the first Bill to be brought forward in the new Minister's term.  I had intended stating \"by the new Minister\" but this apparently is not the case.  Much has changed, it appears, in Government policy since his arrival.  Gone are some of the core objectives of the former Minister and in their place we have but guarantees of a continuing - with respect - unfair two-tier health system.  I note that to date six registration boards have been established for social workers, radiographers, dietitians, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  It is a great pity that these are among the very same services the Government has targeted for cutbacks.  Sadly, it is the most vulnerable in society who are most affected by the cuts introduced in the years of austerity under the former Fianna F&aacute;il Government, and continued and deepened by the Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition.  The very young and those who have lived longer lives, those with disabilities and those in under-resourced and deprived areas already at a disadvantage see supports continually chipped away.<\/p><p> I further note that no mention is made of the remaining professions of the 12 that had previously been designated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, specifically the roles of clinical biochemist, medical scientist, orthoptist, podiatrist, and psychologist.  I ask the Minister of State for an update on the development of a framework for the regulation of these professions.  If she put it on the record in her opening contribution, I apologise.  The debate started way ahead of the signalled time on my schedule-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300032#EE00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411492500,"counter":345,"content":"<p>It took me by surprise also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300033#FF00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1411492500,"counter":346,"content":"<p>-----and I missed what she had to say.  I have the text of her contribution and I will take the time to study it afterwards.  If any of the points I have made were not covered in it, I ask that they be addressed in the closing contribution on Second Stage.<br\/><br\/>The second part of the Bill divides the designated profession of radiographer into two separate professions of radiographer and radiation therapist.  There is an important difference and I welcome this development as something that will be to the benefit of patients and also to what will be the two stand-alone recognised professions of radiographer and radiation therapist.  These roles have different focuses and I believe that such a division will aid in ensuring the roles keep up with developments internationally along with aiding transparency ,and will further improve patient care.<br\/><br\/>That the Bill will allow the cancellation of registration of a registrant convicted of an indictable offence if it is in the public interest is to be welcomed.  Indeed, it is unfortunate that this has not been a part of legislation to date.  I also welcome the provision for the appointment of persons to aid investigations and immediate suspension on an <i>ex parte<\/i>basis.  The publication of the transcript of the proceedings of a committee of inquiry, a new departure, will add to transparency and will help to increase the public's trust in CORU and in the provision of multidisciplinary health care.  It is to be hoped this will avoid the lack of transparency and <i>omerta<\/i>that was seen in representative bodies in the past and will not lead us into future health care scandals in which the public is kept in the dark following an injury to one or more of our number.  The horrors of the Michael Neary scandal or the symphysiotomy scandal come to my mind, and they must press us to demand a better standard of care and more speedy access to redress in the health sphere.<br\/><br\/>The Health and Social Care Professionals Council will be given new investigative powers similar to those of the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  While the vast majority of those represented by Health and Social Care Professionals Council are, without question, diligent, hard-working and caring individuals, the public must, nevertheless, be protected from rogue practitioners and those whose standard of care is not up to scratch, or even in some cases dangerous to the general population.<br\/><br\/>Reducing contribution amounts that cover essential daily living costs for those maintained by, or on behalf of, but not accommodated by the HSE, is concerning to me and to many Deputies in the House.  I would be worried that this might be an effort to reduce supports in general.  The Bill tells us that amounts of contribution would be varied, based on income levels of service users and-or levels of dependence or independence, as the case might be.  This passage most certainly needs clarification as it is open to interpretation.  It could lead to a Minister - I will not say &quot;the Minister&quot; - deciding that some or many of those receiving support would no longer qualify for it, either in part or in full.<br\/><br\/>In summary, I support the principal thrust of the Bill, certainly with regard to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act.  Much of its substance focuses on the necessary regulation of health care practitioners but, unfortunately, as I have said and intended for the Minister of State's senior colleague if he were here, many of these are among the practices that have been so severely hit by recent years of Government-driven cutbacks.  I would have urged him, as I urge the Minister of State, to ensure these are matters of serious and immediate address.<br\/><br\/>To encapsulate the key points which I believe need clarification, I seek clarification whether the Bill allows registered optometrists or dispensing opticians to delegate certain non-clinical functions of the dispense to suitably qualified staff, as is the case at present.  I reflect on the provision for a reduction in contribution supports to cover essential daily living costs for people with physical or intellectual disabilities.  If it is, as I fear, it needs to be removed.  If it is not as it suggests at first reading, I ask for detailed clarification on how it is to be interpreted and how it will work out in real terms.  These points merit the Minister of State's attention and clarification and I look forward to hearing what she has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300033#FF00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1411492500,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this new legislation.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State is in the Chamber to listen to the views of various Members.  We all have one thing in common, despite some political differences, which is that we all want a quality health service with standards and professionalism.  We should all unite in the debate on funding for the health services.  I strongly welcome any important debate on our health system, in particular on reforming our health service.  The Bill is about standards and professionalism.  These words jump out at one when one reads the legislation.  We must make them real and meaningful and relate them to people's lives.  We have a long way to go with regard to standards, professionalism and resources.<\/p><p>  The number of people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments increased by 158 in August.  This is appalling and not good enough.  It is not acceptable.<\/p><p>How can we talk about standards and professionalism when this type of activity takes place on the front line in our accident and emergency departments?  That is a key part of this debate as well.  The Minister of State should not come into the House and say everything is fine, the economy is booming and growth is back in business when there has been an increase of 158 of patients lying on trolleys in hospitals in August.  It is time to get real and bring in the resources and reforms we all support.<\/p><p> We need to stuff the tax-cuts brigade until we help the sick, the elderly and the disabled.  That is a debate that will go on in coming weeks regarding the budget.  In any economy in any civilised society that was ravaged by recession and rampant greed where resources are slim, one must give it to the neediest.  That must be a key aspect if one is in here today addressing health issues.  That is a tough decision for the Government.  It can throw out tax cuts to the wealthy and yet it cannot find the extra resources and finances to look after the sick, the elderly, the disabled and our senior citizens on trolleys in hospitals such as Beaumont.  That must be challenged and these are the kinds of tough decisions that need to be made.  These are important key elements of this legislation.<\/p><p> The main purpose of the Bill to subsume the Opticians Board into the Health and Social Care Council.  It makes certain amendments to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 in the interests of efficiency and to ensure consistency with the legislation governing health regulators.  It also amends the Health Act 1970 to ensure that statutory contributions are payable by recipients of residential support services, who, while maintained, are not directly accommodated by or on behalf of the HSE.  That is what is going on in this legislation.  There are positive elements to it and I would also be very constructive regarding the Bill.<\/p><p> The Health and Social Care Council, which I will refer to as the council, is an independent regulator established to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among registrants of 12 designated health and social care professions.  That is what the council is all about.  The objective of the council is a key aspect regarding the build-up and debate on the health service.  The objective of the council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence among the registrants of the designated professions.<\/p><p> To date, six registration boards have been established for the professions of social worker, radiographer, dietician, speech and language therapist, occupational therapist and physiotherapist.  It is planned to have all these 12 boards and the registers established by 2015.  I welcome that six have already been established which is a positive development.  I hope we achieve that target by 2015.<\/p><p> When one looks at the details of it, one finds we are talking about professions such as social worker.  We now have a crisis with dysfunctional children and children at risk and yet we also have a problem with social workers.  We need people to be involved in these front-line services.  We all know there are waiting lists but we have to prioritise kids' situations.  In particular abused children and children at risk need to be at the top of the political agenda.<\/p><p> The Minister of State should not come in here and tell us the economy is achieving 5% growth if the Government is not going to look after those vulnerable children.  If one does not intervene when they are between four and ten years of age, they will all end up in Mountjoy Prison, robbing taxi drivers in Cork or beating people up in the streets because their dysfunction and abuse was neglected when they were between the ages of four and ten.  Most sensible people, whether one is a social worker, an education psychologist or a backbench politician, will say that is the reality.  Therefore the social workers have to be given priority.<\/p><p> An issue that has come up in recent days is the scandal of the shortage of positions and children on waiting lists for speech and language therapists.  This is something we have to deal with.  Children should be given these services as a right.  If it means more tax, so be it, but one has to pay for the services.<\/p><p> I would like to broaden the debate because I mentioned social workers and speech and language therapists, and there are also occupational therapists.  There is also the broader issue, which is the main part of the Minister of State's brief, and that is the issue of disabilities.  We need to ensure we have high professional standards for all children and adults with a physical or intellectual disability.  We have examples of good practice in the State as I know from first hand from my experience of my family situation.  There are some excellent service providers in the State doing an excellent job, but we also need to plug the gaps and give those, who do not have them, an adequate service.<\/p><p> For example, many people do not realise that the census in 2011 recorded 595,355 people as having a disability, equivalent to 13% of the population.  At least one in ten adults of working age of 15 to 64 has a disability.  Disability increases sharply with age.  Just 5.4% of children under 15 have a disability compared with 38% of those over 65 years.  This is linked into the debate about the standard and professionalism of this debate on the whole council issue.<\/p><p> Some 68% of people who use disability services are not satisfied with the level of control they have over their own lives.  I accept this is about to change and that debate is going on and hopefully it will change.  Some 40% are also dissatisfied with the quality of services being provided.  The 60% I mentioned earlier are satisfied and, in fairness, they are getting a good service which I commend.  However, if we are talking about reform, change and resources, we need to focus on the 40% who are not satisfied.<\/p><p> Some 13,655 applications for disability allowance were turned down last year, which represents a refusal rate of 55%.  The Minister of State might say they are trying it on.  The reality is that 58% of the appeals were later accepted.  My point is that these people should not be punished or penalised for their disability.  Almost 4,000 people with disabilities were in need of social housing in 2013.<\/p><p> This goes back to the issue with speech and language service.  More than 32,000 children remained on waiting lists for speech and language assessments and interventions at the end of 2013.  In 2013, some 15,830 people were waiting for assessment by an occupational therapist, with 2,500 waiting for more than a year, including 1,900 children.  I am giving the facts and the reality.  We know we cannot do it overnight, but we should prioritise certain issues.<\/p><p> We also have to face the reality that many people with disabilities have also been caught, particularly over the four or five years of austerity and they experience higher rates of poverty, for example.  That is a figure that has been ignored - people with disabilities in poverty.  Families where the head of the household is not at work due to illness or disability have the lowest average annual disposable income in the region of &euro;21,492 - an 11% drop since 2010.  Individuals who are not at work due to illness or disability endure some of the highest levels of consistent poverty at 17.6%.  This overshadows the national figure of 7.7%.<\/p><p> Some 48.5% of people not at work due to illness or disability are at risk of deprivation, in contrast to the national average of 26.9%.  This means that they struggle with the cost of adequate clothing and heating and cannot afford to eat a meal with fish or meat every second day.  That is the reality.  I am bringing this into the debate because we are talking about standards, professionalism and the work this council will do to upskill and ensure that standards are met.<\/p><p> Just 24.5% of people with disabilities have completed third level education compared with 38.7% of the general population.  Some 16.3% of people with disabilities aged between 15 and 49 have completed no higher than their primary education, compared with 5.1% for the general population of the same age.<\/p><p>Included within that figure are people with intellectual disabilities but there also are people with a physical disability who are extremely bright and intelligent.  I again refer to my experience as a councillor on Dublin City Council.  In 1999, our target was to try to get the figure of staff with disabilities up to 5% and I remember we exceeded that target in one year.  It showed that a lot of talented people in IT and in administration who had a physical disability came into work in Dublin City Council and made a massive contribution to the city of Dublin and the development and running of Dublin City Councils services.<br\/><br\/>My point is that Members must be radical, creative and compassionate and must show leadership.  Only 20.7% of people with disabilities aged 15 and over are in employment, while the equivalent figure rises to 50% for the general population of the same age.  The unemployment rate for people with disabilities stands at 30.8%, which is significantly greater than the current figure of 11% for the general public.  There also of course have been the hits in budget 2014, including a 15% cut to the weekly invalidity pension, a reduction of &euro;5 million in expenditure on the supplementary payments, cuts of &euro;44 per week to jobseeker's allowance, the abolition of the telephone allowance and seeking of &euro;2.1 million in savings through exceptional needs payments.  These issues affected people with disabilities and I raise them because they are important and because one must go back to standards and to the work that is set out.<br\/><br\/>I will return to the detailed provisions of the legislation, which makes reference to amendments to the Health Act 1970 in respect of statutory contributions.  The Bill aims to ensure that statutory contributions are payable by recipients of residential support services who are maintained, though not directly accommodated, by or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Being maintained by the HSE means the cost of food, utility bills and other household essentials is met by the HSE or its agents.  While there are no estimates available of the numbers affected, this group is likely to comprise older people and people with physical, mental or intellectual disabilities or care needs who are living in accommodation provided by housing authorities or local authorities or who receive residential support services from the HSE and its agents.  Residential support services vary greatly, based on client need, and may include care assistance, supervision, house-parenting, psychological and nursing services.  I urge the Minister to give priority to these services in the build-up to the budget.<br\/><br\/>I note the figures for the waiting lists for residential places, day places and respite care are not very big and consequently, they could be targeted and dealt with effectively.  A radical Minister for Health could solve this issue pertaining to residential and day care because I read recently that in some places, the numbers were 300 to 340 and while there was a big figure in the region of 1,100, these still are issues we can attempt to solve.  I urge the Minister, as well as every party in the D&aacute;il, to prioritise these people.  Examples of good practice are available, as are examples of high standards.  Moreover, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is aware, there also are examples whereby some of these service providers during the bad times really maintained services against the odds and managed their money sensibly.  I have seen some outstanding services and people availing of some of them did not mind paying a contribution for respite in order to pay for the poorer families in respite.  Some chief executives of such services took a highly inclusive approach with the parents.  I happen to be a parent of a daughter who is in the Prosper Fingal services, which has a young team of staff who, although they are nailed to the wall, are doing a fantastic job against the odds.  My point to the Minister of State is that examples of good practice are available.  They should be given a leg up and, where possible, there should be a focus on these issues and the delivery of the services.  This is an important point.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Health has stated that the new system is not intended as a revenue-raising measure, which I welcome.  It is understood that most of those affected already are contributing towards their maintenance and accommodation costs.  Under the Health Act 1970, the daily contribution will not exceed 80% of the maximum daily rate of the State pension (non-contributory).  The Bill provides for waivers in certain circumstances, including to avoid undue financial hardship on the person concerned or his or her dependents.  These are the positive aspects of this legislation and are the issues about which Members must agree on a commonsense idea and must decide to adopt it.  I will support this and make no apologies for so doing.  However, as part of my support, I urge the Government and the Minister to focus on the priority issues.  They should not come into this Chamber every second day like the comedian who came into the Chamber earlier, namely, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who was telling jokes about the economy.  The bottom line is if the economy is growing, that is fine but one must focus on providing services.  Moreover, the State must prioritise its money and it is easy to jump up and down stating one wishes to give tax cuts to those people and further tax cuts to those who are well off.  Any humane, sensitive and compassionate Government must first acknowledge it is aware that people want this and that everybody needs a break.  It should accept the point about middle income and low-paid workers who, God knows, have suffered enough in recent years.  However, there are certain times in life when one must make tough decisions and they must be to support the weaker sections of society.  This must be the entire theme in respect of this legislation today.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the details in the legislation providing for the dissolution of the Opticians Board.  The section looks at the dissolution of the aforementioned board, the transfer of staff, transfer of property and liabilities to the council, preservation of contracts, pending legal proceedings and preparation of accounts.  I am a little concerned by the section pertaining to the transfer of staff and a red light has gone on in this regard but perhaps the Minister of State can deal with it later.  It provides that every person who, immediately before the relevant day, was a member of the staff of the Opticians Board is, on the relevant day, transferred to, and becomes a member of, the council&rsquo;s staff.  I welcome this provision.  Moreover, a person transferred under this section is entitled, while in the council&rsquo;s service, to be employed on conditions of employment no less favourable than those to which that person was entitled immediately before the relevant day.  The previous service of a person transferred under this section with the Opticians Board is to be counted as service for the purposes of, but subject to any exceptions or exclusions in, certain Acts, including the Redundancy Payments Acts, the Protection of Employees Acts and the Unfair Dismissals Acts.<br\/><br\/>As for the number of people affected by these issues, I believe there are no estimates available of the number of people likely to be affected by the changes proposed in the Bill.  The Department has stated: &quot;Unfortunately, the HSE does not collate information at present in a manner which facilitates quantification or reliable estimation of the numbers likely to be affected by the amendments in Part 3 of the Bill&quot;.  This is also an issue Members must watch because this pertains to standards, effectiveness, accountability and reform.  Members should remember they all were elected in 2011, when all promised reform following the shenanigans, everything that had gone on and the way in which things happened.  On the doorsteps, all Members promised reform.  My point to the Minister of State today is that part of reform is about being realistic.  Anyone working in the health service will say that one cannot effect reform without money.  As for those Members who come into this Chamber and state that expenditure in the health service is out of control, they do not realise but must understand that the health service is a service; it is not a private company or business and things change overnight.  For example, last nights &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme highlighted the question of those families affected by hepatitis C.  Those concerned need a drug to keep them alive and I believe the figures quoted were for more than &euro;300 million.  However, the bottom line is Members must pull back and must ask what, as a country and as a society, are the priorities.  The point I make is that when one has limited resources, one must give them to the priority cases.  Although this will not be popular with some people, I must state that I was shocked by a recent poll in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  I was having a go at the tax-cut brigade and my position was that were a few extra bob available, they should be put into services.  I thought I would get hammered but in the aforementioned <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>poll, when asked, 61% of people stated that were an additional few million euro available, the money should be put into services and the resources should be provided.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, also should focus on this point that support exists in this regard.  Everyone accepts she is trying to do this internally and people are aware that in their hearts, those who work in the health services are trying to provide a quality health service.<br\/><br\/>People are also aware that there must be reform, efficiencies and accountability and that they cannot spend their lives slagging off the medical profession, including doctors and consultants.  I acknowledge so doing might sound good in the newspapers.<\/p><p>However, I have a major concern in light of the &euro;100,000 or so of taxpayers' money that is given over to training each young doctor in UCC, NUIG, UCD and so on, when, as soon as their training is complete, so many end up going off to Australia or the United States to work.  It might not be popular to mention Cuba in this Chamber - colleagues seem to have gone mad lately in their support of the US - but what happens there is instructive.  When I visited the country some years ago I met a group of medical students who told me how, after finishing their training, they were obliged to give two years service to poor communities in the villages and mountains, providing GP, midwifery and a range of other services.  On another occasion, in a pub in Havana, I met another gang of medical students who were working, during their summer holidays, with the poorest families and communities.<\/p><p> This is a country that has been hammered by the embargo imposed by the bully boys in the US.  I do not know what the Americans are up to, but I wish to God they would leave the Cuban people alone.  However, that is another debate.  The point of this example is to show what is happening in a very poor country that is being tortured by a US embargo.  I attended a disability centre during my visit there and saw the disability provision that operates from cradle to grave.  Every child with an intellectual disability is guaranteed a service from day of birth to day of death.  We have far more resources than some of the countries already providing the type of modern, accessible and progressive health service our citizens deserve.  <\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and the measures it contains.  When it comes to health service provision, we should take a cross-party approach.  The universal support for the NHS in Scotland was very evident during the campaign leading up to the independence referendum.  I am very sorry for the voters for whom the result was a disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that all parties were committed to protecting the NHS.  Some even spoke about how to make a better NHS.  I would like to see a united approach in this country which acknowledges that there are certain things in life which we as a society and country must protect, namely, a good-quality health service and a good-quality education service.  One can build a country and a society from those foundations.  If we look after our sick, elderly and disabled, we will have a better country and a better quality of life for the people who live here.  The Minister for Finance and his departmental whizz kids might not agree, but early intervention will, in the long term, see substantial savings in the provision of health services.  I referred earlier to children being raised in very dysfunctional and violent families.  We must intervene early in such circumstances and prevent their ending up in Mountjoy Prison some years down the road.<\/p><p> I hope the Minister of State takes on board the points we have made today.  I urge her to keep fighting in the coming weeks for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.  These people deserve services as a right, not as a charitable act.  The parents of children with disabilities pay taxes and are entitled to a service.  Nobody complains about the cost of sending little Johnny to the local national school, but there is plenty of whinging when parents of children with disabilities are looking for speech therapy and other services.  We must break down that mindset.  I welcome the legislation, but urge the Minister to give consideration to these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300033#FF00400","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411494300,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill, whose aim is to enhance the health protection of the public.  I was not around for the debate on the Opticians Act 1956, which this Bill will replace, or the Health Act 1970, which it amends.  I was here, however, for both the passing of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 and the publication of the health strategy in 2001 which was the impetus for that legislation.  I recall the importance attached to the passing of that Act in terms of its affording important information and protection to patients and giving them certainty that the health professionals caring for them had participated in recognised training and qualification courses and had reached and maintained a certain standard and fitness to practise, as overseen and enforced by a statutorily specified body.  That such statutory safeguards are necessary is beyond question and I very much welcome the amendments and additions proposed in the Bill we are discussing today, which will enhance the safeguards in the original legislation.<\/p><p>  Sick people have always been easy prey for charlatans.  In fact, that has never been more the case than today, when we, more than any previous generation, are obsessed with health, fitness and diet and the pursuit of a longer and better quality of life.  This is not a bad thing, but it does leave people open to the influence of quackery, mountebanks and very dubious medicine in a whole range of areas, from the magic diet that will give one the perfect figure to offers of foolproof cancer cures.  Moreover, the Internet, which is now available to everybody, greatly facilitates this.  It is understandable that people who are desperately ill or unhappy want to believe there is a cure for their ills.  It is not something for which we can comprehensively legislate, because no legislation can protect people entirely or prevent them from accessing such doubtful services.<\/p><p>  I am not suggesting that because a service is not regulated it is necessarily bad, but there are some services which are so important they must be regulated.  I was appalled recently, in the aftermath of the Y case, to see fly postering all over Dublin advertising a website for the purchase of abortion pills.  Abortifacients are not of themselves dangerous, but they can be both dangerous and ineffective if taken without proper supervision and information, if not taken at the right time, or if taken by persons who have no access to after care, if such is necessary.  This particular issue is not entirely relevant to the Bill before us this evening, but it is an example of the types of practices to which people who are desperate will resort and which are facilitated by the Internet.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Deputy Dan Neville, has frequently raised concerns regarding the lack of regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists offering various services, particularly to people who are at risk of suicide.  I have regularly had flyers through my door offering services to both adults and children.  The persons advertising these service may well be properly qualified, but it is difficult to know for sure.  Before anybody is allowed to go mucking around with the minds of people who are unwell and vulnerable, there should be a way of ascertaining whether they are suitably qualified to do so.  People seeking these services should know how to access providers who are competent and whose qualifications are recognised.  As I said, it may be that most of these people are qualified, but the point is that we do not know.  I understand there are moves afoot which would allow this group to reach agreement on the standards and qualifications necessary to allow members to assign themselves part of a designated group of professionals, so members of the public will know where to go to access these services.  The Minister of State might elaborate on that.<\/p><p>  On the other hand, there is always a danger when setting standards to regulate any profession or allow access to a profession that such regulation becomes so prescriptive as to create a restrictive practice or anti-competitive situation.  In fact, that has been in the case in the health sector in the past, with some professionals acting as gatekeeper to their services or the services of others in the profession.  The Minister of State might recall the fight put up by opticians some years ago when pressure was applied to them to end their monopoly on the sale of reading glasses.  I assume that monopoly was protected in law at the time, but we can be thankful that the same no longer applies and people can now buy what is essentially a pair of magnifying glasses at a reduced price from a range of outlets.<\/p><p>I am very glad to be able to buy them cheaply.  The work opticians do is vital and specific but it is no reason they should be the gatekeeper to buying what is just a magnifying glass.  I mention this because there is an onus on the council and on registration boards to be wary of these kinds of practices, even down to the setting registration fees, lest they also become a barrier to entry.  After all, the idea is not to protect the professions but to protect the public.  The public interest should be paramount in all the deliberations and determinations of the council and the registration boards.<\/p><p> While the thrust of these provisions and the parent Act is to protect the public, there are two enormous benefits to the professionals themselves whose titles are being protected.  They will not, for instance, find their careers being undermined by individuals who have not gone through the same training, who do not have the same qualifications and who have not obtained the same standards as they have.  Once their profession is registered, people cannot just come in and set up without registering and having the recognised qualification.  This is recognised by the various professionals because they have always been anxious to have statutory backing for their specialty and, indeed, we have had representations for further specialties.  <\/p><p> If I remember correctly, this designation of professions facilitates compliance with an EU directive which allows mutual recognition of qualifications of those who are designated.  This gives a huge benefit to the professions because it gives them ease of mobility and they can practice across the 28 EU countries.  It is a benefit to the HSE in that when there is a shortage in a particular profession, it can go abroad and know that the standard of those it recruits in the EU is of a similar standard.<\/p><p> The 2005 legislation anticipated that further professions would join the registration system, beyond the initial 12 designated.  The legislation was flexible enough to facilitate that and what is happening now, that is, the inclusion of opticians, with a single board registering the two branches of the profession.  The same split is being accommodated for radiographers, which is right, because clearly they are two very different specialties.  I am surprised it was not recognised initially because it is something that requires very different qualifications and it is right they should be registered separately and be subject to different standards.<\/p><p> There are other aspects of the legislation which give new powers to the registration boards - for instance, to suspend members of the profession when they are under investigation, if it is in the public interest to do so, and to cancel registration if they have been indicted of particular offences, again if it is in the public interest to do so.  That is essential.  One must be able to enforce standards.  There is no point having standards if one cannot enforce them, so they are welcome additions to the powers of the registration boards.<\/p><p> There is a new power to add conditions to certain professionals if, for instance, they are suffering from a mental or physical disability of some sort.  That is reasonable.  It should not be black and white where one is struck off if one has a disability.  People can do a job to a certain standard.  I am glad that flexibility is included.<\/p><p> If I have a criticism it is the inordinately long time it has taken to implement the 2005 Act.  I am not laying this at the Minister's door because it goes back over several Governments.  This Bill is the second legislative change to the Act.  For all intents and purposes, the Act has not yet been implemented.  It took a while to get the boards in place but at this stage, we should be looking at a situation where all the boards should be at least registering the professions.  As long as this goes on, the potential of the Act to protect the public is unrealised and there can be no mechanism in place to deal with fitness to practice complaints.  The key to this kind of legislation is that the standards set are enforced.  If that is not possible, there is no point setting standards at all.  It is time for this legislation to be implemented and to be up and running.  I hope this additional legislation will act as a spur to action, so that at least we can get all of the professionals registered and operating.<\/p><p> I refer to the section on statutory contributions because this is a miscellaneous provisions Bill.  Like Deputy Finian McGrath, who spoke before me, I have a child - a son - in residential care.  I can also say people have suffered over the years of cutbacks.  There are different providers but I can only speak for the provider for my son which is Cheeverstown House.  It has done an enormous amount of cutting back and has created enormous efficiencies.  It is now at a stage where there is very little room for manoeuvre and services are definitely suffering.  Like Deputy Finian McGrath, I hope its hardship can be eased as times get better and that it is prioritised.<\/p><p> The reason I mention it at all is that I fully support the whole notion of contributions.  There was a bit of an outcry when statutory contributions were first introduced.  The contribution made is only a fraction of the cost of the service.  I would be delighted to make the contribution required, as I think most people would be, given the huge contribution taxpayers make towards the services.  This measure in the Bill is a belt and braces provision to ensure persons who are supported or maintained by the HSE or its agents are liable for charges for that support although they are not actually accommodated by the HSE.  The purpose is to give legal backing, even though I presume, in most cases, they are already paying.  <\/p><p> I understand the need to include the whole new range of accommodation types because there has been a proliferation of different types of services in recent years.  As well as the kind of sheltered accommodation provided by local authorities, there are many new living arrangements for people with disabilities.  I am sure the Minister will agree that as the recession bit, the provision of new residential care places virtually came to a standstill and families with people with disabilities had to become ever more involved and had to find more innovative ways to find housing solutions, including buying homes, sharing homes and lending homes.  Sometimes a number of families have come together to provide a home.  They are more than happy to pay for the services with a certain percentage remaining with the clients as pocket money.  Indeed, that arrangement is not dissimilar to the direct provision system for asylum seekers which has received much comment recently, but it is the system which pertains for many people in residential care.  We should welcome the fact the HSE is flexible enough to look at these new models of housing for people with disabilities.  The recession has forced us all to be a bit more imaginative in the way we provide services, whatever they may be.<\/p><p> I agree with previous speakers that it is a little bit worrying to read that the HSE does not know how many people this legislation will apply to or how much it is currently collecting from them.<\/p><p>If the system is to work fairly, it has to be flexible and recognise the different circumstances in which people might get supports from the HSE.  The HSE and local authorities have to be able to respond flexibly.  I recently dealt with a case involving a married couple who rented from their local authority.  The husband had to enter a mental health facility for several months.  He paid the charge in the mental health facility, which meant his wife did not have that income, but she was charged by the local authority based on the benefits accruing to a married couple.  Local authorities and the health service need to co-operate so that people are not disadvantaged.  That is an aside, however, and I welcome the legislation overall.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on it and I look forward to seeing it being implemented at the earliest opportunity so that it can provide the safeguards it envisages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300036#JJ00200","speaker":"1026","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411495500,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the Technical Group for allowing me time to speak on this important Bill.  I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is in the Chamber for this debate.  Given that she is a very practical person, I am sure she wants to hear about practical things that are happening on the ground with regard to our health service.  St. Columbanus Community Hospital in Killarney is an excellent facility with which the Minister of State is familiar and which is run by an excellent management team and by nurses and staff who are stretched to the limit.  Yesterday evening, I received a message from the hospital that a resident, who was not very elderly, wanted to see me.  When I visited the ward on which he was staying, he was not expecting me because he did not have a mobile telephone through which I could contact him to make an appointment.  He was sitting on a chair beside his bed with a towel covering his face.  When I said \"hello\" to him he perked up and pulled the towel off his head.  He explained that he had covered his head with the towel because he has cataracts and has been waiting two years to have them removed.  The Minister of State will be aware this is usually a successful operation and that the distorted vision caused by cataracts can be very upsetting.  This man is only in his early 60s but he is condemned to sit on that chair with a towel over his head because the only way he can get comfort is by seeing blackness in front of his eyes.  If he removes the towel he is upset by the lights and strobes he sees because of the cataracts.<\/p><p>  These operations have been moved to the South Infirmary in Cork, which is inundated to the point where it cannot manage.  Earlier today I listened to the Minister for Finance as he clapped the Government on the back.  I know the Minister of State would not act likewise because she is aware of the issues arising in her Department.  She knows too many stories like that of the nice man I met yesterday to clap herself on the back.  When these issues are addressed, I will be the first person to clap her on the back but I will not do so while we cannot look after people in that position or we condemn those who worked hard and paid their taxes to that type of existence.  I cannot get the experience out of my head because it was an upsetting encounter.<\/p><p>  As a constituency Deputy, I am sure the Minister of State is dealing with similar issues on a daily basis.  We need an honest and open debate about the stress and pressure facing front-line nurses and staff in our community and general hospitals, whether in accident and emergency departments or on the wards, because nurses are at breaking point.  That is not an exaggeration.  Over the summer I had reason to visit Kerry General Hospital and Killarney Community Hospital, as well as other community hospitals, on a daily basis.  I have also been down to Cahirciveen.  Everywhere I go, nurses and other staff tell me they are breaking point.  They are working harder than they ever worked before because they are not given adequate resources to deal with the workload.  It is a dangerous situation saved only by their resilience and the fact they go beyond the call of duty every day.  People who knew I was visiting the aforementioned individual in St. Columbanus home told me that what was happening was a disgrace.  Something has to be done.  I know the Government has to be prudent with money and budgets but there is a difference between being prudent and not providing a service.  When it comes to simple matters, such as waiting lists for cataract or hip operations, it is disgraceful that people continue to suffer.  They do not have sufficient resources by themselves and rely on the health service to ensure they do not have to wait in discomfort, misery or agony.  That is unfortunately the situation.<\/p><p>  The management of our community and general hospitals are excellent.  They provide an excellent service with what they have but they do not have enough.  Kerry General Hospital has not received any structural investment other than the additional work done on the accident and emergency department, which was welcome.  The wards of those hospitals need a huge investment to upgrade them.  I ask the Minister to fight for the necessary resources.  There is Cabinet responsibility for providing proper health care to people who desperately need our help.<\/p><p>  Tomorrow the general practitioners of Ireland will take an unusual action by protesting outside the D&aacute;il.  They do not want to be here because they would prefer to do their work as general practitioners who provide an excellent service.  Unfortunately, when young doctors entering the workforce see the contracts and obstacles this Government is putting in their way, they are bailing out and leaving the country.  Doctors who are growing elderly are saying to themselves they have had enough and are retiring rather than signing up to what is put before them.  We will lose a wealth of experience and will be left with another crisis in terms of a scarcity of good general practitioners willing to work in communities the length and breadth of the country.  It is unprecedented that the doctors are coming here tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300038#LL00200","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411495500,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Defence Forces Mission on the Golan Heights: Statements","time":1411496100,"counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300039#MM00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1411496100,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Since 1974, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, has successfully supervised the implementation of the disarmament agreement maintaining an area of separation between Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.  An infantry group of 130 personnel deployed to the UNDOF mission with the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in September 2013.  It acts as a force reserve company, providing a quick reaction force which is on stand-by to assist with ongoing operations within the mission area.  Ireland has also deployed a counter-improvised explosive device (IED) team.<\/p><p>  The Defence Forces contingent was deployed in response to the then-escalating armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic to protect peacekeepers and military observers in monitoring the area of separation.  The Irish contingent deployed in full armour with extensive weapons, appropriate to the prevailing security position.  Prior to the initial deployment of troops to UNDOF, a full threat assessment and mission reconnaissance was carried out by the Defence Forces.  The chief of staff advised the then Minister that the proposed Defence Forces contingent operating within the numbers and the weapons constraints imposed by the UN had the capability to operate effectively as a force reserve to UNDOF and discharge the mandate.  The further escalation of the conflict in Syria in recent months has affected the UNDOF area of operations very significantly.  Syrian armed forces have deployed and carried out military activities and security operations in the UNDOF area of operations.  Numerous clashes have taken place between Syrian security forces and armed members of the opposition in the area of separation.  More recently, there have been direct attacks on UN personnel deployed in the area and peacekeepers have been detained by armed elements.<\/p><p>  Since 27 August, in response to hostilities, the Irish contingent has dealt with several incidents at the request of the UNDOF force commander.  On 29 August and in a follow-up operation, the force reserve company assisted in the safe extraction of 58 members of the Philippine battalion.  On 30 August, Irish soldiers extracted 35 Filipino troops from a position surrounded by rebels.  In the course of these incidents, Irish troops came under fire and returned fire.  The 45 Fijian peacekeepers detained by armed elements in late August were released unharmed on 11 September.<\/p><p>  Given the evolving security position, the mission has continued to reconfigure its operations with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers while continuing to implement the mission's mandate.  However, in the past fortnight, there has been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission, reflecting the deteriorating position on the ground.  The UNDOF headquarters, including the Irish contingent, has now been relocated to Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  What has happened in the area of separation is entirely unacceptable, and I particularly condemn the unwarranted attacks on and the detention of UN peacekeeping personnel.  This is a monitoring mission designed to report on breaches of an agreement between Israel and Syria, and its structure is designed to this end.  All parties should respect the mission mandate, and there can never be any justification for the attacks on or detention of UN peacekeepers.  Ireland remains committed to the mission but in light of recent events, I have indicated that a fundamental review of the capacity of the mission to fulfil its mandate is necessary.  I personally discussed this review with the Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations a number of weeks ago in Milan.<\/p><p>  The UN Security Council was briefed on the mission in detail 17 September by the UN Secretary General.  On 19 September, the President of the UN Security Council issued a strong statement reaffirming the Council's unconditional support for the UNDOF mission and emphasising the importance of maintaining UNDOF as a vital contributor to peace and security in the broader Middle East.  The Security Council noted in the statement the necessity of efforts to flexibly adjust UNDOF's posture to minimise risk to UN personnel as UNDOF continues to implement its mandate, while emphasising that the ultimate goal is for the peacekeepers to return to their positions in the UNDOF area of operation as soon as is safe and practicable.  The Security Council also noted that it was important to maintain UNDOF's force strength to the level necessary to carry out its important mandate and to retain the quick reaction and counter-IED capabilities provided by Ireland, and which the Council noted as indispensable in the face of the challenging security environment.<\/p><p>  I welcome the strong endorsement of the mission from the Security Council and the call to maintain force strength and key enablers during this period of reconstruction.  In that regard, the UN Secretary General will report again to the UN Security Council around mid October on steps to maintain UNDOF's capacity to discharge its mandate.  I intend to discuss the matter further with UN authorities when I travel to New York later this week for an international summit on peacekeeping.<\/p><p>  As I stated at the outset, UNDOF has played a key role in maintaining peace and security in the area of separation between Israel and Syria since 1974.  It continues to have a role in that regard and Ireland contributes a significant element of the support and protection required by the force.  Further restructuring is required and this is in process, and given current plans and the strong and unconditional endorsement of the mission by the UN Security Council, including the capabilities provided by Ireland, I am satisfied we can continue to contribute to the mission.  On that basis I have advised the Government today that the Defence Forces will continue to participate in the mission and the rotation, as planned, will proceed.  The 44th Infantry Group will be replaced by the 46th Infantry Group, with the new deployment commencing next month.  I expect this to happen in mid October, which is two weeks behind schedule, as that was agreed a number of days ago.  This delay arises because it was deemed that structural changes in the mission should be in place before the arrival of a new deployment, with the people on the mission best placed to bed it down.<\/p><p>  I commend the recent efforts of the 44th Infantry Group in its role as UNDOF's quick reaction force and the personnel in discharging their duties effectively, with courage and professionalism, together with all the peacekeepers participating in UNDOF.  The Government and I place a high importance on the valuable work done by the Defence Forces in the challenging operational conditions faced in the region and in other missions around the world.  I wish the new deployment of 130 troops well in the challenges they will face in the months to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300039#MM00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1411496100,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this matter and I appreciate the Government arranging these statements.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Feargh&aacute;il, did last week, I acknowledge the work done by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on this matter.  Many families are deeply concerned about loved ones who are providing distinguished service on behalf of the country in this particularly difficult theatre of the Golan Heights.  The families of troops who may participate in the next rotation are equally concerned and I take this opportunity to thank the families of all the troops serving overseas.  They make enormous sacrifices so our soldiers can carry out important services on behalf of the country, and their contribution should be recognised today as well.  We share the concern but we also take pride in our servicemen and servicewomen overseas.  Today I particularly remember and salute Army personnel from Westmeath who are part of the 130 troops in the 46th Infantry Group.  As the Minister indicated, it will deployed some time in October to the area in question.<\/p><p>These will replace the 44th infantry group which was deployed last March.  As one of the Deputies representing Athlone, the home of Custume Barracks, I thank the Minister and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Conor O&rsquo;Boyle, for visiting last week to acknowledge and mark the deployment of the 46th infantry.  I thank the Minister for his invitation.  Unfortunately, I could not be present.  It made a change from his predecessor who when he came to Custume Barracks never invited certain Deputies.  I welcome the fact the Minister acknowledged all Deputies from the constituency last week.  His presence and that of the Chief of Staff testified to the high esteem in which the service men and women, and their families, are held by all national and local public representatives and at the highest level of Government.  They are fantastic ambassadors and it was right and proper that the Minister was there to acknowledge them last week. <\/p><p> I join others, inside and outside the House, in applauding the soldiering professionalism of our Defence Forces who are deployed on the Golan Heights.  Our troops are individually and collectively correctly trained and their personal equipment and armaments are of the first order.  The level of protection afforded to them with their electronic counter measure, ECM, enabled MOWAG APCs, armoured reconnaissance vehicles and heavy weaponry is reassuring from a force protection standpoint.<\/p><p> Our soldiers are doing Ireland proud in this most challenging theatre in a fast-changing security environment.  They are a pivotal part of Ireland's foreign policy in pursuit of international peace and security.  I share the concern of others in identifying the outdated nature of the present Security Council Mandate for UNDOF.  It was first agreed in 1974 and its regular extension since then had been adequate until the outbreak of internal hostilities in Syria two years ago.  The present mandate is not workable in the current crisis and does not take cognisance of the new security reality in the UNDOF area of operations, or more correctly stated, the area of separation, AOS, identified in the UNDOF mandate.  The Al Nusra Front rebels are prominent in, and adjacent to, the AOS.  Indeed, the flame of the internal struggle against the Assad Government was first lit in the town of Derra immediately adjacent to the UNDOF AOS.<\/p><p> I urge the Minister to demand that the UN provide immediately all necessary means required by our troops, and all those in UNDOF, to ensure their safety while carrying out the essential elements of the mandate.  I especially call on the Minister to request the UN to deploy immediately sufficient UN helicopters to the AOS to provide the necessary lift and recovery capability consistent with the new operational requirement of the evolving operational tempo.  Of greatest importance is the provision by the UN of the required tactical and operational intelligence essential to the UN forces to operate safely in the AOS.  This is a critical force protection necessity.  Managing risk is essential for our troops.  The certainty of timely and accurate intelligence is the cornerstone of this.<\/p><p> In a recent public statement the Minister suggested that the UN forces of UNDOF withdraw to the Israeli border.  This was an unfortunate lapse in correct terminology in an area where accurate commentary is essential.  The Golan Heights is termed Israeli occupied Syria in international law.  The recognised border of Israel in international law is some distance south of the AOS and withdrawing to the correct Israeli border would ensure that the mandate of UNDOF could not operate.<\/p><p> The planned replacement of the present Irish contingent in UNDOF should proceed, subject to the assets identified by me being put in place.  Soldiering in any scenario is a tough business.  We are duty bound as politicians to ensure the safety and security of our soldiers when so deployed is not compromised.  When the Defence Forces initially deployed to the Golan Heights the current UN Security Council Resolution was the same as the resolution in force at present.  The security situation both in Syria and in the UN AOS on the Golan Heights differed little at that time from the fragile security situation today.<\/p><p> Ireland committed to a Chapter VI mission to a demilitarised zone, which is no longer relevant.  The United Nations must make significant changes to address this issue.  Has the Minister demanded that additional UN helicopters be positioned close to the area of separation to increase the lift and recovery capability of the UN force?  Has consideration been given to strengthening the armed elements of other contingents in the region?  I understand the Irish contingent is providing security for the 1,200 strong force.  Should we not ensure that other contingents are armed to the same degree?<\/p><p> Ireland's mission to the Golan Heights will continue.  I wish all those who have been deployed a safe and successful mission.  They are embarking on another phase of Ireland's long and proud record of service with the UN and they can be sure of our full support in doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300039#MM00300","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411496700,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that time has been set aside to discuss this issue in the D&aacute;il.  We and the rest of the Opposition have called for this.<\/p><p>  All Deputies have been unnerved by recent developments in the Golan Heights.  We all share real concern for the health and safety of Irish troops stationed there on the UNDOF mission.  Irish Defence Forces personnel who have served on UN peacekeeping missions have been a credit to the country through their professional conduct and exceptional work.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to positive Irish neutrality and an independent foreign policy.  We believe Ireland should actively work to promote conflict resolution, peaceful democratic settlements and pathways and mechanisms to facilitate self-determination of peoples throughout the world.<\/p><p>  Our country's background in conflict resolution means Ireland can draw on many lessons which could be applied to other conflict situations.  The State's history of serving in UN blue helmet peacekeeping missions is a matter of pride and enhances our standing as a neutral state.  However, sending troops to the UNDOF mission is not a simple or straightforward decision.  As we know, UNDOF was set up in 1974 to patrol and monitor the strip between Syria and Israel but it has been increasingly caught up in Syria's civil war, with rebel groups attacking UN bases and kidnapping peacekeepers.<\/p><p>  Ireland was asked to provide troops to the mission after Austria announced it was pulling its troops from the mission over security concerns and because the EU failed to renew its arms embargo on Syria.  When we debated this issue on 18 July 2013, my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, made clear that Sinn F&eacute;in felt that the current mandate for UNDOF was not fit for purpose and that EU decisions, coupled with the continued erosion of Irish neutrality by consecutive Governments, robbed Irish troops of their neutrality on this mission.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against sending Irish troops on the UNDOF mission after that debate and we stand over that decision.  Although Sinn F&eacute;in was against this deployment, we recognise that the Government got D&aacute;il approval to deploy these troops, and we have used all opportunities to ensure their safety.  That is of paramount concern to everybody in this House. <\/p><p>  I know that almost all UN troops in the region are now deployed in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights area, including Irish troops, and that the UN Security Council released a statement last Friday strongly backing and unconditionally supporting the UNDOF mission.  The statement also calls on the Secretary General of the UN to provide the Security Council with an update on the &quot;steps necessary to maintain UNDOF's ability to carry out its mandate&quot; within 30 days.  Why did the Minister not wait for the publication of that draft report before making the recommendation to Cabinet which has been endorsed?  Why did he not get more clarity on the changes that will be put in place and the reassurances that we require before making this decision?<\/p><p>We have breaking news reports today that the US, with the support of some Arab countries, has carried out air strikes against ISIS targets in Syria.  This further muddles the complexity of the Syrian war.  Many neighbouring countries are supporting rebel and radical Islamist groups in a variety of direct and indirect ways, while symbolically helping the US to bomb ISIS targets supposedly without the approval of the Syrian Government.  It has been reported that Islamic State fighters will now flee towards Kurdish areas.  Kurdish defence forces have bravely fought off Islamic jihadists since 2012.  Kurdish areas have become a haven for refugees fleeing persecution, but they may now be overrun.  According to reports, over 60,000 Kurds have fled from ISIS in northern Syria - over the Turkish border - in the last few days.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the Government's humanitarian support to the vulnerable and impoverished Syrian population and refugees.  It would support Government initiatives to increase the humanitarian aid and support supplied by the State.  We believe aid should be sent to Kurdish regions in Iraq and Syria.  This should be negotiated directly with Kurdish officials.  All sides in the Syrian conflict need to begin a negotiated cessation of violence and enter into inclusive peace talks immediately.  ISIS is known for its extremist and sectarian beliefs which have been brutally enforced in areas they have conquered, causing massive human rights abuses and executions.  Sinn F&eacute;in condemns this militant group in the strongest possible way.  I will summarise our concerns.  The UN Security Council was divided from the beginning of the Syrian conflict.  Its inaction allowed the conflict to continue without any resolution process being put in place.  This had absolutely devastating consequences.  The international community failed in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300040#NN00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411497300,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The UNDOF mission is not about the Syrian conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300041#OO00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1411497300,"counter":363,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, it has a knock-on effect.  The arms embargo that was removed by the EU before we went out there undermined our neutrality in that equation.  A similar point can be made regarding the emergence of ISIS.  It is clear that interested parties in Europe and the US were supporting rebels in Syria who were heavily financed by the Gulf states, which are allies of Europe and the West, apparently.  Now we have the evolution of ISIS, which has been heavily financed by the Gulf states.  The world needs to confront and defeat this despicable and reprehensible organisation.  This is a scenario of mixed messages.  It is a complex situation.  The Filipino Government recently expressed its concerns about the UN instructions given to soldiers on the ground.  This is a mess.  Our concerns remain.  We await the UN report about how it intends to reorient this mission.  The Minister said last week - I am paraphrasing - that he does not want our Defence Forces to go into harm's way.  We are all realists in this House.  When we send our peacekeepers, of whom we are immensely proud, into peacekeeping operations while wearing the blue helmets of the UN, we know they might be in harm's way.  Every one of them accepts that role fully, bravely and courageously.  Many of them have died in the service of our country while peacekeeping across the world.  We must not unnecessarily - for no good reason - put our troops in harm's way.  That is the concern we continue to have.

I refer to its cynical manipulations in Iraq, and now in Syria.  I could say the same about Russia.  Their manipulations in this area have created an absolute hornet's nest, the worst expression of which is obviously ISIS.  These dangerous people are now overrunning parts of Iraq and Syria.  This mess has resulted directly from the US invasion and occupation of Iraq.  The US sponsored a sectarian government that used sectarian politics - divisions between Shia and Sunni Muslims - to fuel the growth of ISIS.  This needs to be taken alongside the Western support of brutal autocratic regimes like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have been sponsoring certain armed elements to manipulate cynically the crisis in Syria.  I should also refer to the extraordinary double standards when it comes to the treatment of Israel, which has been allowed to get away literally with the murder of Palestinian people in Gaza.  All of the chickens of the West's hypocritical policy in the region are coming home to roost in the most dangerous and terrifying way with the rise of ISIS.

The US is escalating the conflict by starting to bomb.  This will fuel a situation that is already dangerous and disastrous.  The most useful thing we could do in these circumstances is pull our troops out for their own safety and finally begin to stand up to and challenge the inconsistency, hypocrisy, manipulation and double standards of what the big powers are doing in the region, which has fuelled the growth of ISIS and the other insurgent Islamic groups.  We should stop supporting regimes like those in Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  We should stop co-operating with an Egyptian regime that is digging the grave of the Arab Spring in Egypt.  These are the sorts of things we could usefully do instead of endangering the lives of our troops.  If there is no problem, why has the Minister said the mission should be reviewed?  Why has he said we need to rethink its whole purpose?  It is obviously in the context of what is happening in Syria that the Minister is making such remarks.  If this was not an issue, the headquarters of the mission would not have redeployed and the Minister would not have said in his speech that the whole basis of the mission is being reconsidered.  He said that it needs to be reviewed.  That is being done because the Minister can see what a dangerous mess there is.  I am saying we should go one step further by pulling the troops out and finally beginning to challenge the disastrous policies of the Western powers in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300041#OO02200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1411497300,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Government likes the idea of keeping the peacekeeping force in position on the Golan Heights.  I am aware that the troops want to go.  I have serious reservations about the idea of having them there.  I think the Minister knows it is not as safe as it was.<\/p><p>The situation has deteriorated.  It is no longer just a conflict between Syria and Israel.  The original UNDOF troops were put into position to deal with the Israeli Syrian conflict and given the fact that the mission was put in place 40 years ago, it really has not worked.  In fact, for all practical purposes, it has failed because the conflict between Syria and Israel has never been sorted and that was part of the remit of the force initially.<\/p><p> It would also appear that the UNDOF troops on the Golan Heights are currently in the process of being withdrawn west of the Israeli defence lines.  The UNDOF mission established in 1974 was intended as a disengagement force - hence the name.  Its primary purpose was and is to form a buffer zone between Syrian forces in the east and Israeli forces in the west but now the bulk of the UN troops are being withdrawn to the west of the Israeli forces.  Therefore, the UNDOF mission is no longer forming a buffer zone or operating as a disengagement force.  In reality, it is serving no valid purpose.  Recent media reports and statements from the Minister would seem to indicate that Syrian militia forces are in the process of occupying parts of the buffer zone previously occupied by the UN forces.  Since these militias are opposed not only to the Syrian State forces, but also to the Israeli forces, it is possible that there will be some conflict in the region.  The Islamic State is not the only group causing problems in the region.  The so-called moderate forces who are very active in Syria and who are operating very close to this area are being armed by the US at the moment which, to my mind, is absolute madness.  It is one of the craziest international situations we have ever seen.  Russia is pouring arms into the region, as is Saudi Arabia.  Now the US is pouring arms into the region and is bombing parts of Iraq and Syria, contrary to international law.  The situation is getting worse by the day and the people who are suffering the most are the citizens on the ground.  Military intervention in these places does not work.  It is crazy.  It is just throwing oil on the fire to pour more arms into the region.  The US has the strength and the authority to deal with this in a different way but it has not chosen to do so, which is very disappointing.<\/p><p> Given that the Irish troops are now being pulled to the west, it is as if they are forming a buffer for the benefit of the Israelis and I do not see how the Minister can assert that there is a genuine argument for the Irish troops remaining in place.  As I said to the Minister last week during question time, I really believe that there are better things that our soldiers could be doing.  I mentioned the peacekeeping mission in the Congo, where a lot of the troops are not nearly as well trained as the Irish.  Our personnel could do very useful work there.  A lot of the forces in that UN mission are from Third World countries where, unfortunately, the level of training is not as high as in Ireland.  The Irish troops would be of huge benefit there.  I also wonder if Europe is seriously interested in a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine or whether it is happy to go along with NATO's expansionist policy.  Has everyone forgotten that NATO did a deal with Gorbachev when the Soviet Union split up that it would not encroach on the former Soviet Union?  That is exactly what it is doing now and that is where the problems in Ukraine stem from.  That said, we are where we are with Ukraine and we need a peacekeeping force in place there if we want a peaceful solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300041#OO02300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411497900,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I wish to take this opportunity to clarify a few issues because I do not want this debate to broaden out into a general debate on the Middle East and policies in that region.  We have an involvement in two very significant peacekeeping missions in this part of the world.  One is the UNIFIL peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon which Ireland has had major involvement in for many decades.   Pretty close, geographically, to that we have had 130 troops in a peacekeeping mission on the Golan Heights for the past 12 months.  The decision that I have to make, given the changing conditions on the ground, which is always a possibility in any of these volatile areas, is whether we work with the other partners involved in the mission, along with the UN, to restructure the mission and to effectively \"de-risk\" what our soldiers are being exposed to and maintain what has been one of the most successful peacekeeping missions operated by the UN.  Deputy Wallace said that the mission has been a failure but UNDOF has operated since the 1970s observing an armistice between two very powerful nations who were at war until then and it has been hugely successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300042#PP00200","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1411497900,"counter":386,"content":"<p>It did not solve the conflict.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300042#PP00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1411497900,"counter":387,"content":"<p>It was not meant to provide a political solution.  The mandate is a Chapter Six peace observation role where the UN operates within a 75 km long strip, with Mount Hermon at the northern end, down along the Golan Heights.  The UN had a string of posts manned by peacekeepers who were observing the adherence to an armistice and peace plan between two countries and it was hugely successful.<\/p><p>  The situation on the ground, as everybody has acknowledged, has dramatically changed over the past number of months and, in particular, in the past number of weeks and the mission has responded to that by relocating and redeploying troops to safer locations out of what was previously a demilitarised area but which has now become part of the civil war in Syria.  The troops are now located west of an alpha line which the Israelis control where there were a series of UN posts already because the mission was about observing the Israeli side as well as the Syrian side.  Undoubtedly, the ability of the mission to fulfil its mandate, for the moment, is compromised.  Notwithstanding that, the judgment I had to make, having spoken to various ambassadors of countries which are interested and have a stake in ensuring stability in the Middle East, was whether we are better off having a UN presence in that region - in a relatively safe zone, which the troops are in now - in order to try to encourage and deliver stability because the last thing the Middle East needs now is a war between Syria and Israel, or whether we pull out and allow the mission to collapse.  I asked the UN for three things, the first of which was the restructuring of the mission.  I also asked that the UN adopt an open mind towards a re-evaluation of the equipment available to the troops to make sure they can protect themselves and that the UN Security Council would make a very strong and clear statement to that effect.  The UN agreed to all of that and as a result, I believe that Ireland should be committed to this mission because it is much safer now than it has been in recent weeks because of the change and redeployment that has already happened.  The redeployment is not still under discussion but has already happened.  Our troops are well trained and are capable of dealing with potential difficulties but they are now unlikely to encounter such for the foreseeable future because I do not envisage a significant UN presence on the Syrian side of that alpha line any time soon.  The only UN troops on the Syrian side of the alpha line are Nepalese troops on Mount Hermon.  Their posts are at high altitude and will soon be covered in snow.  Furthermore, there is no appetite for a civil war in that part of the Golan Heights.<\/p><p> Commentators are talking about ISIL and Islamic State and US bombing in Syria.  It has been made clear to me that the rebel forces and militia in the Golan Heights are not ISIL or Islamic State, but what is called the al-Nusra Front, which is an offshoot of al-Qaeda.  They have different objectives and we are unlikely to see any bombing happening in that place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300042#PP00400","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411498500,"counter":389,"content":"<p>They are probably good guys.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300043#QQ00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1411498500,"counter":390,"content":"<p>We have seen a structural and dramatic change to the mission, but this remains a peace observation mission.

There are at least 5,000 homeless in this State, with 10,000 seeking the services of Focus Ireland in 2013.  Between 30 and 40 families become homeless every month in Dublin.  On Wednesday night last, 158 persons were found sleeping rough on the streets of the capital.  Shame on us.  Some 74,000 households are on rent supplement and 23,000 on the rental accommodation scheme.  By no stretch of the imagination could these be considered to be adequately housed, with rising rents and repossessions of buy-to-lets.  Today, the leading homeless charity, Simon Community, states that the Government's goal of ending homelessness by 2016 is dead in the water due to its own policies.  It is fantasy.  These are the results of the policies of austerity.  Since 2008, more than &euro;1 billion euro has been cut from the capital budget for housing.  The Minister's predecessors were responsible for some of it and this Government continued the practice.<br\/><br\/>This is what anyone would call an emergency.  The obvious solution to this crisis is to build housing.  That is not to say this will be easy.  It is an expensive solution that will require dedication.  This Government must decide that the social good and the public interest come first.  We must put in place the solutions to this crisis.  The Government must accept that the financial cost in the short term is worth the benefit to society.  A more equal and fair society will reap its own rewards and generate genuine and sustainable prosperity in the future.  For every person and family that short-sightedness fails, we are poorer morally, as a community and as an economy.  It is far more costly to condemn a child to deprivation or a family to homelessness than to give them a home.  This is at the heart of what we propose, that a home is a right we cannot afford to deny to the people.<br\/><br\/>These measures are not an attempt to attack the Government.  Tackling this crisis is far more important than political point scoring, but we are in this position because of failed policies which must be abandoned.  The truth is this Government's policy has put more people into homelessness than it has lifted out.  Through cuts to rent supplement, single parent's allowance, child benefit and young person&rsquo;s dole, through austerity as ruthlessly pursued by this Government, those who struggled previously are now drowning and those who made ends meet are now fighting to keep their heads above water.<br\/><br\/>Despite it seeming late to start to tackle this crisis, it is certainly not too late.  I accept that the Government has in recent times been more willing to accept that the crisis is just that, but a lot more is required than words.  We need real investment and a real commitment.  We need houses and we need them as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>My party's proposals include an additional 6,600 homes for social housing, which the State could build through local authorities.  This could be done by a simple legislative change to release &euro;1 billion from the Strategic Investment Fund for social investment.  Housing people in quality homes seems a good strategy worthy of investment.  The construction of these 6,600 homes would create thousands of jobs.  It would generate increased VAT and income tax revenue.  It would increase local authority rent revenues and stabilise private rents by decreasing demand.  Most important, it would allow 6,600 households to live as people in dignity.  If those 6,600 households were taken out of rent supplement to be housed, it would represent a saving of about &euro;148 million over the next five years.  When one considers all of the extra costs involved in not housing people properly for years on end, this is a conservative figure.  That said, this investment is not the solution but part of a solution.  It is a step in the right direction.  Sinn F&eacute;in is under no illusions about the scale of this crisis or how easy it will be to solve, but we must take the first step and we feel this investment is it.<br\/><br\/>We also propose a suite of measures which seek to help tenants in the private rental market.  Some 20% of accommodation in this State is rental accommodation.  Despite growing numbers, tenant's rights have not received enough focus by Government and regulation is needed.  Rental tenants are routinely misinformed of their rights.  Often tenancy agreements do not respect the rights of tenants, and low standards, high rents and insecure conditions are the norm.  If there is a crisis in social housing, equally there is a crisis in the rental market and it is tenants who are bearing the brunt.  In April, an inspections blitz by Dublin City Council found that 92% of the rental homes it looked at failed minimum standards checks.  These 1,398 flats and apartments were not fit for human habitation, yet they were on the market for prices based not on their quality, but on the desperation of those seeking housing.  They were slums.<br\/><br\/>What we need is an overhaul of standards for private accommodation, of procedures, regulations, oversight and price setting.  That is why we have proposed rent controls as an essential measure to help stop the flow of people into homelessness and to make renting affordable for the low paid and unemployed.  In Dublin, rents have shot up by 26% since 2011.  They have gone up by 10% this year.  Accommodation quality has not improved in tandem.  Daft and other rental sites have 40% fewer properties available due to the repossession of many homes bought on buy-to-let mortgages.  We have called many times for the Minister to carve out a code of conduct with banks in order that tenants are not left in the lurch when a landlord loses control.<\/p><p>The average monthly rent across the State is &euro;915, nearly 50% of an average worker&rsquo;s take-home pay.  The average rent in Dublin city is now &euro;1,233, nearly 60% of the average take-home pay.  Rent controls are not new and have been shown to be effective in conjunction with the State provision of social housing.  Rates should be tied to the consumer price index and the quality of the accommodation.  On <i>Daft.ie<\/i>, there are utterly substandard rooms, studios and flats being let for extortionate prices.  This cannot continue.  Focus Ireland, Threshold, Peter McVerry and even the former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, now the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, agree.  I was very disappointed by the dismissal by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, of the idea of rent control before the PRTB, Private Residential Tenancies Board, even released its report on the matter.<br\/><br\/>Another measure in the motion which my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues will elaborate on is the deposit retention scheme, a Labour policy before it entered government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300043#QQ00700","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411499100,"counter":396,"content":"<p>It will be implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300044#RR00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1411499100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The then responsible Minister, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, even promised to put one in place while rejecting a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the residential tenancies Bill which would have done just that.  Tenants cannot afford to have their deposits withheld without justification which is now such a common practice that nearly every renter has experienced it at least once.  Many renters do not even understand they have a right to their deposit back.  Such a scheme would be a massive improvement.<\/p><p>  We call for a referendum on the right to housing.  The Constitutional Convention overwhelmingly voted to support a referendum on the issue.  It decided the right put before the people should be robust and cognisable by the courts.  This right has been long denied the poorest in our society.  One just needs to look at the recent complaint against the State by the International Federation for Human Rights on behalf of 130,000 residents in estates in inner city Dublin and Limerick.  Housing is not a right in Ireland in 2014.  Instead, it is a very expensive privilege.<\/p><p>  Will the Government take on board these proposals?  I am sure the Minister, like me, has many people coming to his constituency clinics, breaking down over the lack of housing or their rent supplement being stopped.  I have had countless families coming into my office seeking emergency accommodation.  Many of them actually queue up at the hotels offering such accommodation as they are told by the homeless services in their local authority that no places are available.  For those who secure hotel emergency accommodation, they find they have no facilities for their children or for cooking and have to leave their accommodation during the day as they cannot hang around the hotel lobby.  It is an absolute scandal that we are relying on hotels to provide emergency housing.  We must be more imaginative in how we tackle this problem.<\/p><p>  We raised concerns about the housing assistance payment, HAP, during the most recent debate on housing legislation but the then Minister responsible, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, prevaricated.  We identified that anyone who availed of HAP would be taken off the housing waiting list because they would be considered to be adequately housed.  The Minister of State responded to our concerns by saying they would be put on the transfer list.  The reality is that anyone on the transfer list will not be considered eligible for social housing for two years.  Some local authorities do not even have a transfer list.  The Minister was misinformed in this regard.<\/p><p>  Schemes which allowed people to make a financial contribution towards senior citizen local authority accommodation seem to have fallen off the radar with many local authorities suspending them.  Now, there are waiting lists in most local authority areas with people who want to go into senior citizen accommodation.  As much of this accommodation consists of bedsits, financial contributions made by applicants could help in converting them into double accommodation, as is happening in some of the schemes in my area.  There are options to get extra housing that we need to look at more carefully.<\/p><p>  I know the Government made much play about dealing with social housing voids.  The voids were a natural progression in our system.  If a person died or for whatever reason left their local authority house, the next person in line got it.  Unfortunately, the number of empty local authority houses in such cases built up over the years because of a lack of funding to renovate the void after it was vacated.  We need to get back to the roll-on effect with people getting housing in such circumstances and not building up voids.<\/p><p>  Landlords the length and breadth of the country are putting up the prices of their rental properties.  In many cases people are ending up homeless or looking for another rental supplement to match these increases.  This is impossible in the Dublin area.  That is why we have called for rent controls but the Government has refused to introduce them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300044#RR00300","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1411499100,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I understand Deputies Michael Colreavy and Jonathan O'Brien wish to share time.

First, we should not talk about houses but homes, although I am certain I will lapse in that regard myself.  There is a difference between a house and a home.  A house can be used by someone to make a profit on or visit occasionally, such as one at a nice seaside place.  A home, however, is where families are reared, shelter is provided and people feel safe and secure.  It is their little place in this world.<\/p><p>  There appears to be a paradox in this regard in Ireland, however.  For the past several years, we have been in the throes of a financial crisis as a result of an economic system where the building of houses, apartments, office and industrial buildings played a major role.  However, despite the massive number of units built during the so-called &ldquo;tiger period&rdquo;, a wholly insufficient number of local authority homes were constructed.  Private developers were given the ability to opt out of their social responsibility under Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  At the same time, local authorities were also selling off many properties but were slow to replenish stock.  While the Government is not responsible for much of what happened then, perhaps the parties opposite should have done more when in opposition to make sure that it did not happen.<\/p><p> The Government is responsible for fixing the problem.  That is its job.  As an Opposition we are responsible for giving the Government proposals and suggestions to help it to fix the problem that was left by the previous Government.  That is the way I see it.  We are not here to score political points, we are here to help.<\/p><p> The public private partnership model which prioritised profit over the provision of homes was one which was pursued during the Governments of the Celtic tiger era.  Major housing regeneration in Dublin such as St. Michael's estate, in Dominic Street and O'Devany Gardens collapsed when developers decided the profit margin would not be great enough for them or because they got into financial trouble.  Let us contrast that with the situation that has developed since the onset of the recession where more than &euro;1 billion has been cut from the housing budget to construct homes for those who need them.  That, coupled with cuts to rent supplement and the failure to tackle the crisis in employment has resulted in a spiralling of the number of people who now need homes.  The situation is almost past the stage of being able to claw it back.<\/p><p> Even at this late stage Sinn F&eacute;in has an alternative vision of how housing needs should be addressed.  We believe the right to a home is a basic human right, one which must be protected by the State.  Such a right cannot be granted or withdrawn at the whim of a Government or a Minister.  We recommend that this right be enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and enforceable by the courts, as was recommended by the recent Constitutional Convention.  That change, and the funding to support it, should it be introduced, would transform the situation in terms of homes and homelessness in Ireland.  Adequate housing should be defined as a home with suitable privacy, space, security, accessibility, lighting, ventilation, basic infrastructure, and location with regard to work and basic facilities.  Sinn F&eacute;in maintains that everyone has the right to protection from homelessness.  We also believe that every person has the right to security of tenure, whether in public or private housing.<\/p><p> However, the reality of the current situation is very stark and it is depressing to read the figures and to translate them into the human misery they represent.  Currently, approximately 90,000 households need homes.  That is more than 100,000 men, women and children.  Many are living with relatives or friends in grossly overcrowded conditions; other are living in substandard and overpriced rented accommodation while others still are in emergency accommodation for the homeless provided by local authorities or charities or are among the growing numbers sleeping rough on our streets.<\/p><p> Rent supplement costs the State a large sum but it does not solve the crisis that exists in this country.  A total of 74,000 households are in receipt of rent supplement at a cost of &euro;344 million a year to the State.  The cap that was introduced by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is well below the market average.  That is the context of rising rents, especially but not solely in Dublin.  In my area the maximum rent supplement that is paid is totally unrealistic and the situation will not change until rent control is introduced to reduce the level of rent currently paid in the private sector.  The failure of rent supplement to tackle the housing crisis has forced people into homelessness because they are unable to match the market rate of rents.<\/p><p> The housing assistance payment, which is to replace the rent supplement, will remove recipients from waiting lists and condemn them to stay in private accommodation at the whim of the market for as long as they remain renters.  That is the most unkind cut of all.  The State has abdicated responsibility for such people who must continue to rent privately.  That is shameful.  It is a Government attempt to make it seem that the housing waiting list is reducing when in fact the Government is removing itself ever further from tackling the crisis in terms of the provision of homes for those who need them.<\/p><p> During the tenure of the Government there has been a failure to deliver homes that were originally promised by NAMA for social housing.  It is scandalous to see so many empty housing units in this country and at the same time to see people lie in the street.  It is scandalous that people cannot get a roof over their heads while there are empty houses all over the country.  That makes no sense.  To date, only 531 of a current total of 5,294 homes that were promised have been completed.  As of June 2014, a total of 15 local authorities delivered no NAMA housing whatsoever.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in has identified &euro;1 billion in unused money from Ireland's strategic investment fund.  If we were to use the money, an additional 6,600 homes could be built over and above current targets, and 10,000 new social housing units could be built before next summer.  The projection is based on costings from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in addition to figures from the Department on long-term vacant social housing units.  In 2012, Sinn F&eacute;in proposed a large-scale investment through which it was projected that as many as 9,000 homes could be built for the same money.  Failure by Government to act on the proposals at the time has resulted in the estimates being revised downwards.  There are also additional benefits to constructing an extra 6,600 homes.  I refer to the significant number of jobs for construction workers, many of whom have struggled to find sustainable employment since the bubble burst and who are unemployed.  So many new homes would generate considerable rent for local authorities and could save the State &euro;29 million if 6,600 households on rent supplement were placed in permanent homes.<\/p><p> The rising cost of rent is also pushing many who are on the brink into homelessness.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a fair rent control system which bases rates on the consumer price index and the quality of accommodation.<\/p><p>Rent controls exist in some form in many European states, including Britain, France and Germany.  Focus Ireland, Fr. Peter McVerry, Threshold and even prominent members of the Labour Party have supported call for some form of rent control.  I understand a report on this is due to be published by Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, this month.  Unreasonable rent increases cause many to lose a permanent roof over their heads and introducing measures to tackle this problem could, in some way, help our housing crisis.<\/p><p> In the north west it appears that local authorities have no funding to renovate vacated houses for re-letting or to facilitate transfers, even in the most meritorious of cases.  Why is this?  If we are serious about our responsibility to provide homes for those who cannot afford them, this situation cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p><p> I propose we accept the fact that in this State marriage and partnership breakdowns occur in some families.  The State has not tackled this and it must be addressed because couples who divorce and separate are put through great difficulties when dealing with local authorities on housing.  I am not saying it is easy - I am saying it needs to be addressed.<\/p><p> I will conclude by referring to a family from Slovakia that I dealt with yesterday.  They may as well be Irish.  I would not like to see an Irish family in Slovakia treated as this family has been treated here.  The family has been here for most of the past seven years and four children were born in Ireland.  One of the boys spent four years in Irish secondary school.  The family was not familiar with Ireland's system of social protection and the father of the family worked in various odd-jobs for farmers and builders.  When the jobs dried up in Ireland, the family moved to England for a short period for work.  They did not find work in England and so returned to Ireland.  Due to the habitual residence requirement, the father does not qualify for jobseeker's allowance nor supplementary welfare and the family cannot get on the housing list of the local authority.  The father cannot pay the private rent and he is to be evicted tomorrow.  When I contacted some agencies for the homeless, I learned there was no place available for this man and his family tomorrow.  If children are starving and homeless, what am I doing here?  What are any of us doing here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300044#RR00500","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411500300,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey, on their appointments and wish them the best in their new roles.  They face difficult jobs.  The housing issues we are discussing were not created by them but they have an opportunity to do something positive and rectify the problems facing many people throughout the country.  I left the Chamber to get a copy of the proposed amendment because I did not have a chance to read it before I arrived.  It outlines some of the actions taken by the Government since it took power and some are welcome - I will not suggest the Government has done nothing positive.  The former Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, worked on the issue of vacant dwellings in local authority areas and earmarked funding for this.  This is starting to pay dividends in my area of Cork city - vacant houses have become available and this is welcome.<\/p><p>  The former Minister of State also introduced the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014, which brought in the housing assistance payment, HAP, but I have a problem with this system.  In theory, allowing a person continued access to housing supports when re-entering employment is very welcome.  I raised my issue with the HAP system at the time it was debated and so did Deputy Ellis.  My problem, specifically, is when a person becomes a HAP recipient, he or she is taken off the social housing list.  I have read the Government position on this and I have examined the statements of the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  They are reflected in the amendment that is to be moved by the Minister, which states that a HAP recipient will be able to access other housing options, such as local authority housing and voluntary housing schemes.  However, many local authorities do not operate a transfer list.  If the Minister is serious in what he says, he must direct such local authorities to operate a transfer list scheme.  He must also outline the basic criteria for operating such a scheme or there will be a haphazard approach throughout the State.  Uniformity is required when it comes to transfer onto the HAP system.<\/p><p>  Regarding the construction of social housing, Sinn F&eacute;in has identified &euro;1 billion that could create 6,600 dwellings at an average price of around &euro;150,000 - this would save around &euro;29 million in increased rents.  The amendment to be tabled by the Minister states that 2014 will see the completion of around 11,000 houses and points out that a further 6,000 are earmarked.  If this is the case, then I welcome it.  However, this brings me to the main issue.  It is not just a question of building houses - it will take more than 6,600 newly constructed houses to rectify the problem.  This is a multifaceted issue that requires a multifaceted solution of which the construction of social housing is only one aspect.<\/p><p>  Newly constructed social housing cannot consist only of standard two and three bedroom houses.  I served as a councillor on Cork City Council for 11 years and over 50% of the people on the waiting list there are single applicants.  We could build 6,600 or 11,000 two and three bedroom houses this year but it will not cater for single applicants.  If we are serious about reducing housing waiting lists through a scheme of social housing construction, there must be a mix that caters for everyone in every circumstance.  In addition to this, some areas have an ageing population and in my constituency I know of very elderly people in three and four bedroom council homes who want to downsize.  This may be due to disability or difficulty getting upstairs and to the bathroom.  Such people tell the council that they no longer require such a large home and would prefer something smaller that will be less onerous - perhaps a bungalow with a walk-in shower.  They ask that the house be given to a family that needs it.  Unfortunately, Cork City Council does not have that housing stock.  Elderly people are forced to remain in three or four bedroom houses where it is impossible for them to get upstairs or access bathrooms.  In such circumstances, housing officials recommend the person apply for an adoption grant to convert a bath into a walk-in shower.<\/p><p>They might get a stairlift.  Then they apply for the housing adaptation grant, only to find there is no funding for it.  They are stuck in this situation and meanwhile a family living in very overcrowded conditions and crying out for housing cannot get this house because we do not have the proper mix of house build.  The Minister will publish a report on social housing in the coming weeks and I hope any report coming from the Department will take these issues on board.  These are the nitty-gritty issues which would go a very long way to giving some relief to many individuals on the housing list.<\/p><p> I also wish to discuss rent allowance, the private sector and individuals on rent allowance schemes, RAS.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that in the 1980s we had a rent cap in place, or at least there used to be rent controls.  As far as I am aware they were ruled unconstitutional as the result of a court case.  Earlier this year the then Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, stated she was examining the possibility of some form of rent stability measure.  Whether she wanted to call it rent control was down to herself.  In some of his recent remarks the Minister has ruled out this option, but he does not state this in the amendment to the motion, which states all options will be examined.  If this is one of the options which comes forward as part of the report due next week the Minister will examine it, and if it means changing legislation this will be seriously considered.  I welcome this.  A total of 80% of people who come to my constituency office do so with housing-related issues such as those with a mortgage crisis; those on the verge being kicked out of a private tenancy because the rent has increased and they can no longer afford to give a backhander to the landlord because the rent supplement is nowhere near adequate; or the standard of accommodation not being up to scratch.<\/p><p> Earlier today I downloaded from the Department's website the most recent document, which dates from 2011.  The document had multifaceted solutions and one of these was RAS.  I do not know if the review will take RAS into account but I can tell the Minister hand on heart it is a disaster.  People come to my office who went on RAS believing they would remain on local authority waiting lists only to find out later this was not the case.  A property may have been up to scratch when it was first inspected but now it is in RAS the owner may have decided he or she is getting the money and will not make refurbishments or maintain the house.  At present some RAS properties are a disgrace.  RAS needs to be examined because it is a disaster waiting to happen.  People are coming to our offices and going to local authorities stating they want to get out of RAS properties and back into local authority properties if possible.  It is just not working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300046#TT00200","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411500900,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, will share time with Deputy Michelle Mulherin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300047#UU00200","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1411500900,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

develop and publish in the coming weeks a Social Housing Strategy which will set out a series of actions to address the supply of social housing over the next five years; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; identify and facilitate the most appropriate models to maximise supply, management and maintenance of social housing in the longer term in order to deliver the key social housing objective of providing both for those households who cannot afford to house themselves and those who struggle to afford housing in the private market.&quot;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>I thank the Deputies for proposing the motion.  I kick off by saying I welcome the contributions of the Deputies but I find it quite amazing and unbelievable, and I am sure the Deputies across the House will share this with me, that the supposedly main Opposition party does not have one representative during this debate on such an important topic for everyone.  The spokesperson might be busy, but it is absolutely unbelievable that not one representative of Fianna F&aacute;il could be here this evening.  I have no doubt its leader and spokesperson will be waxing lyrical about housing, social housing and homelessness in the coming weeks, but I will not be short on pointing out that it could not find somebody to be here this evening to discuss a very important topic.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the fact that Members have raised the important issues of housing and homelessness, thus affording me the opportunity to demonstrate the Government's strongest commitment to tackling these issues through a very wide range of actions, many already under way and others planned.  I fully acknowledge the seriousness of the situation and it requires a comprehensive response with specific and ongoing actions, as will be outlined.<br\/><br\/>Key to an improvement in the housing situation is of course the broader economic recovery.  The Government's economic policies are working and as we move on from the legacy of dealing with the collapse of the economy, and in particular the construction industry, very positive trends continue to emerge.  The standardised unemployment rate in August 2014 was 11.2%, the lowest it has been since 2009.  Also, preliminary estimates for the second quarter of 2014 indicate that GDP increased by 1.5% in volume terms on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the first quarter of 2014 while GNP increased by 0.6% over the same period.<br\/><br\/>These are all positive signs that we are in the midst of an economic recovery, from which people and communities are at last beginning to see real benefits.  Increasing house prices in certain locations is a double-edged sword.  It is a symptom of an improving economy and growth in employment, and it allows some homeowners to move out of negative equity, which I am sure we all wish.  However, it makes access to the housing market more difficult, puts pressure on the cost of living and potentially make us more uncompetitive.  It also contributes to rent increases and can also increase the risk of homelessness.  It requires short and long-term action and this is what the Government will deliver on, with social housing being at the core of this strategy.<br\/><br\/>In essence, we are dealing with the legacy of a failed policy of relying on the private sector to deliver our social housing needs.  I agree with the Deputies opposite on this point.  The developer-led policies of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il regime will become a thing of the past and housing developments of the future will be focussed on people and communities, as opposed to greed.  Our plans are about enriching communities as opposed to developers.  There are acute pressure points in the housing sector, such as homelessness, which are a direct result of the failed economic policies in the past. There are legacy issues which need to be dealt with.  There is no magic wand that wipes them away, but I am fully intent on not repeating the same mistakes of the past and will introduce progressive policies and change.<br\/><br\/>In a similar vein, I point out that fantasy economics and false promises made outside the Chamber will not deal with the housing crisis in the way Sinn F&eacute;in has stated.  I am not so sure how many times the strategic investment fund has been mentioned or referenced by Sinn F&eacute;in, but it is unsustainable, insincere and not achievable because it has been spent multiple times and again here by Deputy Ellis.  I caution against overtly politicising matters such as homelessness, as the problems being experienced in Dublin, which need to be dealt with, are the same as those being experienced in Belfast where Sinn F&eacute;in has Executive power.  The Northern Ireland homelessness problem has been identified as being one of the worst in the UK.  Condemning the problem in Dublin will merely serve to prove that Sinn F&eacute;in is bereft of a political soul, prepared to promise money it does not have and we do not have to secure votes.  In fairness, this is not the way to do business.<br\/><br\/>Increasing public and private housing supply is a recognised priority and the Government's Construction 2020 strategy, published on 14 May 2014, a blueprint for a properly functioning and sustainable construction sector.  I and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, are absolutely determined to deliver it.  Through its 75 actions, it provides for a strategic approach to returning the construction sector, in a sustainable fashion, towards the provision of housing based on real and measured demand and addresses the full range of relevant issues, including the planning process, access to mortgage finance and the construction workforce.<br\/><br\/>Funding for housing in 2014 by the Department is more than &euro;647 million, which exceeds 2013 levels.  This represents almost 70% of the Department's total budget.<\/p><p>Earlier this year my Department announced a return to mainstream local authority housing construction and in particular the announcement of a &euro;68 million construction programme over 2014 and 2015 that will enable local authorities to construct more than 450 houses.  In May details of capital investment totalling more than &euro;46 million for a range of housing projects, which will provide 416 units of accommodation for people with special needs, were announced.  Of the &euro;46 million, some &euro;19 million has been ring-fenced for the delivery of 187 units to be acquired or constructed in local authority areas across the country specifically to accommodate persons and families who are homeless.<\/p><p> Some &euro;10 million is being provided for the acquisition of 66 units by approved housing bodies to address the homeless problem specifically presented in the Dublin city area.  The balance of the &euro;46 million, approximately &euro;16.7 million will fund the delivery of 163 units to accommodate persons with a disability and older persons in various locations around the country.<\/p><p> Some &euro;30 million will fund the special measure to bring more than 1,900 vacant and boarded-up units back into social use.  I deal with local authorities all the time and I have made it an absolute priority for local authorities to get these units back into place as quickly as possible.  These units should never have been left go for the years they have been boarded up.  It is scandalous and the local authorities, particularly in this city, need to get these units open and accessible to people straight away.  It is crazy that this has gone on year on year over the past decade or so.  I find it criminal to see these units boarded up when I have driven around the city of Dublin over the past ten years or so.<\/p><p> A further &euro;10 million will resolve many of the most difficult unfinished housing estates and result in enhanced quality of life for families.  Earlier this year, some &euro;38.4 million was allocated to local authorities for the suite of housing adaption grants for older people and people with a disability.  These grants will enable people to continue to live independently and remain at home for longer.  In the case of local authority-owned properties, funding is allocated each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock.  I recently announced the allocation of &euro;23 million in capital funding for this purpose.  Of this allocation, some &euro;8 million will be provided to local authorities for adaptations and extensions to social housing to meet the needs of tenants with a disability or to areas serious overcrowding.  Some &euro;15 million will be invested in upgrading the energy efficiency of local authority homes this year.  This is part of a three-year jobs stimulus programme that will see the energy efficiency of more than 25,000 of the most poorly insulated local authority homes improved.  I am sure everybody in the House welcomes that.<\/p><p> This year, under the national regeneration programme, some &euro;70 million is being provided to support regeneration programmes in Ballymun, Dublin city, Limerick, Cork, Tralee, Sligo and Dundalk.  This ambitious programme of regeneration projects addresses the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.  In all, more than 6,000 social housing units will be provided for in 2014 through leasing and existing capital programmes.<\/p><p> This will include 275 new units for people with special housing needs; a further 150 new units to be provided specifically for people with disabilities leaving institutional care through leasing arrangements, etc.; an additional 200 new homes under social housing investment programmes; an additional 1,900 new units from the construction stimulus package for void properties; more than 350 new transfers under the mortgage-to-rent scheme; approximately 850 new units through leasing arrangements; and a further 2,500 new transfers under the RA scheme. Those are just this year's actions.  The housing matter is about much more than money however, it is about output and putting roofs over people's heads.  The main engine behind actions on this will be the Government's soon to be published social housing strategy that is being formulated and nearly concluded.<\/p><p> The Government is committed to addressing the range of challenges it faces in the area of social housing.  I am absolutely determined to do that.  Construction 2020 provides for the development of a social housing strategy.  The strategy will propose a range of approaches and many reforms that are innovative and challenging, and will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland.  It is being developed by my Department with input from key personnel in the Housing Agency and the National Economic and Social Council, following a public consultation process, which has significantly informed the drafting process.  My intention is that the strategy will contain clear measurable actions that are to be taken to increase the supply of social housing.<\/p><p> It is clear that present and future solutions must be found to harness new funding streams.  That is critical.  It is not easy but it has to be done.  While the local authorities will continue to have the lead role in addressing social housing need in their capacity as statutory housing authorities, the growing role of the not-for-profit sector, as represented by the approved housing bodies and other potential investors will also be further developed.  Through this strategy, the Government intends developing a new vision of public housing provision that provides both for those households that cannot afford to house themselves and those who struggle to afford housing in the private market.  I believe that working together we can ensure that people have the homes they and their families need, now and for the generations to come.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Brien made a very important point.  The housing requirements of the past as regard the demographic profiles, and the housing requirements of now and the future are very different.  There is no longer the same requirement for three-bedroom houses given the percentage of people who are single and need housing, and also single with one, two or three children.  It is a completely different profile that we always need to monitor.<\/p><p> The strategy will set out a series of actions to compensate for the short to medium-term shortage of supply and I look forward to working with my colleagues in government in achieving the significant Exchequer investment needed.  Given supply issues in some areas, reliance on the private rental sector to meet housing need is not sustainable and the Government accepts that the delivery of significant new build is required.<\/p><p> Increasing the public housing stock will have the additional benefit of alleviating pressure on the private market in terms of rents and purchase prices.  The strategy will be finalised over the coming weeks with further consultation as required, taking cognisance in particular of the Estimates process.  It is proposed that following approval by Government, the final strategy, including a complete action plan and governance arrangements, will be published thereafter.<\/p><p> I now wish to address the criticisms of the rental accommodation scheme made earlier.  The RA scheme, RAS, remains one of the principal mechanisms available to local authorities to provide suitable quality accommodation for those in need of housing.  Up to the end of June 2014, close to 49,800 households had been transferred by local authorities from rent supplement and housed directly under RAS and other social housing options.  RAS has been, and continues to be, a successful programme which has delivered quality housing to a large number of households.  However, there are issues.<\/p><p> If the dwelling that the household is living in becomes unavailable through no fault of their own, local authorities, with the co-operation of the tenants, do and will make every effort to source alternative accommodation as quickly as possible.  In seeking replacement accommodation a local authority will attempt to source a suitable alternative within or close to the area in which the tenant is residing.  However, as we all know, that may not always be possible.  Therefore, in all cases, not just where a tenancy is under threat, there is no bar on RAS households from sourcing alternative accommodation themselves, if they so desire.<\/p><p> Mortgage to rent targets the most acute arrears cases where a situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  There are chronic arrears cases that have been agreed by both the lender and borrower to be unsustainable.  Many of these households are desperately seeking solutions, and seeking certainty for themselves.  I presume every Member in this House has met such people.  In that context under the mortgage-to-rent scheme families remain in their home and pay a rent which is based on their household income.  A household with mortgage arrears goes from being a homeowner to becoming a social housing tenant.<\/p><p> To be eligible for the mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must also be eligible for social housing support.  Taking on board recent criticism of the length of time it takes for mortgage-to-rent transactions to be completed, my Department directed the Housing Agency to undertake a review of operation of the scheme to devise a more streamlined approach that could be expected to accelerate the movement of cases through the system, which is an absolute priority.<\/p><p>I am confident the changes made on foot of that review will speed up the process and ensure that those availing of this option can have their situation resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner.  In a similar vein, I intend to meet senior officials in the banking sector to remove blockages to people accessing the scheme and I will work with some of the debtor-advocate groups that are campaigning for people in severe debt distress.  I expect change as a result of all this work, particularly with the aforementioned advocate groups, working with the banking institutions and with the Housing Agency.  The Department also introduced in February 2014 on a national basis a mortgage-to-rent scheme for local authority households similar to that in place for private mortgages.<\/p><p> My Department continues to work closely and successfully with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies in the delivery of social housing.  NAMA has worked well with my Department and other key stakeholders as partners in the delivery of social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300047#UU00300","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411502100,"counter":408,"content":"<p>No, it has not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300049#WW00200","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1411502100,"counter":409,"content":"<p>More than 700 social housing units have been delivered to date thanks to this collaboration, and in excess of 1,000 units will have been delivered by the end of this year.  I also wish to state that NAMA has made available virtually all of its housing stock to local authorities for social housing.  However, not all of it was deemed suitable.  Nevertheless, I state confidently that NAMA will become a key engine in social housing delivery as it moves further into the space of construction and development.  There will be a substantial social benefit from its housing activities.<br\/><br\/>The issue of the quality of construction standards is also often raised.  Gradually, the Government is coming to grips with dealing with the absolutely dreadful legacies of unfinished estates and poorly built, substandard homes and buildings, with examples being the progress being made under the Priory Hall resolution framework and by the Pyrite Resolution Board, not to mention the resolution of a significant number of unfinished estates, in which very significant progress has been made.  In a social housing context, standards are ensured through the application of the building regulations setting out the minimum legally-acceptable standards and the quality housing for sustainable communities policy guidance for local authorities, which ensures that individual homes are designed to be part of a well-planned and well-integrated social environment and thereby become a good place to live.  I commit here to overseeing a new era of quality in the construction industry, in which standards are maintained and enforced nationwide and I will be working with the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, in particular on this issue.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to the private rented sector, which is an important element of the housing market with the proportion of households in this sector almost doubling in the period between 2006 and 2011.  I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin, its surrounding conurbation and other urban centres.  I absolutely appreciate that people are under immense pressure in this regard.  As with many of the problems being experienced in relation to housing, the fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply.  Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue for the Government and will be targeted under the Construction 2020 strategy in tandem with its proposed social housing strategy.  In addition, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, was asked recently to conduct a study to explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents.  It is due to report back to me shortly with policy recommendations.  I understand my officials have already received details of the report.  It is the first of two studies on the future of the private rented sector and focuses on options to address the recent escalation in rents, particularly in the Dublin area and surrounding conurbation.  I understand it explores a range of issues in regard to rent stability ranging from an examination of rent regulation regimes to the tax treatment of the private rented sector and the role of rent supplement.  I welcome it and look forward to reading it.  It will require careful consideration, together with colleagues in government, before deciding on the best options to address the current difficulties in the market.  However, it will be taken seriously.<br\/><br\/>I remind Members that the Government's overriding objective is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants and society as a whole.  While not wishing to understate the extent of the problems being experienced by certain segments of the private rented sector, on average, rents in Dublin are still 12.7% lower than they were at their peak in the fourth quarter of 2007, while rents nationally are almost 19% lower than their peak in 2007.  I acknowledge this does not take away from the substantial problem that must be addressed.  Nevertheless, there is no question but that low-income tenants are experiencing difficulties in sourcing affordable rental accommodation and I am committed to looking at all possible solutions that can assist the most vulnerable.  However, when considering this report and any proposed measures to assist low-income tenants in meeting their housing costs, including any system of rent regulation, it is crucial that these measures are carefully thought out and targeted to meet the needs of low-income tenants.  While I have not seen the report as yet, I am in favour of promoting more long-term tenancy agreements as a way of introducing stability to the market.  This type of certainty would be beneficial for both landlords and tenants, which coupled with a deposit protection scheme that I absolutely guarantee will be advanced shortly, will help bring some stability to those reliant on the private rental market.  It has been suggested that linking rents to the consumer price index may be the solution to the current problem.  However, in looking back at rents over the past decade, had such a system been in place, rents would have been higher in every year than were the prevailing market rents.  Rent controls such as those suggested by some Members may hold out the promise of affordable and stable rents but it is essential that the Government explores all the options available to it to address the current difficulties and to ensure its policy decisions are informed decisively.  The Government must also ensure that anything it does is constitutionally certain.<br\/><br\/>There rightly has been a major public focus on issues of homelessness in recent times.  Indeed, there is significant pressure on homelessness services at present.  Recent figures show there are 127 people sleeping rough in the Dublin region, while there are approximately 150 families residing in hotel accommodation in Dublin.  In February 2013, the Government's homelessness policy statement was published, in which the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach that is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  As this is a matter of the highest priority for the Government, the decision was taken to ring-fence funding for homeless services by the Government in budgets 2013 and 2014 in support of the discharge by local authorities of their statutory role in the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  In the past two years in Dublin, approximately 1,500<b><\/b>people have moved from homeless services to independent living, with necessary supports.  This is to be welcomed but must be built upon.  The implementation plan for the State's response to homelessness was published in May 2014 and is a practically-focused delivery plan that contains 80 actions which are direct, immediate and solutions-based and which contribute to the delivery of a ring-fenced supply of 2,700 units of accommodation by the end of 2016.  This plan was developed by a team of senior officials from my Department, the Department of Social Protection, housing authorities and the Health Service Executive.  The implementation of this plan requires and will get a whole-of-Government approach to addressing homelessness.  Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet committee on social policy and a copy of the second quarter progress report is available on my Department's website.<br\/><br\/>On the question of introducing a constitutional right to housing, the Housing Acts govern social housing in Ireland.  The range and extent of measures implemented under the Housing Acts demonstrates the State's long-standing commitment to ensuring that housing needs, especially social housing needs are adequately addressed.  The inclusion of a legal right to housing in the Constitution has not been pursued to date on the basis that decisions regarding the allocation of financial resources is a matter for the Government and not the Judiciary.  The Government considers that the most appropriate way of addressing the rights issue in respect of housing is to continue the various programmes and fiscal incentives currently in place, to secure the necessary level of funding to support them, to review their operation on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are meeting their objectives and to put in place new programmes or measures as required.<br\/><br\/>As the Government's housing policy statement of 2011 puts it quite succinctly, the Government's vision for the future of the housing sector in Ireland is based on:<blockquote>choice, fairness, equity across tenures and on delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.  The overall strategic objective will be to enable all households access good quality housing appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.<\/blockquote>I do not think anyone in this House would disagree with these principles, which I intend to turn into reality.<\/p><p> I have endeavoured, through my amendment to the motion, to reassure Deputies of the absolute priority this Government attaches to the issues of housing provision and homelessness and remind them of the range of actions we are taking, and will take into the future, to assist the most vulnerable members of our society.  I assure colleagues of my fixed intention, together with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, to address these issues in a timely fashion.  We have a plan set out for the coming years to address what is a priority issue for everybody in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300049#WW00300","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411502700,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I begin by acknowledging the seriousness with which the Minister and the Government are dealing with this issue and the multifaceted approach that is being taken.  The Minister has set out the range of measures to be taken, some of which have already been implemented.  However, problems remain.  In the time available to me, I will focus on a particular aspect of housing, namely, the role played by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, in the sector.<\/p><p>  NAMA is one of the largest property companies in the world and has a major bearing on the recovery of the property market and construction sector in this country via the manner in which it does its business.  The Minister indicated that housing units have been identified by the agency and are in the process of being transferred to local authorities to form part of their social housing stock.  I welcome that as part of alleviating the shortage of housing.  However, as NAMA embarks upon its major plan to construct residential and commercial units, we must have clarification as to what empirical evaluation of market demand has been conducted.  It is not so long ago that all the talk was of an oversupply of houses, with suggestions that properties at various locations would have to be torn down.  That seems incredible now.  We must be sure we are building the right properties in the right areas at the right time.<\/p><p>  Earlier today, representatives of the not-for-profit think thank, Property Industry Ireland, appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht to discuss issues pertaining to supply and demand in both the residential and commercial property markets.  While the witnesses welcomed the Government strategy set out in Construction 2020, they pointed out that there is often a gap in the property market data available to Government and other stakeholders which can result in issues in the market being pursued in a vacuum.  For example, the Central Statistics Office will publish house price data tomorrow which will refer only to properties purchased using a mortgage.  Information on cash transactions, which now account for 50% of all house purchases, will not be included.  We have had no further data from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government since it released information last February on the number of commencement notices for new developments received by local authorities.  These examples illustrate the gaps in information, which is something the Minister might address in due course.<\/p><p>  We need to know what strategies NAMA intends to pursue to ensure a steady stream of supply of new housing units to the market on a yearly basis, which shovel-ready landbanks for development belonging to developers it has under its control, and to what extent such developers are either being assisted or impeded in developing those sites.  Has NAMA been restricting supply and, if so, how has this contributed to the property bubble now arising in Dublin and other parts of the country?  Of course, if right were right and we were heading back to what could be classed as normal in the construction industry, the business of developing and finance would be a matter between banks and builders.  The banks, however, have no money to lend to builders and, instead of that issue being sorted out, NAMA is embarking upon development with no track record in this regard.<\/p><p>  Of particular concern in all of this is NAMA's treatment of developers, the very people who have the expertise and experience to deliver the massive housing projects we desperately need to address our housing and homelessness crisis.  What is happening, however, is that NAMA is bringing many of these developers to their knees.  In its strategic review, the agency admits that at this stage, it is now having to deal with debtor fatigue, that is, cases where developers are so fed up and worn out from dealing with the State body that they are opting for insolvency or bankruptcy.  It says a great deal about NAMA that many of these developers are running into the arms of vulture funds and taking their chances with the future of their businesses and livelihoods.  It must be pretty terrible for these developers in NAMA.<\/p><p>  Mr. Justice Brian Cregan's High Court judgment in the Flynn case was a damning indictment of NAMA.  He ruled that the State agency had acted unfairly and unlawfully in calling in loans of &euro;22 million from property developer John Flynn and his family.  This case raises serious issues of concern as to how NAMA conducts its business.  Mr. Flynn has been reported as likening the workings of the agency to goings on in North Korea.  In other words, developers under NAMA had better keep their mouths shut.  I have raised on several occasions the need for an Oireachtas oversight committee to bring more transparency to the way in which NAMA does its business.  In fact, such was envisaged when the legislation establishing the agency was introduced by the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  I urge that this oversight committee be put in place.  In the interim, as I have suggested on several occasions, including in the wake of the Flynn judgment, these developers should be brought before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to give their side of the story.  We cannot afford not to listen to what they have to say and learn from it as we seek to avoid another housing bubble and ensure every citizen of this country has a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300050#XX00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1411502700,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputy Barry Cowen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300050#XX00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1411502700,"counter":413,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300050#XX00400","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1411502700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I support the motion before the House.  My party has been very strong on the importance of developing a strong social and private housing sector.  Our spokesperson, Deputy Cowen, launched a policy document earlier this year which stated clearly that every citizen has a right to a home and there must be an all-out effort to tackle the spiralling waiting lists in social housing and the supply shortage in the private sector.  We are falling way behind on the estimated 25,000 units needed per annum.  We hope the Government will, as the Minister has undertaken to do, implement a new home building programme through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, transfer National Asset Management Agency units into social housing, develop housing associations and encourage sustainable levels of construction.<\/p><p>  There is a serious issue of homelessness in this country, which I raised by way of a Topical Issue matter only last week.  I emphasised during that debate that this problem is not unique to Dublin, although it is very serious there, and there are a range of proposals from different sources to tackle it.  COPE Galway, for instance, has proposed an allocation of &euro;500 million for the social housing building programme, with a portion of that ring-fenced to tackle homelessness, particularly in the context of the 2016 Government target to eliminate long-term homelessness and the need to help people who are sleeping rough.  I also referred to the proposal from Dublin City Council that prefabricated buildings be installed on derelict or vacant sites to house homeless families.  There has been significant opposition to that proposal, largely because most people would favour permanent housing for families.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has spoken about refurbishing housing, particularly vacant units in Dublin.  I hope the Government will give serious consideration to these options.  The chief executive officer of ALONE has indicated that 25% of calls to that organisation related to the housing needs of older people.  It is a measure of the seriousness of the problem that more 4,700 older people in this country are in need of housing.<\/p><p>  We now have a situation where 156 families, including 341 children, are living in Dublin hotels.  Brother Kevin Crowley, founder of the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People, has warned of the urgent need for emergency accommodation in the city.  He pointed to the cessation of the night bus service, the provision for which included ring-fenced accommodation.  I hope the very vulnerable people to whom Brother Kevin referred will not be pushed to the bottom when it comes to dealing with the housing crisis.  Every effort must be made to identify housing solutions that could meet their needs.<\/p><p>  Several speakers referred to NAMA's role in addressing the housing shortage.  It would be an important step in the right direction if every local authority were to establish a dedicated NAMA transfer unit.  There has certainly been a shortfall in terms of what was expected from NAMA in this regard.  It would be most welcome if more of its properties could be made available.  A proposal by the leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryan, regarding the use of timber-framed housing would offer a speedy way of providing comfortable and warm accommodation in a sustainable way.<\/p><p>  It is a cause for serious concern that the chief executive of the Merchant's Quay Project observed recently that homelessness in our society was becoming acceptable.<\/p><p>  NAMA is one of the largest property companies in the world and has a major bearing on the recovery of the property market and construction sector by the manner in which it does its business.  I understand the agency is working with local authorities, and the Minister referred to housing units that are in the process of being transferred to local aurh<\/p><p>It is frightening and worrying if we are going to throw our hands in the air and not tackle the situation.  COPE Galway is saying that about 112 families, including 246 children, are either homless or at risk of homelessness.  In Galway city, where people are waiting ten to 12 years for houses, we must act quickly to ensure their concerns are dealt with.<\/p><p> The Department of Social Protection has a policy of setting maximum rent levels under the rent supplement scheme.  It is not based on a review of average rent levels but rather on a view that households on rent supplement should be restricted to the lower end of the rental market.  The current review plans to push such households deeper into the bottom end of the market.  There is no good reason it should be related to the proportion of the total rental market occupied by households on rent supplement and I hope that will be looked at.  Over the past six years, we have attempted to drive down the cost of rent supplement but Government policy has undermined the rent supplement system, so it is no longer reliably providing households with the capacity to sustain their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300050#XX00500","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411503300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I commend my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in for putting forward this motion and assure them of my party's support for its content.  I do so out of respect for the representations it is receiving, no more than ourselves, in this area and I do so also not seeking to question the good faith of that motion.  I refer to a point made by some of the S&iacute;nn F&eacute;in Deputies last week when I brought a Bill forward in Private Members' business.  They could not help themselves but to question the bona fides of my party in bringing forward that Bill.  It was unfortunate that they should do that because we were all elected with the same mandate, namely, to represent those who give us the privilege to do so.  Some of us are given the added responsibility on behalf of our parties to speak on and hold the Government to account in various areas.<\/p><p>  I notice the Minister, Deputy Kelly, has left the House.  He had a lot to say about those of us who were not here when he got up to speak initially.  Thankfully, his speech has been provided to us so we can scrutinise it in our own way.  What I and others have to say is a matter of public record.  I noted that the Minister could not begin to comment in this debate without referring to his belief, and that of many of his colleagues, that the fault for the predicament which we are in lies with previous Governments, in particular Fianna F&aacute;il-led ones, three and a half years after this Government was elected to office and having given commitments to address this issue among many others.  However, that sort of rhetoric and campaigning fell on deaf ears last May and if the Minister continues in that vein, I have no doubt the Labour Party will face similar decimation, and rightly so if that is the sort of politics we can look forward to.<\/p><p>  Construction 2020, to which the Minister alluded, rightly recognises one thing, namely, that supply is the answer to the existing crisis.  It refers to the potential for 75 different actions to address it.  I do not think there is any great need to get into the depth of those actions.  A colleague of mine spoke on Leaders' Questions earlier today and put a solution of one action to the Minister for Finance and that was that &euro;1 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund be put into a strategic fund and be used to launch a new round of home building across the country.  The Government talks about affordability to provide that sort of funding but it was not too shy to raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund when it came to the setting up of Irish Water and to the provision in the State of the new super-quango which is Irish Water.  Some &euro;500 million was taken initially for that purpose.  Up to &euro;180 million was taken for its start-up cost.  We were promised last year that the funds from the local property tax would be available to those who paid it in the areas in which they reside by virtue of the services provided by local authorities but that too was raided and people were sold a pup again.  Some &euro;500 million was taken from that source.  Those were two avenues of funding which could have been used to address this issue.  <\/p><p>  Despite the progress being made by virtue of the sort of policies being pursued and that this Government voted against on numerous occasions prior to taking office, it now wants to take the credit for the marvellous figures which exist on a macro basis, based on the balance sheet and so forth.  We recognise and acknowledge that those indictors are positive and that without them, we could not look forward to the sort of recovery we would all like to see happen and wish people to become part of because they are not part of it now.  Without those indicators, they would have no hope and we acknowledge that.  However, it means nothing when one thinks of this crisis.<\/p><p>  I started by acknowledging the representations members of the Sinn F&eacute;in party are receiving, no more than myself and members of Government parties.  It is the predominant representation a Deputy will hear at his or her clinic.  The provision of housing is at crisis levels and the figures prove it as does the inaction by Government over the past three and a half years.  The mantra was always that the funding model was not available in these straitened times and there was no means by which the Government could generate the sort of revenue required to fund a building programme to address this issue.  <\/p><p>  Last year we built only 8,000 private and public homes but 25,000 are needed.  The crisis is deepening but all the Government can say is that it can do nothing because Fianna F&aacute;il led us down this road and that it will take another term of office to address the issue.  The only thing that jumped out of the Minister's speech, apart from repeating much of what was said in this House before by previous Ministers, was that his absolute priority is to produce a plan.  He is three and a half years in government and he thinks that because he is in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government three months, he has the authority to spend the next 18 months producing a plan on which he thinks he will be re-elected.  Give me a break is the answer to that.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Deputy Kitt, referred to some policy indicators we gave prior to the local elections and which I have repeated on many occasions during Question Time with the previous Ministers, Phil Hogan, and the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I will not waste time or paper outlining 75 actions but will outline four or five which I have done before but which have fallen on deaf ears.  I will repeat them in the hope somebody might take notice.  The Minister, Deputy Kelly, wherever he is, whether sitting having a cup of tea or in his office, slagged me off for not being here at the start of his speech but saw fit to leave the House himself.  However, he can check the record as to our proposals.  His colleagues should have given them to him many months ago.  He should set up a fund to launch a new round of home building across the country.  He should develop voluntary housing associations to a scale where they can access credit and start to build.  He can use the tenant purchase schemes to fund future investment and repair works by local authorities.  He should also allow families on waiting lists to be given the opportunity to move into accommodation which, according to the authorities, is not fit for occupation but which they and their extended families can make fit for purpose and let the rent reflect that thereafter.<\/p><p>  I have heard the talk about NAMA month after month since this Government took office and of getting 2,000 units from NAMA each year.  We should have got 7,000 units by now but how many have we?  The Minister thinks we should stand up and applaud him for getting 700 units.  Where is the social dividend in that?<\/p><p>Where is the leadership required from the Government to extract the social dividend that the people deserve?  I asked for a dedicated team to be established in each local authority to deal specifically NAMA.  That might allow us to see more than the meagre 30 units negotiated at the Church Hill development in Tullamore, which are long overdue.  The Minister spoke about the funding being provided for adapting houses for older persons and the disabled.  In my county, up to 70 people have made representations to me because they are in dire need of funds to adapt their houses to meet medical or age related needs.  The letters they receive from the local authority tell them there is no funding to do this work and that they need not reapply or ask the same questions on the scheme for another three to five years.  That is a reflection of this Government's inaction in housing policy.  Unfortunately, many of the people who are being told to wait three to five years will be in the cemetery when the letter of approval arrives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300051#YY00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411503900,"counter":418,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil an t-&aacute;bhar seo &aacute; phl&eacute; againn anocht mar t&aacute; s&eacute; uaf&aacute;sach in 2014 go bhfuil daoine sa t&iacute;r seo gan teach.<\/p><p>  Mr. Y is in position No. 68 on the housing list.  Mr. and Mrs. X are in position No. 123.  Ms Y, who is need of two-bedroom accommodation, is in position No. 288 and Mr. Z is in position No. 760, on band three of the housing list.  These are the replies to queries from people in need of housing which I am getting daily from Dublin City Council.  There is a housing crisis.  We know there is insufficient housing stock, that rents in the private sector are spiralling and that, for various reasons, landlords are taking back properties that used to be available for rent.  There are also too many voids in Dublin Central.  It is unacceptable that so many flats and houses are lying vacant.  The costs incurred in boarding them up and in dealing with the anti-social behaviour they attract could go instead into releasing them.  If I want to put a new kitchen into my house, decorate a room or build an extension, I can get quotes immediately, and if I have the money I will have a builder who can start the work within a few days and complete it in a timeframe of several weeks.  Why can we not invest the same kind of urgency and money in local authorities in order that voids can be renovated and made fit for people to inhabit?<\/p><p>  In regard to rent allowance, the rents people were paying were far too high for the accommodation they received but instead of putting caps on the rents that landlords could charge, there was a decrease in the rent allowance.  Individuals and families who paid rent to private landlords for several years are facing homelessness because the landlords decided to increase the rent.  This aspect of the housing situation is not being addressed.<\/p><p>  We are told that the economy is moving out of deep recession but the Simon Community, Focus Ireland and Dublin City Council's homeless section report that sections of society are in dire circumstances.  There is a commitment to end long-term homelessness by 2016 but I cannot see it being met.  In the north inner city, poor housing standards are compounded by illegal dumping and poor waste management and collection.<\/p><p>  Rent allowance has to be increased.  It is a short-term measure but it would certainly help.  Homeless budgets have to be maintained.  Brother Kevin in the Capuchin Centre has pointed out that it costs &euro;1.9 million to feed the people who attend its services.  He receives &euro;350,000 from Dublin City Council and &euro;100,000 from the HSE.  One practical step would be to increase his funding.  Fr. Peter McVerry and Brother Kevin were recently given freedom of the city of Dublin.  Both individuals are passionate about homelessness but we are only paying lip service to dealing with it if the people are not being supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1411503900,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I support the motion, which continues the debate we have held over recent months.  On 6 May, the Technical Group used Private Members' business to debate the issue of housing and homelessness because we believed the Government was not serious in its approach or in recognising the crisis that people in our constituencies are facing.  The coalition Government has belatedly come to accept the seriousness of the crisis in housing.  While accepting the crisis in words, its actions, however, fall far short of what is required.  Tinkering around the edges of the problem and continuing to rely on private sector landlords and developers to supply people with affordable housing is not a solution.<\/p><p>  The new housing assistance payment, which will replace the rental allowance from next year, was generally welcomed.  People receiving the new payment will be able to work while continuing to claim the allowance.  However, it was pointed out in this debate that it potentially means recipients can be deemed to have had their housing needs addressed.  The Minister spoke about transfers but that is only going to cause further problems.<\/p><p>  The rental accommodation scheme is a disaster.  In Dublin South Central, people cannot find RAS accommodation and others are losing their RAS accommodation as landlords sell their houses or the banks repossess them.  They have nowhere to go other than private rented accommodation.  They are told they will be first on the list to get RAS accommodation if it becomes available but landlords are not buying into the scheme.<\/p><p>  The private rented sector was encouraged by section 23 breaks to increase its share of housing in Dublin from 19% in 2006 to 32% in 2011.  Apart from being unable to provide people with decent housing at affordable rents, the reliance on the private sector and market forces brought about a banking collapse which sent the country to the brink of ruin.  More than 90,000 households are in need of social housing which does not exist.  Approximately 100,000 households are in mortgage arrears and another 100,000 are renting in an uncontrolled private rented sector without security of tenure and threatened by rent increases.  In the past day, I have dealt with two young families who were threatened with eviction because the bank has taken over their homes and they are being forced to look outside Dublin for accommodation.  This is a serious issue.  Young families are being forced to take their children out of schools.  I do not care what agency is established to provide the money but we know &euro;3 billion is needed to build a minimum of 20,000 houses in the next one to two years if we are to solve the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411503900,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Seanad","time":1411503900,"counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300052#ZZ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1411503900,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill 2014, without amendment, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Bill 2014, without amendment, and the Employment Permits (Amendment) Bill 2014, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014092300052#ZZ00600","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1411503900,"counter":423,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, 24 September 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
