Matters have moved on considerably since we made our written submission in May.  For this reason, we made a supplementary submission this morning.  That submission was drafted with the knowledge of the stimulus plan announced yesterday.  The package announced by the Government does nothing to address the concerns we have regarding the aviation industry in Ireland and the impact on workers in aviation in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In our original written submission, we called for the Government to comply with and enact policies which were in line and consistent with the recommendations and guidance of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.  That has not occurred.  The Government has not adhered to the European guidelines and Ireland is an outlier with regard to its restrictions on travel and the imposition of the so-called green list.  The green list is not aligned with EU health advice.  The Government has put the Canary Islands in the same category as Spain on the green list.  The Canary Islands are roughly the same distance from Spain as Scotland is from Iceland.  There is no public health or scientific logic to the Canary Islands being lumped in with Spain.<\/p><p> Testing and contact tracing, which is the gold standard, is not in place at our airports but it should be.  The nonsense relating to the travel ban is tested by Belfast.  Belfast city and Belfast International Airport have access to 59 countries, as opposed to Dublin having access to 15.  Ireland is, in effect, closed for business.  That said, we respect the Government's decision to undermine and take out the Irish aviation industry and we are now close to the point of no return.  The damage that is being done to the industry is near irreparable.  We have had one casualty so far.  One airline has gone into examinership and has made redundant virtually all of its operational staff in Dublin.  It has started rehiring staff in Denmark because Denmark has pro-employment legislation whereas we have pro-redundancy legislation.  Airline operations have all but ceased.  Thousands of highly skilled, high-paid people in the industry are looking at mortgage foreclosure in the new year.  A loss of circa &euro;8.9 billion of GDP is directly attributable to air transport, along with the loss of 8.8 million tourists, and the loss of cargo and connectivity with 140,000 employed in the sector, directly and indirectly. <\/p><p> Aer Lingus has laid off effectively half their staff and the rest are on half pay, much of which is subsidised by the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  Ryanair has a headline of 20% pay cut but, in effect, the pay cuts are far more drastic than that.  All of Stobart Air's employees are living on social welfare and CityJet, as I mentioned, have made redundant all its crews in Dublin and commenced recruitment in Denmark.  We know that CityJet and Stobart Air applied for assistance from the Government.  We have not seen the reply but we believe nothing has been offered by the Government. <\/p><p> Ireland is an outlier in terms of travel restrictions and in its refusal to give assistance to the industry aside from the TWSS, which every other country is doing.  In my supplementary submission, I set out all of the assistance that European governments have given to airlines on top of the equivalent of the TWSS.  It is important to note that &euro;30 billion in state support has been granted to European airlines.  Ireland has contributed zero of that &euro;30 billion.  In the UK, British Airways, BA, received a &pound;300 million credit facility on top of the equivalent of TWSS.  The UK Government has given both Ryanair and EasyJet a &pound;600 million credit facility.  Spain, the home of Iberia and Vueling, has given a &euro;1 billion state-backed loan on the provision of no redundancies.  The Netherlands has given &euro;3 billion to KLM, France has given &euro;7 billion to Air France while Germany has given Lufthansa &euro;9 billion in assistance.  Aer Lingus has not received a cent from the Government.  While we have the most restrictive travel policy, we have also had the least generous response - if not zero generosity - from the Government to assist us in this crisis.<\/p><p> Aer Lingus is one of a number of airlines that is wholly owned by International Airlines Group, IAG, which is registered in Spain but headquartered in London.  BA, Iberia and Vueling are others in the group but there are also smaller airlines in IAG.   Most of these operate under the brand of LEVEL, but one is Anisec, which is LEVEL in Austria.  That has filed for bankruptcy and we understand it is being liquidated.  OpenSkies in France, a small airline operating under the LEVEL brand-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We will hear from Aer Lingus next Tuesday, or at least we hope to, so I ask Mr. Cullen to make his concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#C00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>In short, it is our contention that as IAG retreats in the face of this crisis it is liquidating the smaller airlines in order to save its pillar airlines.  Those are British Airways, BA, which the British Government will back and Iberia which the Spanish Government will absolutely back.  Unfortunately Ireland does not back Aer Lingus with any assistance other than the temporary wage subsidy scheme, which every other western EU country has done.  We are asking for the Government to step up to the plate and take off the handcuffs.  Both of our hands are very firmly handcuffed and we have been thrown into the river because the Government is telling people not to travel and at the same time it will not assist the very airlines that need travel in order to survive.  This is absolutely an emergency.  We believe things are almost at the point of no return and in the new year when this economy needs an airline industry to restart its connectivity and its economy there will not be one to bring back.  To give one example, almost every pilot in Ireland has lost their pilot's licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cullen for his opening remarks and his very stark warning.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Neil McGowan from SIPTU to make his opening remarks.

Flights and passenger numbers have collapsed and are between 90% to 99% down on what one would expect.  Even with the assistance of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, workers in aviation have suffered a cut in wages ranging from 20% to 70%.  Hundreds of aviation workers are on temporary layoff and are relying solely on State supports.  The outlook for the aviation sector in the short to medium term is bleak.  Any possibility of summer green shoots have failed to materialise and workers are now facing into a long winter.  Despite a dramatic drop in earnings, workers in aviation continued to keep essential supply chains going through the darkest days of the pandemic.  SIPTU members in the airlines, ground handlers and airport workers played a critical front-line role in keeping our airports open for essential deliveries of PPE and medical supplies.<\/p> <p>  In order to ensure Ireland has an aviation industry post-Covid-19 a number of actions need to be immediately taken by the Government.  SIPTU recommends the extension of the TWSS for the aviation sector until summer 2021 to ensure that employment is maintained in the industry.  The extension of the TWSS must be made conditional on several binding commitments from the employers.  These include no worker being made redundant on a compulsory basis while the employer is benefiting from the TWSS.  This omission was a fatal error on the part of Government when the scheme was introduced given that these companies were benefiting from State support to keep people employed.  The purpose of the scheme was to maintain the link between the employee and the employer so that when we came out the far end of the pandemic we would have an industry to try to build upon.  The fact that employers can and have made people redundant on a compulsory basis is simply unacceptable.  We are also seeking a binding commitment from employers that while the employer is benefiting from the TWSS no worker will suffer a permanent reduction in any terms and conditions of employment unless by collective agreement.  We also ask that workers, where they wish, can make contributions to pension schemes while on the TWSS.  Currently, workers are unable to make the employee contribution to their pension schemes from the TWSS.  The longer this goes on, the more we will be storing up a pension problem.  Many aviation workers have suffered dramatic cuts in their pensions over the last decade and have moved from defined-benefit schemes into defined-contribution schemes.<\/p> <p>  SIPTU recommends that Shannon Airport be returned to the management of the DAA.  The separation of Shannon Airport has not been a success and this was apparent prior to the Covid crisis.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 crisis has brought into question the long-term viability of the airport.  Given its absolute importance to the region's economy, we believe it must be brought back into the management of the DAA.  When one compares the experience of Cork Airport with that of Shannon Airport since separation, it is quite stark that last year Cork was the fastest-growing airport in the country while Shannon has failed to progress and its viability is seriously in question at the moment.<\/p><p> SIPTU also recommends the introduction of a rapid testing facility for all airport workers.  By the very nature of their work, airport workers are brought into close contact with people from across the world as they enter and leave the country.  It is essential that a rapid testing facility be introduced in all the airports but particularly so in Dublin Airport in the short term.  It is a serious deficit.  We are calling for a review of the non-State airport sector, namely the regional airports such as Kerry Airport, Knock Airport and Donegal Airport.  If the State is to give State aid to those airports then it should take an ownership share in them.<\/p><p> SIPTU believes the public health advice that continues to restrict international travel must be followed.  Where, however, there is a corresponding impact on employment then the level of payment of the wage subsidy scheme should be established to ensure that workers' net take home pay is at a level that allows them to meet their financial obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGowan.

On the basis of the scientific data we are satisfied that passenger-to-passenger does not occur.  The ventilation systems on the aircraft are designed to deal with lots of viruses and diseases.  The aircraft built by Boeing and Airbus are designed to be sold and operated all over the world where there are highly-transmissible and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.  Therefore the filters and air conditioning used are specifically designed to prevent passenger-to-passenger transmission.<\/p><p>That is why we urgently need rigorous testing at the airports both for departure and arrival.  Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall asked an interesting parliamentary question about the level of follow-up on the passenger locator forms.

It is important to note that we are in the early stages in this process.  As I said in my opening statement we are heading into the winter which is traditionally a quieter time in the aviation industry.  It is traditionally a time when the airport and airlines do not make money, even in normal times.  This is compensated for by the busy summer months.  However, this year that has not come to fruition.  Any expectation that people had that the situation would improve dramatically in July and August has not happened.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Dublin Airport campus, 2,500 redundancies is probably the thin edge of the wedge.  I have already referenced Swissport which has indicated it is seeking to make 52% of its staff in the UK redundant.  That would transfer into an additional 400 redundancies here.  Shannon Airport is seeking an unspecified number of redundancies.  There are other industries that are dependent on aviation, such as the aviation repair industry which is heavily based around Shannon Airport.  The people who work in that area are currently working half time in the main.  While the planes are not flying they will not to be maintained.  The problems for that industry are probably several months away.  Unless we have direct intervention from the State in the form of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and in the form of assistance to the airports, the third party handlers and the airlines the figure of 2,500 to 3,000 will look very modest as we head into January and February of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGowan.

It is clear that the single greatest tool we have in our fight against Covid-19 is quarantine and the restriction on movement.  Aviation is the exact opposite of this, regardless of what might be said on the evidence base.  It is a question of the lack of quality of our evidence base rather than it not existing.  The virus is spread by the movement of people and the aviation sector and travel involves such movement.  That challenge must be squared.  The Government seems not to have persuaded people of the model it is proposing.  I believe there is a lack of confidence among communities and even within Government.  Given that we have we have the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, data, we have European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, guidelines, will Mr. Cullen outline what model he would like to see implemented?

We are in the risk business.  In every airline and in every aviation industry there is a balance to a debate about the risk and what is done to mitigate that risk.  I would say there is a lack of counterbalance in the information the Government is receiving at the moment.  Notwithstanding that, the Government has taken a view and we accept it is entitled to take that view, but one cannot put us out of business by restricting our ability to do our business and then not assist us.  My argument is quite simple: if the Government is going to impose the most restrictive regime on travel in western Europe it will also need to do the other things to make sure we still have an industry when this crisis passes.

They certainly do not offer the quality connectivity on which we in the mid-west, and particularly Shannon Airport, are reliant.  Ireland cannot be the outlier of Europe.  The R-nought has now crept back into \"acceptable\" levels, and I welcome the announcement of this by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, yesterday.  I use inverted commas because it was at 1.8 last week and is now around 1.4.  I am aware that in Britain this morning the rate is around 0.8 or 0.9.  There is a country that has a lower R-nought rate than Ireland.  This green list needs to be very fluid.  It cannot be reviewed on a fortnightly basis, it has to be very fluid and we need more certainty so people can get in and out with quality connectivity.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the Aer Lingus temporary lay-off of staff.

How is Ireland differing from other countries in what they have to offer on inbound and outbound screening right to the departure gates?  Is there a difference between airlines also?  Surely there are some PPE requirements and guidance offered on aeroplanes apart from the information on how the passenger must clip his or her life vest and how to wear the oxygen mask.  Surely there is some guidance or is Ireland an outlier in this regard also?  Will the witnesses answer that?<\/p> <p>  There is another huge issue we have not focused on.  I believe that the whole focus has been on Dublin Airport recently.<\/p><p>Some 130,000 passengers have arrived in Dublin Airport since the start of the month but only 8,600 passengers landed in Shannon Airport in May.  That is a major disparity and everyone needs to be mindful of that, including the Government and those who speak for workers and the sector.  We need to look at bringing Shannon Airport back under the remit of the Dublin Airport Authority.<\/p><p> I will bundle my final questions.  I would like to hear more about the filtration system.  I have seen people wear masks on aeroplanes in years gone by because they believed they would get a head cold while flying.  Is that an old wives' tale?  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that.<\/p><p> Aer Lingus has a nice fleet of Airbus A320neo jets.  I understand that at Dublin Airport, 40 fewer passengers than the allowable capacity board these aircraft because the runway does not allow for a fully-loaded A320neo jet to take off.  Those are my few points.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the reason we are outliers, the Shannon Airport versus Dublin Airport disparity, filtration systems and the A320neo jet issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#L00300","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I will address the seniority issue regarding the temporary lay-offs in Shannon Airport.

Regarding the SIPTU members laid off in the areas in which we engage in collective bargaining in Aer Lingus, the long-standing arrangement is that it is done on a section by section basis and that seniority is then the determining factor.  The reality, however, is that Aer Lingus has not had operations out of Shannon since March.  That needs to change quickly.  I welcome the Deputy's support for our position on Shannon Airport returning to the remit of the DAA.  If there is to be work for people in Shannon, there must be flights and connectivity to valuable routes.

If that is something that is going to come to fruition, we will be eager to engage with it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the negotiations concerning no compulsory redundancies, as I said earlier, I believe that the DAA has gone about this process in the correct way.  Very early in the discussions between the unions and the company, compulsory redundancies were ruled out and a voluntary severance package was made available.  We believe there is sufficient interest in that voluntary severance package for the company to achieve the reduction in numbers with which it wishes to move ahead.<\/p><p>That has not been the experience in every other company.  We have yet to engage with Aer Lingus, despite it having been several weeks since it wrote to the Minister informing the Department that it was seeking to make 500 people in the non-pilot grades redundant.  There is a very real worry in Aer Lingus that compulsory redundancies are something we will face in the very short term.  It has been a long-standing position of SIPTU that compulsory redundancies are simply unacceptable.  It is a road we have never gone down before, but it is a real fear that we might be facing into that in the immediate future in Aer Lingus.<\/p><p> Equally, among the third-party handlers, while many of them have engaged with the unions, there has been little in the way of meaningful negotiations.  Several such employers are seeking to take advantage of the pandemic.  One particular employer at Dublin Airport, with which we have a long-standing collective agreement dating back to 1996, is seeking to alter the terms of that in respect of public holiday entitlements, annual leave entitlements and sick pay entitlements, which I find reprehensible given the time we are in.

What is unique about Aer Lingus and other Irish airlines is that there is no Government assistance for them, whereas the UK Government is assisting at least one Irish airline that we know of and other governments throughout Europe are doing the same for their airlines.  The USA has poured enormous amounts of cash into its airline industry because it does not want it to go down.  The Irish Government, for reasons we do not understand, is excluding its aviation industry from support, including in the stimulus plan that was announced yesterday.

I have been calling for rapid testing at our airports for nearly two months, a call which has gone unheeded by the Government.<\/p><p>This can be done, and has been done, in various other countries throughout the world.  The mandatory quarantine is not being enforced here.  Visitors from high-risk countries are travelling freely around Ireland.  This increases the likelihood of Covid-19 spreading and causing more devastation to our country and economy.  Airports could remain open to visitors if we took certain measures.  First, high-risk visitors should be tested before coming to Ireland.  They should provide recent medical certificates showing they are free of Covid-19.  Countries such as Austria and the Czech Republic are doing this.  A traveller entering the United Arab Emirates must provide a negative Covid-19 test result, meaning no financial burden falls on that state.<\/p><p> Second, visitors who arrive without medical certificates should undergo mandatory testing at their own expense on arrival in Ireland.  Some countries, such as Iceland, charge visitors a fee on arrival to cover tests.  Many Irish people are scared to go to tourist areas in their own county this summer because they are worried that these areas are quickly becoming Covid-19 hotspots.  Ensuring visitors are tested before arrival, or on arrival at their own expense, will help to protect Irish citizens without causing a significant burden on the State.  Last Sunday I witnessed the strictness with which other countries apply their rules first-hand.  I dealt with the case of a very ill young person whose parent had to fly to be at their bedside in America immediately.  No matter how we tried, the parent could not fly out on Sunday as he had to be Covid-19 tested.  He had to jump many more fences before he could be at his son's bedside.  If that took place here, up until now the traveller would get a pat on the back and be left to it.  A traveller fills in a form and we wish them the best of luck.  Rapid testing should be done in our airports to reopen Ireland.  It is a simple no-brainer.  We need tourism to reopen in a meaningful way in south-west Cork.  I can see the devastation caused by that not happening.<\/p><p> I refer to two short emails from some of my constituents.  These are just two of the hundreds I have received in recent weeks.  One constituent notes that it is surely madness to permit American tourists to fly into Ireland without enforcing the 14-day isolation rule.  If it cannot be strictly enforced, my constituent states that the Government owes it to Irish citizens to stop them from entering the country.  We have sacrificed so much during the lockdown, and to waste it all through unsupervised tourism is totally reckless.  Irish people can be fined or jailed for breaking the Covid-19 laws but there is no penalty for tourists who refuse to quarantine.  <\/p><p> The second email expresses concern about reports of American tourists entering and travelling around Ireland without any restriction.  The reports suggest that none of them is isolating.  My correspondent writes that this is an insult to the people of this country who went into lockdown.  Thousands lost their jobs, but they did it willingly to protect the citizens of this country.  My constituent believes that allowing visitors from the most infected country in the world to arrive on our shores is an absolute disgrace and, more important, it puts our front-line workers in danger.  The Government must step up to the mark and either ban American tourists or put more stringent measures in place. <\/p><p> What advice should I give to people who send me messages like this on an ongoing basis?

We have no difficulty with testing people before they travel to Ireland.  We have no difficulty with parts of the USA and Europe not being on the green list.  However, a balance must be struck.  There must be a counterbalance to this argument.  Ireland has deviated from the recommendations of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.  We are interested in the reason for these deviations.  It has never been explained to us.  There seems to be a lack of balance in the entire debate.  The sooner we have robust testing regimes, robust passenger location follow-up and a holistic plan of action, the better.

Our guests have painted a very stark picture for their industry.  The message we need to take back to the Government is that this is an industry in crisis and in need of support and intervention.  Our guests have documented the supports they have had in Europe.  We are an island nation, depend on the aviation sector, and must stand shoulder to shoulder with our guests at the moment.<\/p> <p>  There is a conversation about aviation occurring at present.  We have a green list of countries that has been much criticised but the general, unchanged message from the Government has been that people should not travel unless it is essential.  That has engendered a conversation about travel in many homes across Ireland.  I wish to ask a specific question which I will frame now and expand on the detail thereafter.  My question is about people who have flights booked for August and right up until schools go back at the beginning of September.  Other people had flights booked during June and July and did not receive refunds.  Are our guests in a position to give us some indication of the value of those flights and the numbers of people who were affected?  <\/p> <p>  As I said, conversations are under way in homes and fall into two distinct groups.  There are families who worked assiduously for the past year and saved money for a holiday into which they put a lot of faith and expectation.  They worked doubly hard and perhaps took on a part-time job to pay for the holiday.  They may have faced illness or bereavement in their households.  There may be children in those households who are in difficulty in school or with societal issues.  Those families had invested hope and expectation in the holiday they booked.  Those people had no choice.  They felt obliged to take the flight with a heavy heart and sense of shame that they were going abroad.  They were unable to post pictures to social media or say that they had a nice time.  They then had to self-isolate when they came home.  Another group of people went through the same rigours of saving money for their holidays but were able to take the decision, in the interest of the national public health and for the welfare and well-being of their communities and neighbours, to not travel abroad.  Those are the two cohorts of people about whom I am speaking.<\/p> <p>  We are building up to an expectation that our schools will return in September, which is important for child welfare and development.  It is also very important for Ireland Inc. that our schools resume in September because we need to send a strong message to Europe and investors that we are open for business.  We cannot countenance a situation where we are the last country in Europe that has not got its children back to school.  For that reason, it is important that families should not feel pressurised to get on an aeroplane between now and the end of August.<\/p> <p>  I asked a parliamentary question of the Minister during the week and was left with reasonable hope from his reply that there may be consideration given to a refund scheme for the people affected.  I am interested to know if our guests are able to offer any insight into the scale of what might be involved in that refund scheme.  I would appreciate any detail on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#V00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy's question is best kept for the representatives of the airlines who I understand are coming in next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Evan Cullen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>That information is not available to the trade unions.

Protections are in place in the Payment of Wages Act and legislative protections were also introduced for Shannon Airport workers when the airport was separated.  Shannon Airport needs to move back within management of the DAA.  The project of Shannon Airport as a stand-alone entity has failed.

According to this submission, conditions are attached to state support given to Iberia, KLM and Air France such that those airlines cannot change workers' conditions, they have to protect jobs and they cannot create redundancies.

I have a brief statement, as the Chairman asked.  The NBRU, as the foremost front-line trade union, welcomes the opportunity to speak here today.  I extend my condolences to all those who have been affected by this virus and to the families of the people who have lost their lives.  The coronavirus has completely changed our world, as has been said many times.  The reality of what passed as a so-called normal life in February 2020 has disappeared.  As a society, we are now transforming into a new normal across many facets of how we go about our daily schedules.<\/p> <p>  Public transport, similar to other sectors, has changed dramatically from what it was previously.  It should be noted and acknowledged that front-line transport workers have operated throughout the crisis in a manner that deserves the gratitude of all.  Similar to all our front-line public service workers, they have been at the coalface, providing an essential service when many others disappeared.  The valuable contribution from State-owned companies has acted as a beacon throughout the crisis.  It is fortunate that workers' representatives such as the NBRU and other representative colleagues have been highlighting the value of having State-owned companies for many years.<\/p><p>The praise being heaped upon those same companies today should not allow for those who seek to undermine the companies to be let off the hook.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a so-called commercial service with the most inappropriate name, Expressway.  Like a myriad of other operators, it has continued to operate throughout the crisis, ferrying essential workers to their places of work.  Many work in vital health services, others in essential retailer services, pharmacies, doctors' surgeries and retail services.  In large parts of Ireland, many towns, villages and far-flung communities would have been left isolated and cut off were it not for Bus &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p> The reality is that Bus &Eacute;ireann, not least because of its public ownership, would have been left isolated and cut off if it had done as others did and decided to step away from operating services.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a social contract with its citizens.  That should not be assumed as a given.  The development of the motorway network and the increase in travel on interurban corridors created by these motorways springing up around the country brought an influx of mainly multinational companies to the market.  One might think that if demand increases, supply needs to be increased too.  However, we contend that the market is not there.  It was saturated as a result of oversupply and this was done to drive Bus &Eacute;ireann away from the commercial service that it is supposed to operate.<\/p><p> There are many other issues that I wish to cover and I hope the questions will allow me to do so.  I will make two points.  The recent debacle with face masks demonstrated clearly that input from front-line representatives such as the NBRU and other colleagues was severely lacking in the decision-making process.  I do not know how much correspondence we wrote to relevant authorities, mainly the National Transport Authority but also the operating companies, seeking a place at the decision-making table where the face mask issue could have been dealt with much better than how it was ultimately dealt with.  We have been calling for that since 1 May.<\/p><p> Capacity on public transport has reached 50%, up from 20%, and while public health advice will dictate the future of that, we cannot go back to the crushed loads that we had on buses and trains before the Covid crisis.  I am heartened by one element in the programme for Government, namely, the commitment to establishing a stakeholders' forum at long last.  Those people who shun us and treat us with disdain have nothing to be afraid of when it comes to the NBRU sitting at a table.  We do not want to own public transport.  We just want to influence and bring our expertise to bear.  After all, without front-line transport staff, the transport system does not operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am trying to touch the bell so that people know when they have a minute left because there were some difficulties this morning.

While we are all independent groups and have previously had different priorities, we feel it is important that we unite today for drivers' welfare and present this submission.  The small public service industry has been decimated and almost all who qualify for pandemic payments continue to need them.  The groups' members are small public service vehicle licence-holders throughout Ireland, including in major cities and smaller towns and villages.  The industry is made up of approximately 20,000 vehicles, 90% of them taxis, while the rest are hackneys and limousines.  There are approximately 26,000 qualified drivers with small public service vehicle, SPSV, licences.  We represent more than 13,000 of those drivers.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to present directly to this committee as we believe the drivers operating in the industry are being overlooked and not sufficiently supported by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority during this pandemic.  The effects of the pandemic are unprecedented and the consequences for our industry are unknown.  We will need ongoing direct support from the Government to ensure viability for 20,000 vehicles, licence-holders and their families, who depend on them driving a taxi to make a living while providing an integral part of the public transport service.  Indirectly, many thousands depend on the SPSV industry.  The industry is not only an integral part of the transport system, it is essential.<\/p><p>It is the only door-to-door public transport serving airports, hospitals, train stations, sports events, business communities, tourism and also those with special needs.  We rely on each other for success.  The SPSV fleet includes 2,700 wheelchair accessible vehicles.  Our industry is facing many challenges, including financial and practical challenges.  We have been a positive contributor to the overall economy and the only section of public transport to contribute financially to the NTA, with approximately &euro;5 million per year on licences.<\/p><p> I will not go through the entire submission as there is not sufficient time and I will welcome questions, but I wish to outline some key headings.  We believe the Government should immediately stop the issuing of new licences.  Grants must be provided and we need step-down payments for drivers going back to work.  The vehicle age limits of vehicles must be extended and a buy-back scheme must be introduced to allow transferability.  The fare increase that was recommended in 2019 needs to be implemented and we need help to introduce cashless payments.  We want to be considered for Government transport contracts.  Grants to other business enterprises should include a section to be specifically designed for the SPSV industry.  All future events should consider the appropriateness of how many taxis are required.  Face masks and visors should be made mandatory for people getting into a taxi.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.

I am here with the team from the National Private Hire and Taxi Association and the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation.  Some of our main concerns include the advantage taken by companies particularly with regard to Dublin Airport through the Covid-19 pandemic.  They say they are not going to deal with representatives and they have cut all negotiations.  In essence, they are taking us from the rule books in respect of Dublin Airport, which is very concerning.<\/p> <p>  The NTA has not looked for guidelines from taxi representative groups.  We have had very little correspondence from the taxi advisory committee.  There has been no implementation for taxi drivers going back to work with regard to screens or otherwise.  We have not been made a part of the mandatory wearing of face masks in public transport.  The statutory instrument does not cover taxis, which is very poor in that regard.  We will look for the NTA to provide stimulus throughout the country through HSE work, school transport and the rural link.  We had very positive meetings with Ms Anne Graham, Mr. Hugh Creegan and Ms Margaret Malone on rural transport.  They came back to us with a stimulus to activate rural transport with rural hackneys but we said that taxis are needed in that area as well.<\/p> <p>  Now is the time to bring taxis under the remit of the NTA because it seems that during the entire crisis we have been cannon fodder.  The authority says we are front-line workers but has given us no remit for any guidelines in that regard.<\/p><p>There was a very simple task that could have been done by the NTA if it had proper representation on the taxi advisory committee.  The taxi advisory committee has not given us any indication as to what is happening.  It has become like a secret society in respect of the taxi industry with one representative on it.  There were poor actions by Mr. Shane Ross at the beginning of this pandemic relating to the industry.  I think he only met taxi groups three or four times during his term.  We ask the new Minister with responsibility for transport to take some time and listen to what the taxi representative groups have done and to start a new advisory group including those groups where they get proper information from proper individuals, not second-hand information coming from people outside the industry.  No industry should have a majority of people from companies giving advice.  Advice should be coming from people on the ground.  We ask for the disbandment of the current taxi advisory committee and the appointment of a new committee where the majority of taxi drivers' voices throughout the country can be heard.<\/p><p> I refer to the decimation in rural areas and towns across Ireland.  They need stimulus.  They rely on tourism for growth.  There will be no tourism with current growth.  Individuals will drive from their houses to hotels and use their own cars to do that.  The stimulus for taxi drivers in that scenario is non-existent.

Prior to Covid, 82% of people said they only had to wait less than ten minutes for a taxi.  We want to keep that service.  If we do not get the grants and supports we will be going back to the old days whereby people were waiting 40 minutes or an hour standing at a taxi rank.  We do not want that; we want to continue to provide what is classed as one of the most professional taxi services in the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#LL00050","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Waldron"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Mr. Waldron raised the issue of insurance, which I had hoped to address.

There was a very simple way for the National Transport Authority to achieve that at the outset of Covid-19.  Most insurance companies and the National Transport Authority recommend the use of the driver check app.  The NTA could have taken every driver off the driver check app.  There are several reasons why some taxi drivers have stayed working.  They could have remained on their taxi policy but stayed out of work, which would have made for a simpler process for coming back to work.  It is down to the advice that was given.  If we were there, we would have given this advice and it would have been a simpler process.  The insurance companies could simply have gone on to the driver check app to make sure a driver was off it.  Many drivers had to stay out working because they were already on the back to work scheme for social welfare purposes.  There is a step-down process in that regard.

Grants will definitely need to be provided.  I do not see loans as the answer.  Loans only put things on the long finger.  It is very difficult for a driver to earn money at the moment.  There is no opportunity to earn an income.  We are already becoming liable for our car loans, as the three-month moratorium on the payment of loans is coming to an end and we do need support.<\/p> <p>  Drivers on the Covid payment are afraid to go to work, first, for health reasons but, second, because they feel they will immediately lose their income.  Every driver sitting at home now wants to go to work and taxi drivers are thinking about how they can do so.  If they go to work now, they must give up the Covid payment.  That is a choice they must make.  It is a choice no driver wants to make because taxi drivers do not know what is ahead of them.  We suggest that if a driver goes back to work that over a period he or she would get a step-down payment.  That way, drivers can work towards getting an income and they are not afraid to go out.  If that were the case, we would not be relying on the full &euro;350 and it could be reduced gradually.<\/p> <p>  Grants definitely have to be paid.  Several issues arise in terms of payments drivers have to make.  Mr. Macken mentioned the DAA earlier.  It charges &euro;440 a year for a permit to operate at Dublin Airport.  Approximately 1,500 taxis work out of Dublin Airport and the drivers have to pay the &euro;440 upfront.  A grant is necessary.<\/p> <p>  Leaving our figure aside, the National Transport Authority's fare review, which was carried out last year, stated that Dublin taxi drivers have a fixed cost of &euro;11,433.  They are not the running costs.  We have to come up with &euro;11,000 this year to pay for those fixed costs and we need supports, so the grants are necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#MM00050","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Waldron"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Out of interest, does Mr. Waldron know how many taxi drivers are over the age of 66 and, thereby, not eligible for the Covid payment?

The current waiting time for a taxi from Dublin Airport, where there are 30 or 40 taxis, is up to three or four hours, to facilitate a service there.  There are long waits at Dublin Airport and the taxis are waiting for whatever the reason might be.<\/p> <p>  Advantage is being taken by Dublin Airport in respect of Covid-19.  I have emailed the leaders of each of the political parties - I might have missed one but I think I got them all - about the ongoing discussions with the CEO of the DAA, Mr. Dalton Philips, because we have been totally ignored at Dublin Airport as a representative group.  Mr. Phillips does not want to deal with us any more and he has emailed back all the leaders about the matter.  I hope we will get political representation to respond to the arrogant way we are being treated at the airport.  We will meet the leaders soon and, hopefully, if political persuasion can take place, we can put the case as to how taxis should operate at Dublin Airport.  There are no guidelines at Dublin Airport.  The taxi holding area has no facilities or instructions relating to Covid-19.  There are no hand-washing facilities or soap in any of the toilets.

Will they speak to their views on how the NTA engages with the taxi service in general?  I specifically refer to structures like the taxi advisory committee.  What are the advantages and disadvantages in the context of the Covid-19 crisis?  When we put questions to the former Minister, Shane Ross, a few weeks ago, the NTA put forward a view that there is nothing wrong and it has great engagement with the taxi industry.  It implied representatives met all the time, there was a back-and-forth discussion and there were many plans and irons in the fire.  Speaking with taxi drivers in my constituency and beyond, that does not seem to be the case.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Macken expand on his point replying to an earlier contributor with regard to Dublin Airport, permits and the issues being faced in that regard?  He ran out of time so if he wants to continue on the point, I am interested in the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#QQ00100","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Dublin Airport initially sought the &euro;440 upfront and that would have needed to be paid in the coming month.  It has now given us a bit of leeway by pushing out the payment to September.  Before that we would have had quarterly payments and forum meetings once per month in which we could put across our concerns.  The previous landside standards manager, Mr. Anthony McGarry, dealt with us reasonably well in the taxi industry and there was always somebody at the end of the phone for any major incidents at Dublin Airport.  That was until we saw the impact of Covid-19, when all interaction with the taxi representative groups was taken away.  As I stated, I contacted Mr. Dalton Philips and there is a string of emails back and forth.  He states that he started a workshop and that taxi drivers indicated they wanted to be contacted individually, which is totally not the case.  The person who ran this, Margaret Cox, emphasised there should be more engagement with the taxi industry.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the NTA and the taxi advisory committee, the former Minister, Shane Ross, told our colleagues that he was not responsible for picking the taxi representatives.  The NTA has no input into the taxi advisory committee at all.  There is one representative from Tiom&aacute;na&iacute; Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann on it for the taxi industry.  The remaining members are from dispatch operator companies, including Free Now, Lynk and the Galway representative for dispatch operators.  The representative groups have very little input into this.  There is very little input coming back from the taxi industry.<\/p> <p>  It beggars belief that there is a new taxi regulator.  We sent an email to who we thought was the regulator only to find out, by accident, that there is a new one.  That is the way we are being treated by the NTA.  We are being told nothing and kept in the dark.  We are being used as cannon fodder.  There should have been major discussions.  Ms Anne Graham has said there is great interaction, but that is within a committee.  The taxi advisory committee has started a subcommittee to advise the main committee on Covid-19, which beggars belief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Macken"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that the voice of the ordinary taxi driver is not being heard proportionately in any way on the taxi advisory committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#RR00100","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>That is the case 110%.

My time is short and I specifically asked that the taxi drivers attend today, so I will fire most of my questions at them.  They have been ignored.  However, I will quickly put a question to Mr. O'Leary.  The subsidies for public transport in Ireland were lower than almost anywhere else in Europe before Covid.  For the public's benefit, will Mr. O'Leary say how low they were and how Covid has added dramatically to the case that we must have a substantial increase in them, given that public transport is now more essential than ever?<\/p> <p>  I will put the rest of my questions to the taxi drivers' representatives.  It is obvious that taxi drivers have been ignored and are being treated with contempt by the NTA.  Now, their industry has been decimated and there is no roadmap - pardon the pun - back for them in the current period.  All of the associated elements - tourism, live entertainment and music, bars and so on - that would have given them the possibility of having some sort of sustainable income are on the floor as well.  Will the witnesses state the case for why the income subsidy to allow people to return to work is so crucial?  Do they agree that the failure to extend the pandemic payment to people aged over 66 years put the affected taxi drivers in a very dangerous position in terms of their health and that, even now, taxi drivers are caught in a terrible bind?  If they return to work, they will lose their payments but they cannot earn a decent living in the current situation.  If they remain on the pandemic payment, however, it will be cut and cut again.  Indeed, it has already been cut.  This puts them in a dilemma.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the number of taxis.  Before Covid, there were more taxis in Dublin than there were in New York.  The idea that the NTA would continue to issue licences for new taxis when the industry is on the floor seems crazy.  Perhaps the taxi drivers' representatives could elaborate on this.  They might also comment on the appeal for the same large stimulus grants that are being given to some businesses to be given to taxi drivers as well to cover the &euro;11,000 of annual fixed costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#SS00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":295,"content":"<p>All of the licences issued by the NTA related to wheelchair-accessible grants.

The National Transport Authority, NTA, should have considered the pandemic and looked at some way of returning from it.  It is not only the old age pensioners who have had to return to work who have been affected by Covid-19 but people on back-to-work schemes as well.  A significant amount of these are on the second tranche of payments.  The back-to-work scheme runs for three years.  They have no option to get out of it either.  They have to subsidise their income as well.  <\/p><p> There should be an immediate moratorium on the issuing of plates.  We will have a majorly oversupplied industry if there is no tourism across the country.

He is right; drivers have been put in a very delicate situation.  They have to make a choice between their health and their finances.  There is no support for people with mental health issues.  The has created stress for people throughout Ireland.  It has not just affected taxi drivers but, because I am talking about taxi drivers, what has the Government put in place to support them?

I will speak primarily to the NBRU submission.  While I have an interest in taxis, I have a greater interest in public transport, specifically the rail and bus side of it.<\/p><p>I represent Kildare North, which is very much a commuter constituency.  Pre-Covid, the bulk of the working population in north Kildare migrated into the greater Dublin area most mornings, returning again in the evening.  I have been a commuter on public transport, primarily rail, for upwards of 20 years.  I will make a couple of observations on that.  The numbers using the system have started to increase again.  The system was almost at breaking point pre-Covid.  I discussed this in the past with Mr. O'Leary and others in the NBRU, as well as the NTA, Irish Rail and all the other stakeholders.  We are dealing with the crisis as best we can around the table.  It is important not to lose sight of the pressures on the system pre-Covid, for example, trains and buses running above capacity, a lack of park-and-ride facilities, parking and other supporting services needed to make the transition to public transport <i>en masse<\/i>.  Unfortunately, this transition has been somewhat arrested but I hope we will be in a post-Covid era in the not too distant future, whether that is in six, 12 or 18 months.  We cannot let this slide as we could find ourselves back to capacity again very quickly.  It is important that we do not let the ball drop on some of the initiatives and projects that were up and running to address some of the issues in public transport.<\/p><p>Earlier this week, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, announced EU funding for the Kildare route project to bring the DART to Maynooth and Hazelhatch.  Without being parochial, as someone who lives one station further, I believe this should extend much further to stations such as Sallins and Newbridge, as well as Kilcock on the Sligo line, and perhaps even Enfield.  If we were being pedantic, we would describe the Kildare route project as the Dublin route project because it stops at Hazelhatch, which is in County Dublin.  While the pressure and focus are elsewhere, it is important that we do not forget these issues.  We need to keep them boiling away in the background as best we can.<\/p><p>I spoke about capacity in normal times and my hope that we return to some kind of normalcy soon.  I have continued to travel on public transport on most days during the pandemic.  Last Thursday, when we had a late session in the convention centre, I ran to get a later train home at 8 p.m. or 8.30 p.m.  Even at that off-peak hour, social distancing was almost impossible to enforce because the seats were almost full.  While there were signs and stickers on the seats, it was not possible to observe social distancing because the train was beginning to fill up.  That is already an issue and we are only at the early stages of people returning to work.  I do not know how that will be managed.  I note there was some reduction on timetables.  Perhaps it is time to start ramping up services again as people start taking the train again.  This has probably gone under the radar but it will become an issue very soon.<\/p><p>The return of schools has been the subject of considerable concern, coverage, speculation and analysis in the media, the Government and these Houses.  We have heard a lot about schools, but what about the school buses?  I am not sure how the school bus system will cope when the schools return.  There is always pressure to get places on school buses in August.  Much depends on capacity on particular routes and whether the school bus seats 48 or 60, the number of discretionary places and so on.  In a social distancing era, what kind of challenges will that pose?<\/p><p>It is something that has not been flagged or considered in the debate to date.<\/p><p> The next point I want to jump on to is one about which Mr. O'Leary had expressed concerns in the media a few weeks ago.  I welcome the mandatory face coverings on public transport.  That is important.  It was a welcome decisive move made early in the new Government.  It removed any awkwardness about it so that people, by and large, immediately began to don the face coverings.  I saw not everyone on the Luas and train was doing it.  There is voluntary compliance.  I note Mr. O'Leary expressed concerns about drivers and inspectors being pressed into service, almost as policemen, trying to enforce that.  How is that working out?  I saw it on the Luas one day.  Through no fault of the drivers, it was not working out well.  They were doing their best.  The Luas had to keep stopping and passengers were being ejected and maybe put in their place a little.  The journey was slowed down and it became a little messy.<\/p><p> Jumping along to the details of Mr. O'Leary's submission, I might put all my points across and maybe they can respond in bulk.  It might be the most efficient way.  In the NBRU submission today, Mr. O'Leary talked about a 24-hour society as opposed to a 24-hour transport society, which many cities have.  I often consider, especially when running for the last train home out of Heuston at 11.10 p.m., it would be great if there was another one an hour later but one would probably want one an hour later again and so on.  Perhaps that kind of 24-hour public transport clock is what we need to aspire to.  The NBRU touched on that in its submissions and statements in the past.  Perhaps there is an angle there in terms of the recovery.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Leary mentioned spreading the peak as well.  Irish Rail often talked of this.  The NBRU and Irish Rail both talked about this idea whereby, rather than everybody trying to jump on a train at 7.30 a.m. or 8 a.m. and jumping back on the same train at 5.30 p.m. to get home in the evening, and similarly for bus and Luas, people could begin to examine how they might have staggered or different work patterns.  Perhaps Covid can teach us something there.  Perhaps there are learnings or changes in work practices to be drawn from that.  In terms of the 24-hour economy, probably the NBRU has something that would be of interest to say about that.<\/p><p> Finally, I noted the stakeholder forum.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and others might have touched on that.  There is one question I would ask.  Mr. O'Leary has already explained his vision of how that might work but I would ask, will there be a role for local commuter groups?  The Sallins and Naas Rail User Group is the one I am happy to be involved with.  There is a Drogheda user group as well.  There is probably a Navan user group etc.  They would play a useful role in stakeholder engagement as the users of the service.  They already input in different, and perhaps inconsistent, ways to the system.  Mr. O'Leary might talk about how that might operate.<\/p><p> I will leave it there.  I have put a few questions and there is a few minutes left for the witnesses to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#VV00500","speaker":"1583","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions to be answered in three minutes but I am sure the witnesses will do their best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#WW00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I have full confidence in them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#WW00300","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawless for his remarks and also for his contribution in terms of his observations.  I will try to answer the questions, with the last one first.<\/p> <p>  The stakeholders forum, as far as we are concerned in the NBRU, should include all those groups that have a role to play.  It should not be owned by any one group.  The policy decisions today, as we see it, are made by a group in which we have no role.  Commuter groups should be involved along with other stakeholders.  For example, we are here with our colleagues from the taxi industry.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the 24-hour economy, we observed in our research before we put in our submission that there was a 24-hour commission established in London on the issue of having an economy running right through the night, not only on the entertainment and bar industry which we are all familiar with but where cultural venues could be open and, indeed, the economy itself and retail units could be open.  Of course, there is much stakeholder involvement in that as well and it would need to be discussed.  The programme for Government mentions that.  From that perspective, it is encouraging.<\/p> <p>  In relation to the enforcement issue that Deputy Lawless raised, I made the remark to Deputy Carroll MacNeill earlier that by and large people are complying with the face coverings.  There is a small minority who are not.  There is that issue that is still hanging out there.  I should remind the Deputies that we have been calling for a dedicated Garda public transport division for quite some time now.  We have support from the Garda representative bodies on that and they could have had a role here, had they been resourced properly.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's observations on Irish Rail in getting the trains, we wrote to Irish Rail as recently as last week indicating that we have a problem representing workers on the train services with the capacity issue.  I am at pains to point to my own people as much as anybody else that we will take public health advice on the social distance being reduced, but we will not have a situation where we compromise the health and safety of our members and, indeed, the travelling public.  There is an issue in enforcement of capacity issues.  I suppose, anecdotally, we have a situation where people are travelling in numbers, they all want to travel together and they are inclined to sit in between the carriages, and that is a problem.<\/p><p>The issue relating to school buses will be very complex and will be predicated, we assume, on the decisions when they are made about the return to school.  Bus &Eacute;ireann carries approximately 117,000 children to school each day, which is 41 million journeys each year.  Many of the operators that work for Bus &Eacute;ireann are private indigenous interests, demonstrating clearly that while the unions might be described as anti-private, we do a lot of work with private coaches and they complement the publicly-owned companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#WW00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dermot O'Leary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I would like to come in on Deputy Lawless&rsquo;s point regarding schools.

If the social distancing rule stays at 1 m, 2 m or 50% capacity, it will present significant challenges to carry that number of children each day when the schools return in September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank our guests.  Taxi drivers are suffering.  Many taxis operators in the constituency of Cork South-West and throughout the country have been in contact with me prior to this ten-minute packaging and other things that they feel are not steering their way.  Taxi drivers are suffering extreme stress and anxiety during the Covid-19 pandemic as they have seen their incomes wiped out.  Nonetheless, they have to keep their cars taxed, insured and licensed.  They are fearful of cancelling their insurance as they may find it difficult or impossible to get insurance again or a renewal could see their premiums inflate.<\/p> <p>  Many drivers are over 66 years of age, working full-time and paying income tax but, because of age discrimination, they were unable to avail of the Covid-19 payment.  Significant numbers of drivers have been in the business for 40 years and having paid exorbitant fees for their taxi plates under the old system are still bearing this very significant financial burden.<\/p> <p>  Drivers have recurring costs.  For example, a taxi licence costs &euro;250 for five years plus &euro;125 a year for the vehicle licensing.  Should existing licences be given free to anyone over 66 in some compensation to these people who have paid into the system are being discriminated against at present?  With their vehicles parked up, the licence fee is also very unfair.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the condition of a taxi, it has to be taken off the road in its tenth year.  Drivers have to upgrade their cars in order to keep their licences active.  In the current difficult business climate, cars are predominantly parked up.  In these exceptional times, could the taxi age be increased from ten to 15 years to ease the financial burden?<\/p> <p>  Does the NTA have surplus moneys it collected from taxi drivers over the years?  If so, could these funds be made available to support drivers making car upgrades?  These grants are already available for wheelchair-accessible taxis.

The car test and the suitability test are carried out in the same premises on two different occasions.  We do not understand why they cannot all be done at the same time.  Why do we have to drive away and come back two days later to do the second part of a test?  That is a cost to drivers.  As well as the monetary cost of the tests, it is also a cost in time and effort.<\/p> <p>  GAA and League of Ireland venues throughout the country are starting to open up this weekend.  There is never provision for a taxi rank at these places.  These are the opportunities that taxi drivers are seeking at the moment.  The Government should set in place positions were taxi drivers can pick up an income.  It has been repeatedly missed.

The Bus &Eacute;ireann 115 route in north Kildare was already running over capacity before the pandemic.  I was talking to the group in Kilcock last night.  With not so many people back at work, it is manageable at the moment.  However, we will need further capacity on these routes.  While every route suffers during rush hour, some routes need particular attention.  Is enough being done in this regard, especially with more people on the move and with the numbers relating to Covid rising again?<\/p> <p>  In the context of train capacity, could Irish Rail limit the number of tickets being sold to customers so that it would be easier for those customers to adhere to social distancing requirements?

I am well able to make the arguments in the media but the stakeholders' forum is where the business should be done.<\/p> <p>  On capacity generally, the country is very good at planning in the middle of a boom and trying to implement during recessions and we fail all the time.  This is an opportunity to do the opposite.  Irish Rail is a case in point.  It is only last autumn where \"Prime Time\" broadcast an expos&eacute;, as it were, where more than 40 train carriages known as 2700s were mothballed because the NTA paymasters said they were too expensive to refurbish.  Had they been in service, they would have helped and would continue to help with capacity issues.  There has been severe underinvestment in rail.<\/p> <p>  The 115 route in Kildare is also an issue of capacity.  Two types of people know about this, day in, day out, namely, the bus drivers and the people who use the service, but it takes a long time for the information to get up to the decision makers.

Our submission notes the fear that people will move away from public transport to cars.  Our submission referred to an Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service report commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2017 put the cost of congestion in the greater Dublin area alone at &euro;358 million.  We cannot go back.  The Covid crisis demonstrated what is possible when there are empty streets.  To be fair to Owen Keegan in Dublin City Council, whom I am not a fan of and he knows that, there was a move towards pedestrian and cycleways during the crisis.  Investment will have to be at the fore to bring in extra capacity in buses.<\/p><p>Buses can be purchased much quicker than rail coaches.  Capacity is what is required.<\/p><p> As I said to Deputy Lawless, we need to elongate the peak travel period.  Some 46% of journeys are made at peak times, and that peak has to be elongated.  We wrote to the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and other party leaders suggesting that school and college opening times and retail be staggered.  We also made that point in our submission.  That was partially done in the second phase when some retail units did not open until 10.30 a.m.  That is the type of thinking that is needed.  As I keep repeating, stakeholder involvement is vital.  There is no point in dictating down the chain because that begets a reaction which is usually negative.

Before other speakers contribute again, I will ask one more question.  Mr. Waldron said that he received 500 boxes of face masks from the Chinese embassy.  I do not expect him to be able to answer this question, but does he have any idea where they were made?  I ask that question because in the People's Republic of China there is a phenomenon called a labour transfer programme.  The Chinese Government describes it as a programme whereby local residents rise above poverty through employment and lead fulfilling lives.  However, it has been reported in <i>The New York Times<\/i>, a relatively reputable newspaper, that penalties faced by those who refuse to co-operate often mean that their participation is in effect involuntary and that this could amount under international law to forced labour.  There has been a certain focus on the Xinjiang province in the north west of China, an area that I visited in a very different capacity almost 20 years ago.  There is a minority there called Uighurs, which is largely a Muslim ethnic minority.  Under this labour transfer programme, Uighurs are often sent into factory and service jobs.  According to the National Medical Products Administration of China, only four companies in Xinjiang produced medical grade protective equipment before the pandemic but, as of 20 June, that number had increased to 51.<\/p><p>From a review of state media reports and public records, <i>The New York Times<\/i>found that at least 17 of those companies participate in the labour transfer programme.  While those companies produce equipment primarily for domestic use, <i>The New York Times <\/i>also identified other companies outside Xinjiang which were using Uighur labour and were exporting globally, including to the United States.  There has been a huge jump in the number of face masks being worn, which is to be welcomed generally, but would it be of concern to the witnesses if some of those face masks were being produced using forced labour?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#BBB00800","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I am not aware of where they came from.

He was not allowed to change his policy for the period but was only allowed to defer the payment, which he did for three months.  His policy is up for renewal in August and he was told that unless he pays the three months straight up, the company would not quote him.  This is a company he has been with for ten years.  He was willing to offer a deal of paying that three-month figure over ten months which I think is fair enough.

He has seven days now to reinstate his licence.  He said he does not want to go back to work at the moment and would rather stay off for another couple of months for health reasons.  He has been told he cannot extend his suspension.  What does that mean practically?  It means he now must install or replace full taxi insurance which could probably cost him &euro;200 per month, or more, on what he is already paying now because the NTA will not allow him to continue his suspension.  The NTA has not negotiated prices on behalf of taxi drivers and has not negotiated at all with insurance companies to allow drivers to step down.  The simplest thing for it to do is to say to all drivers that if they want to step their insurance down to a social and domestic policy for three months, we could all save money.  However, it would not allow us because the regulation states if one has a taxi one must have full taxi insurance at all times.

I ask the witnesses to outline what models have been assessed for our ports and airports in that regard.

As regards what we have in place, we have the passenger locator form, which will move to an electronic form very soon, and follow-up questioning from colleagues in the border management unit.  We acknowledge that has not been as effective as we would like it to be, which is why we are setting up a call centre that will follow up on all the passenger locator forms completed by people who come into the country.  We are moving to an electronic version of the form, which the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is developing as we speak.  Although travel into the country is significantly reduced by normal standards, that should enable us to follow up with people in a much more rigorous and robust way.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the self-declaratory nature of the protocols, when we started to reopen society and the economy, we introduced the roadmap for reopening.  Like many of the approaches we have taken to dealing with Covid, that has been based on engaging with people, explaining things to them and encouraging them to abide by the public health guidance, advice, regulations and instructions that have been put in place by the Government.  That has worked very well across a number of areas and we believe the self-declaratory approach is working quite well when it comes to air and marine travel.  As we understand it, the incidence of contagion is zero on the marine side.  We have no evidence of any case having been contracted during travel into the country.  Similarly, we have not been alerted to the protocols not working when it comes to air travel.<\/p> <p>  As regards there not being checks, controls or diagnostics by third parties, we try to engage, explain and encourage people, and we seek to steer clear from enforcement, as best we can, unless it absolutely needs to be done.  Mr. Towey may want to add something on temperature screening and DNA testing.  We believe more could be done.

Our colleagues have looked at these possibilities, not only terminal screening, that is, temperature controls, but also other tests for the virus that might be conducted at either the point of departure or the point of arrival.  While it is entirely understandable that people believe that if it were possible to have a conclusive test on arrival, that would be a measure we could take to improve safety, in fact the public health advice is that the type of testing available does not provide that level of assurance.  The view of public health experts is that the case for introducing measures of that kind is quite marginal.  One of the difficulties is that tests can produce false negative results, and they then create a false sense of security and increase the risk of virus transmission.

The answer to the second questions is \"Yes\".  We are moving to put the passenger locator form onto an electronic footing and, as I mentioned earlier, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is developing that as we speak.  Once we have that done, we will be far better able to identify and authenticate the people filling out the passenger locator forms.  That will be really important for us in terms of the follow-up and a much more effective and robust way to follow up.  We will do that by way of increasing the capacity we have working on this at the moment.  It is the case that we do not have enough capacity on that, and that is well recognised and accepted.  For that reason we are working with a third party with a view to standing up a call centre at least by 10 August, but we hope before then.  Those are the things we are doing at the moment and which we need to do better.<\/p> <p>  As for other things we could do, my colleague, Mr. Towey, mentioned earlier that we were giving consideration to departure point testing.  We are exploring that and will make a decision on it fairly soon.  In addition, we would like to increase the soft pressure at the point of departure, whereby airlines at time of booking and at time of departure would ensure that people coming in from countries not on the green list would be made aware of the need for them to restrict their movements when they arrive.<\/p><p>Potentially, we could also do some entry screening at Dublin Airport and step up the testing we are doing there at the moment.  We do have processes in place whereby somebody who is symptomatic can be and is being tested.  We have random testing under way, and the level to which we would step that up is being considered as well.  The things we are doing we need to do better.  We also need to do more things to try to make sure we prevent the virus from being imported.

The approach we have taken with the green list is the start.  The green list will be reviewed every two weeks.  We have the first green list and we will have our second iteration of it in a couple of weeks.  We needed to start somewhere and now, thankfully, we have a start.

Last week in the media I requested that we do Polymerase chain reaction, PCR, Covid testing at Dublin and the other airports.  I believe this is eminently feasible and have made the point that if we do not do it at the airports, we will end up doing it in the community a little bit later in the year.  I note the comments made by a previous speaker who I think said that the medical advice was that the testing regime was not robust enough or did not capture enough and therefore it was almost not worth doing.  PCR Covid testing is what we do in the hospitals at present and is about 80% to 85% effective.  I am not sure there is any test anywhere more effective than that.  Essentially, we decide when we test that we are going to miss people who are asymptomatic at the time or are very early on in the infection because it does do not show up then.  A subsequent test, if they have symptoms, is we how establish that they are Covid-positive.  Then we go through the rigmarole of contact tracing and all the rest of it.  I heard what Mr. Spratt said about testing at airports and foreign centres.  Has anyone looked at the cost of doing what we are proposing to do abroad which we could probably do now quite easily here?  We certainly know the costs of doing it here.  I am not sure that we know what we are going to pay for doing it abroad.  We will still have the same number of cases slipping through regardless of where we do it.  Perhaps someone will take that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#ZZZ00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I might make some remarks and then see if Mr. Towey has anything he wishes to add.<\/p> <p>  The benefit of departure testing is that the person would be required to take the test himself or herself 24 to 72 hours before actually departing.  That result would be presented to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, on arrival at Dublin Airport.  The person would not travel if he or she had received a positive test result.  The benefit of that would be that that person would not have actually travelled and potentially come into close contact with all of the other travellers.  Therefore, we would avoid a situation where if we had entry testing and someone tested positive, we would have to do all of the required follow-up with the other travellers, so there is that benefit.  There is also the benefit of the cost being borne by the traveller.  There is also the issue of capacity.  The capacity for testing on arrival does not arise if one has departure testing.  That is why we are looking at that as closely as we are.  There is the potential to do not only a high-street test where a person purchases his or her own test but we could improve the standardisation of that through colleagues in the Department of Health, NPHET and the HPSC.  As such we would set the bar relatively high and apply that to departure points.  Again, that would reduce issues of capacity, credibility and cost.

Effectively, that is what is being addressed by the diagnostic test kits to which reference has been made.  That is essentially how they work.  Unless, of course, the Department has another one I do not know about, which it may have.  I am not an expert but I know a little bit about it.  Having said that, the most important thing the Department needs to flag is whether this is what is being proposed, and, if so, that it is proposed and gets done because we need to take action in respect of foreign travel, particularly from the US, South America and other places that are not on the green list.<\/p><p> We heard from the aviation sector this morning.  It has more or less been established that it is assumed people getting on flights do not have Covid but for those who are asymptomatic, the transmission rate appears to be very low because of the negative air pressure in the cabin, recirculation and the high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters.  We can assume that we are saying it is safe for people to be beside each other for six hours wearing masks.<\/p><p> The question then is why we are not doing this for the taxi sector.  Why are we not making masks mandatory?  I heard a previous contributor state that taxi drivers can ask people to put on masks.  I remind the committee that a couple of weeks ago a bus driver was kicked to death in France by two people full of alcohol because he asked them to wear masks getting on a bus.  It is not operationally possible for many people going back out to drive taxis, particularly those earning very little money, to start asking customers to wear masks.  The first thing a customer might say is that he or she does not have one.  In such circumstances, taxi drivers will have to supply masks at their own expense.  Even then, customers may not wear them.  It would be far better if the Department took a leadership role on this matter.  The witnesses will say that the medical advisers, NPHET and everybody else have not come to them and stated that it is a good idea.  We need to look at what is going on in other countries.  Those responsible for providing leadership within the Department are in a position to make a strong recommendation to the effect that the wearing of masks in taxis should be mandatory.  Is this a reasonable assertion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#ZZZ00700","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Before we go on to wearing masks in taxis, it is important to note that we are learning as we go.

If somebody were to test positive at departure point and then decide to hell with this, travel anyway and put people in danger, it would be a pretty serious decision for that person to take.  It would be contrary to what we have seen with regard to almost universal compliance with requests for people to be in this together.

These are simple measures that would give confidence to the public and employers, would show the country we are trying to mitigate the disease and would not make simple solutions difficult to implement.  The witnesses can come back to me in writing on the screens for the taxis.<\/p><p> I have received correspondence from a person with a limo business who works at weddings.  The gentleman says his vehicles must pass an NCT every six months and the cars are then booked in for a suitability test, which is an inspection to grant the licence.  He pays every six months for the service and licence.  This gentleman paid over the phone for a suitability test, which was then cancelled due to the lockdown.  He was refunded for the booking but during the lockdown he had also paid for the NCT for a number of cars, which have been idle for a number of months.  When he tried to book again he was informed that he has seven days in which to complete the booking and, if not, the NCT for the cars will have to be done again.  He has received no reimbursement for the NCTs and is now expected to carry out 13 NCTs in the next seven days or face a &euro;500 fine per car.<\/p><p> Can we please address this type of nonsense and lack of joined-up thinking?  People in business are at their wits' end.  Various Departments dealing with Government regulation do not speak to each other and small business people are being hammered time and again.  They cannot get into business and when they are in business all they have is one regulation to meet after another.  I implore the Department.<\/p><p> There is also an issue with driving tests.  I know of a young lady who has graduated college.  She has been offered a fantastic job, one of only three in the country, and needs a full driver's licence to get the job but she cannot get a test.  She has been told by this multinational company that if she does not have a full driver's licence by September, it cannot offer her the job because it is a contract of employment.  I am running around trying to see how we can get her a driving test.  We are told there is no safe way for a driving test to be completed.  Dual-driving cars could have a screen placed in them and we could certainly get emergency driving tests done.

We are elected by our constituencies to do that and to be here.  I know this is a difficult time but we cannot be in two places at the same time.<\/p> <p>  I thank our guests for being here today.  As I said earlier, taxi drivers are suffering extreme stress.  Taxi drivers and private bus operators are going through a difficult and anxious time during the Covid-19 crisis as their incomes have dropped and some taxi drivers have been wiped out.  Nonetheless, they must keep their cars taxed, insured and licensed.  They are fearful of cancelling their insurance because they may find it difficult or impossible to get insurance in the future and a renewal of their policies could see inflated premiums.<\/p> <p>  Many drivers are over 66 years of age, working full time and paying income tax but, because of age discrimination, are unable to avail of the Covid-19 payment.  Significant numbers of drivers have been in the business for 40 years and, having paid exorbitant fees for their taxi plates under the old system, are still bearing this financial burden.  They face repeated costs, such as the cost of a taxi licence, which amounts to &euro;250 for five years, and &euro;125 per year for a vehicle licence.  Can existing licence holders who are over 66 years of age be given some incentive?  Perhaps licences should be made free to drivers over the age of 66.<\/p> <p>  Regardless of the condition of a taxi, it must be taken off the road once it is ten years old.  Drivers have to upgrade their cars to keep a licence active and, in the current business climate in these difficult times, their cars are predominantly parked up.  In these exceptional circumstances, could that ten-year limit be increased to 15 years to ease the financial stress on drivers?<\/p> <p>  Does the National Transport Authority, NTA, have surplus moneys that have been collected from taxi drivers over the years?  If so, could those funds be made available to support drivers with car upgrades?  These grants are already available for wheelchair taxis.  Taxi drivers need support now.<\/p> <p>  Was there anything for taxi operators or private, independent bus operators announced in the stimulus package?  I asked that question in our first session this morning and the union representatives said that they did not see anything in the stimulus package.  Many operators are going out of business and I am worried that there was nothing in the stimulus package for them.  Our guests might be able to answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#CCCC00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1595545200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I will take those questions.  To answer the question the Deputy asked about initiatives for the private sector, he may be aware that, on 25 June, the Government made a decision to introduce a new system of temporary funding supports for the commercial bus sector.  These are operators that typically provide scheduled bus services but are not a part of the public service obligation, PSO, regime because, in normal circumstances, they make a profit from their business.  However, at the moment, because passenger numbers have been hit so hard by the Covid-19 emergency, those operators are not in a position to make profits.  The Deputy has described the situation correctly.  Those operators have high costs but need to keep services running.  In this case, we are talking about services where there is a strong public interest for the services to keep running because they are providing a facility that the travelling public needs, particularly people who are either essential workers or others making necessary journeys.  To that end, the Government made a decision that, on an exceptional basis for a period of six months, it would introduce a new temporary funding support arrangement.  That is being done within the provisions of EU and Irish law and being administered by the NTA.  It is putting contract arrangements in place with relevant private sector and other commercial operators where it judges that the services that those operators provide have a public service justification for their continuation.  That is significant.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the stimulus package.  I understand that an initiative has been announced as part of the stimulus package specifically for coach tourism.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is progressing that initiative.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the age of vehicles used as taxis and licence fees for taxi drivers.<\/p><p>He might be aware that those matters come within the ambit of the NTA.  Under legislation passed by the Houses in 2013, the NTA is the regulator for the taxi sector.  It has statutory independence from the Department and we do not have a role in areas in respect of which it makes decisions.  The two issues about which the Deputy asked come within the remit of the NTA.<\/p><p> The Deputy might be aware, from the comments we made earlier, that within the past week or so the taxi advisory committee has made a report to the Minister and the Department.  The previous Minister met representatives of the advisory committee a number of weeks ago and encouraged them to come up with a report after looking at what needs to be done across the sector.  The advisory committee has come up with a list of measures that it thinks are relevant.  Some of those measures are relevant to the Department, some to the NTA and others to a few other Departments.  There will be an engagement next week between the Department, the NTA and the taxi advisory committee to give preliminary feedback on the proposals that have been put forward.  Some of the proposals will be possible to be implement and others will not.  A few, indeed, are already in train.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about grants specifically for the taxi industry.  There are no initiatives under way in that regard but, within the stimulus package and more generally in the horizontal business supports that have been introduced by the Government in recent weeks and months, a number of initiatives are relevant.  The pandemic unemployment payment is relevant to those who are not currently working and have temporarily ceased working in the sector because of the emergency.  As was announced yesterday, that payment will continue for a considerable period.<\/p><p> Specifically considering a business focus and helping people with their business costs, restart and enterprise support grants are available.  There are also credit guarantee schemes available for businesses that need to undertake loans.  Advisory supports are also available.  They do not get as much coverage as other supports but can be very helpful to small businesses such as taxi companies and others.  Those supports offer advice on matters such as financial planning, business continuity and how to get going and cope with business challenges.<\/p><p> There is no way we are underestimating the business challenges because they are real.  They affect the taxi sector as they do practically all other sectors of business.  The motivation to be of assistance and help business as best possible is what is underlying Government policy on things such as the stimulus package and the range of horizontal supports that have been announced.  I hope I have captured the main points that the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020072400002#CCCC00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hanlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1595545200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Ms Hanlon absolutely has.  The impact of Covid-19 on the finances of coach tour operators has been disastrous.  Such operators traditionally plan their finances on the basis that they need to cover their operating costs throughout the winter period until the tourist season commences the following March.  The timing of the outbreak of Covid-19 has meant that many of those operators have no reserves left to enable them to survive the crisis until the revenue, we hope, starts to flow again in the 2021 tourist season.  What financial support mechanism should be put in place, considering that the turnover for the coach tourism and private hire industry is &euro;250 million per year and that fixed costs amount to 17% of this amount?  The latter highlights a need for a yearly subsidy requirement of &euro;42.5 million.

Is it being looked at as an alternative to isolation on arrival in Ireland or in addition to isolation in Ireland?  Is it envisaged that it would apply only to incoming passengers, that is, non-Irish residents, looking to come to Ireland or would it equally apply to Irish residents who have gone abroad and are seeking to return to Ireland?  If it does, will it even extend as far as people who have gone abroad temporarily for a holiday who are looking to return?  They are my three questions on departure-point testing.

I believe there is an anomaly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the coach service in Northern Ireland, which does tours around Ireland.  We are very grateful for that, but there is a substantial difference in VAT between Irish coach tourism and private bus operators compared to those in the North of Ireland.  Perhaps that is something the Department could look at in terms of competition given the significant advantage to operators based in the North.<\/p><p>There are no open windows on buses any more so they require air to be recirculated through the air conditioning system.  Some newer buses may have the ability to easily put on HEPA filters but it is a more involved job for older buses, as it requires a modification of the existing air circulation system.  Perhaps that is something the Department needs to examine in terms of passenger safety.<\/p><p>The cost of adding a HEPA filter is not too expensive, between &euro;700 and &euro;900, but it is probably a lot more to put the filters into older buses.  Such an initiative should be considered.
