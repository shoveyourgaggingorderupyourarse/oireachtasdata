It is, however, based on the proposition that an investigation must, necessarily, relate to an individual rather than to conduct which falls below acceptable standards.  For the sake of clarity, let me say that if a member, or indeed, former member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is accused of a criminal offence, then it is of no consequence whether that person is, or was or remains a member while the criminal investigation is on-going.  The position may be different if the investigation is one of a non-criminal nature and for which the ultimate sanction may be some form of disciplinary process.  Clearly a former member cannot be subject to disciplinary sanction.<\/p>  <p>  I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy can see the difficulty which will arise if a member seeks to retire from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is sought to prevent him or her doing so, even where an investigation of a disciplinary nature into his or her conduct is underway.<\/p>  <p>  But let me say that it is a matter to which my Department will be giving consideration in the context of new legislation which will arise in the implementation of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing.  One possible option is to provide in law, as has been done in the UK, that a member remains subject to some form of sanction for a period after retirement in respect of a finding of a breach of discipline for actions which occurred prior to his or her retirement.   <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in early 2017 the Government approved the drafting of the heads of a Bill to address a number of operational issues that had been brought to the attention of my predecessor by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission - GSOC.<\/p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was established and its remit involved reviewing the police oversight architecture including how complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are handled.  <\/p>  <p>  GSOC prepared a case for fundamental reform of the legislation relating to its structure and operation.  One of the matters covered in GSOC's proposals was one which would make it possible to delay the retirement of a member who is under investigation.  Given its remit, I referred these proposals to the Commission as an input to its work and I am aware that GSOC engaged with the Commission in its own right. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland published its report on 18 September.  One of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations is that GSOC&rsquo;s existing mandate to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour against members who have retired or resigned should be continued under any new complaints body.  It also recommended that the investigation of incidents relating to former staff which do not involve alleged criminal behaviour should also be addressed in its remit. It is worth emphasising that the report stated that the complaints body should investigate incidents rather than individuals.  The Government noted this Report on publication and my Department has consulted widely on the issues raised including with GSOC and with the Garda Commissioner in advance of my returning to Government in December with a high level implementation plan.<\/p>  <p>  That high level plan is being prepared at the moment, taking into account the Commission Report itself and the observations of interested parties, including GSOC.  Without wishing to pre-empt the Government's consideration of the Report in December, I can say that the proposals in relation to GSOC are ones that I broadly support, though the detail will have to be teased out in the drafting of legislation to give them effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA01500"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[49665\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources for policing operations over the Christmas period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1300","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I want to clarify that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of the very substantial resources that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives.

The allocation of Garda resources is solely a matter for the Commissioner, in the light of identified operational demands over the festive season and is not a matter for which I, as Minister, have direct responsibility.<\/p><p>The resources available to the Commissioner have reached unprecedented levels. I am pleased that Budget 2019 provides for the continuation of this increase in resources with an increase of &euro;110 million in the Garda Vote to bring total provision available in 2019 to &euro;1.76 billion which includes up to &euro;95 million for the payment of overtime.<\/p><p>Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities including the need ensure community safety and the safety of our roads over the festive season, when there can be seasonal increases in burglary, public order and road traffic incidents and offences.

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Thor has led to concentrated Garda activity resulting, as of 18 November 2018, in over 168,636 targeted checkpoints and 234,277 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This concentrated policing activity against burglary and property-related crime has produced in the region of 8,837 arrests and 10,143 charges covering a range of offences, which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.<\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

As Minister, I am very regularly engaged on this case. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  I do not share the Deputy's implied criticism of GSOC or its report into the tragic case that is the subject of her question.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government's position on GSOC is very clear; the Commission has our full support and we are providing it with the necessary resources to perform its important functions. It is incumbent upon this House to respect GSOC's independence, as it is this guarantee of independence which is the hallmark of effective oversight. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a current investigation being conducted by GSOC into conduct which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more Garda members. That investigation is on-going and I do not propose to comment further at this time.  I respect GSOC's independence and it would be entirely inappropriate of me to comment in relation to a continuing investigation.<\/p>  <p>  I can say that I have been informed by GSOC that the outcome of that investigation will be submitted to the GSOC Commissioners as soon as is practicable.  Upon receipt of the report, GSOC will, in accordance with section 97 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, submit a report to the Garda Commissioner outlining its findings.  This report will also contain a recommendation as to whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Disciplinary Regulations against any of the Garda members subject of the investigation.<\/p>  <p>  As I have made clear to the House, both in response to the motion calling for an inquiry and subsequently in response to various Parliamentary Questions, it is imperative that the independence of the Ombudsman Commission be respected and a decision on any further action be deferred until the current investigation is completed.  I reiterate the point that the question of what further action might be taken will be fully considered by Government as soon as the GSOC investigation is completed.<\/p>  <p>  I am very mindful of the D&aacute;il resolution passed earlier this year seeking to have a public inquiry to examine the circumstances leading to the death of a young man. In the course of the debate, I made it clear that both I and the Government recognise the failings that occurred in the period leading up to the fatal road traffic incident.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth mentioning that the D&aacute;il motion also referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the courts. I do not need to point out again the statutory or constitutional independence of the DPP, the Courts and GSOC. <\/p>  <p>  Having said that, I am anxious to see how I can progress matters, even while the GSOC investigation continues.  Any further investigation, if it is to happen, must be focused on those questions to which answers have not been provided to date, rather than rehearsing what is already known about this tragic case.  <\/p>  <p>  To that end, I have written to the Attorney General seeking his advice on how I can best give effect to the wishes of the House.  Upon receipt of a response from the Attorney General, I will be in a position to outline how I propose to proceed. In the meantime, it is important that GSOC be given the necessary time and space to complete the investigations free from hindrance and encumbrance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Surveillance Operations","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA02100"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[49714\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason the Garda have not been asked to examine allegations of unauthorised surveillance being carried out on prison staff and solicitors, including the placing of traffic devices on cars.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>The details of the allegations which were published last week in the Irish Examiner are contained in an affidavit to the Court by a prison officer in relation to a personnel issue.

A further &euro;60 million exchequer funding underpins the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme, which is a 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities benefiting over 30 locations around the country. This is in addition to the investment of approximately &euro;100 million in development of 3 major new Divisional and Regional Headquarters which have been completed and entered into operation use in 2017 and 2018 at Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street, Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  This significant current and capital investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage the resources at his disposal and to determine the allocation of resources across all Divisions, including Cavan\/ Monaghan Division, in light of operational requirements.

As Minister, I am very regularly engaged on this case. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission conducted an investigation into certain matters related to the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Shane O'Farrell.  This investigation arose out of a series of complaints to GSOC from members of the family of Shane O'Farrell.  Certain aspects of the case were also referred to GSOC for investigation by a previous Minister.<\/p>  <p>  Both I and the Government have indicated that we recognise the failings that occurred in the run up to this tragic incident.  <\/p>  <p>  The outcome of GSOC&rsquo;s investigation was set out in a report earlier this year, which was provided to the family of Shane O'Farrell.  The investigation concluded that no criminal misbehaviour by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was disclosed.  GSOC&rsquo;s investigation found that, while no such conduct occurred which would require criminal sanction, certain aspects were identified as requiring further investigation which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more members.  The investigation of those matters by GSOC is still on-going.  In the circumstances I do not propose to comment further while the investigation is proceeding.<\/p>  <p>  I can say that I have been informed by GSOC that the outcome of that investigation will be submitted to the GSOC Commissioners as soon as is practicable.  Upon receipt of the report, GSOC will, in accordance with section 97 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, submit a report to the Garda Commissioner outlining its findings.  It will also contain a recommendation about whether or not disciplinary proceedings should be instituted under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Disciplinary Regulations against any of the Garda members subject of the investigation.<\/p>  <p>  While the Deputy's Question refers to the motion passed by the House in June this year, I have previously made clear to the House that it is imperative that the independence of the Ombudsman Commission is respected and that there is no improper interference with its investigations.<\/p>  <p>  The motion referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the Courts.  I would remind the Deputy of the constitutional independence of the Courts and the statutory independence of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions and GSOC.  These are important matters which must be taken into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I have been considering the motion passed by the D&aacute;il and I have written to the Attorney General seeking his advice on how I can best give effect to the wishes of the House.  When I have received the Attorney's response, I will be in a position to outline how I propose to proceed. <\/p>  <p>  We are all aware of the significant amount of time that the GSOC investigation has taken. I am cognisant of the effect that this must be having on the family.  I want to pay tribute to the family for their determination in pursuing the matter.  There are clearly lessons to be learned from this tragedy and I am committed to doing all that is possible to ensure that the failings identified are not repeated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal Funding","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA03700"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[49586\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to increase funding in 2019 to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal to allow it settle and reduce the backlog of cases that has built up in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the level of resources allocated for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, as for any area of the Justice Vote, must be determined having regard to the overall budgetary context and the many demands for funding within the sector.

This deals with, inter alia, the issue of provision for mentally ill prisoners. <\/p><p>Before detailing below the services that are available in this respect, I would firstly say that the views of the IPRT are welcome. The provision of appropriate mental health services to those in custody is one of the major challenges to effective healthcare in prisons. Prisons form part of society and those in custody must not be discriminated against in terms of their mental health. <\/p><p>To address this issue, an Interdepartmental Group, involving representatives from the relevant Government bodies, has been established to examine issues relating to people with mental illness who come in contact with the criminal justice system  Its first interim report was published in September 2016. That deals with how diversion could be facilitated, where appropriate, at all stages of the criminal process up to the conclusion of a criminal trial. <\/p><p>The second report of the Interdepartmental Group explores matters relating to mental health services for prisoners and persons subject to community sanctions, matters relating to patients detained under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 and post-release mental health services for former prisoners. This report is currently being finalised and will be published on completion. Upon publication of the second report, the work of the Interdepartmental Group will be complete and the implementation of their recommendations will then be considered. <\/p><p>In addition, a general review of healthcare in the prisons is being carried out by a Working Group involving officials from my Department, the Department of Health and the HSE. This flows from a report in 2016, from the then Inspector of Prisons on Healthcare in the Irish Prison Service.<\/p><p>Currently, a range of mental health services are available to prisoners, in collaboration with the Health Service Executive (HSE) and involving the National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS).<\/p><p>In-reach mental health services involving the provision of weekly forensic mental health sessions are available in the Dublin and Portlaoise prisons. The HSE also provides specialist in-reach, psychiatric services to those in custody in Limerick and Cork prisons. <\/p><p>The Irish Prison Service has access to a limited number of places in the Central Mental Hospital for prisoners who require residential mental health treatment. There is currently an average of 25 prisoners each week awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital, and the NFMHS has acknowledged the challenge of access for prisoners to in-patient treatment beds.  It is anticipated that the opening of the new Central Mental Hospital in 2020 will help address capacity issues for prisoners in need of in-patient treatment.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed that approval has been granted for the appointment of a consultant-led team to Castlerea, Limerick, and Cork prisons. The HSE has also advised that difficulties have been encountered in recruiting a consultant psychiatrist for Castlerea Prison. <\/p><p>The NFMHS also provides an assessment and liaison service for all other prisons where a prisoner requires a forensic assessment, or access to an admission bed in the Central Mental Hospital. Consultant Forensic Psychiatrists are leading these services and can be supported by Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors, Community Psychiatric Nurses, and Social Workers.<\/p><p>Two dedicated areas have been established for the provision of high support to vulnerable prisoners with mental illness; D2 wing in Cloverhill Prison (for remand prisoners), and the High Support Unit in Mountjoy (for sentenced prisoners).  Both units provide a dedicated area within the prison where mentally ill and vulnerable prisoners, who present with a risk of harm to self or to others, can be separated from the general prison population and closely monitored in a safer environment. <\/p><p>A psychiatric in-reach and Court Liaison Service is available at Cloverhill Prison. The diversion service ensures, as far as possible, that those people presenting before the courts, or indeed at an earlier stage of the criminal justice system where the infraction is a reflection of an underlying mental illness, are referred and treated appropriately. This approach has reduced the number of mentally ill people committed to prison. <\/p><p>The IPS Psychology Service plays a key role in the provision of mental health services for people in custody.  In conjunction with the multi-disciplinary team the Psychology Service provides various evidence-based primary, secondary and tertiary care talking therapies for people in custody who experience mental health difficulties. <\/p><p>The Irish Prison Service is in the process of further developing the Psychology Service in order to better meet the mental health needs of those in custody.  <\/p><p>The Irish Prison Service has also developed a bespoke mental health training programme for staff, which is currently being delivered to all staff. In addition, all persons in custody in closed prisons have access to the Samaritans Listeners Scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Closed-Circuit Television Systems","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[49791\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of CCTV schemes that have been approved for funding since the scheme commenced; if all local authorities are now signed up to the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[49583\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress made to date to resolve the issues regarding data control and storage for community CCTV schemes.","asker":"1232","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":50,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[49716\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900068#WRA04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will discuss the most recent developments in relation to community CCTV schemes.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":51,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 31 and 50 together.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access, such as town centres, fall into two distinct but complementary categories, namely Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems. Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.<\/p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-<\/p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment. The legal requirement for local authorities to act as data controller for the purpose of community CCTV schemes has been in place since 2006. <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that under the 2005 Act, as amended, the relevant secondary legislation is not a matter for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Rather, the power to establish the criteria for community CCTV schemes is a matter for the Policing Authority, by order made with the approval of the Government. <\/p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns on the legislative basis for CCTV. However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV. We expect findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities.My Department is also engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.<\/p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved for grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.<\/p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme.

This represents an occupancy level of 92%.  I can also advise the Deputy that according to the most recent snapshot of the prison population taken on 31 October 2018, there has been a total of 6,612 committals since 1 January 2018. <\/p>  <p>  It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service does not have the option of refusing committals and must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts. The prison system is, of course, subject to peaks and troughs.  Numbers are particularly high when the Courts are at their busiest, giving rise to a high number of committals. As a result, almost all of the closed institutions are operating at or near full capacity. The Irish Prison Service regularly approves transfers out of affected prisons to other locations in order to prevent unacceptable occupancy levels.<\/p>  <p>  Alternatives to custody continue to be pursued and legislation has already been passed. This includes the Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Act 2011 which requires a sentencing judge to consider the imposition of community service where a custodial sentence of 12 months or less is being considered. The Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 provides that the Court imposing a fine shall take into account a person's financial circumstances. It further provides, inter alia, that where a person fails to pay a fine by the due date, the Court may make an attachment order to earnings as a means of recovering the unpaid fine. As a result of this legislation, we are seeing a reduction in the number of committals to prisons on short sentences. Further, since its inception in 2011, 2,250 prisoners have been released early from prison to take part in the Community Return Scheme and 2,325 prisoners have been released to take part in the Community Support Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I regret the reversal of the trend towards lower prisoner numbers, however, the Deputy will appreciate that I must be respectful of the independence of the judiciary and their total discretion in deciding whether or not to imprison persons appearing before the Courts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Orders","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[49717\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the legislation that governs the regulation of bailiffs, or those acting on behalf of a bailiff or the courts.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, Sheriffs (or County Registrars acting as Sheriffs) are responsible to the Court for the enforcement of Court Orders.

These prosecutions have included the offences of manufacturing, advertising and supply without prescription to individuals and for wholesale supply.

The Inspector of Prisons will therefore have full access to relevant documentation and personnel in Prison Service Headquarters or elsewhere in the Prison Service in her investigation.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also examining the allegations and I understand they will coordinate, if needed, with the Inspector in relation to her investigation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04000"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[49812\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which adequate resources continue to be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at organisational level and technical level to enhance its ability to tackle organised crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I want to clarify that it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the allocation of the very substantial resources that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives. The allocation of Garda resources are a matter for the Commissioner, in light of his identified operational demands. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities. <\/p>  <p>  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies to target, dismantle and disrupt organised criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. It is important to note that Garda&iacute;, supported by the significant resources allocated to it by this Government, have made important progress in tackling the insidious threat of organised crime. The resources available to the Commissioner have reached unprecedented levels, I am pleased that Budget 2019 provides for the continuation of this increase in resources with an increase of &euro;110 million in the Garda Vote to bring total provision available in 2019 to &euro;1.76 billion which includes up to &euro;95 million for the payment of overtime.<\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau was established as a national multi-disciplinary agency specialising in the targeting of proceeds of crime. The Bureau draws together the necessary expertise from a number of Departments and agencies. The Bureau has for some considerable time maintained a presence in each of the Garda Divisions through the operation of the Divisional Assets Profiler Programme. Under this Programme asset profilers are providing a criminal asset profiling service across the Garda Divisions in relation to persons or suspects operating within the area, with particular reference to those involved in serious and organised crime. The Bureau utilises the local knowledge supplied to it by the asset profilers which allows the Bureau to target the proceeds of crime in local communities. I can inform the Deputy that a number of legislative measures have been introduced to tackle gang-related and associated crime including the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional powers for Garda&iacute;; in particular, powers to allow for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I look forward to attending the attestation of another 200 recruits tomorrow which will see Garda numbers reach 14,000 by the end of this year.  This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide significant additional policing hours throughout the country, both in terms of the increase in new Garda&iacute; and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing duties due to civilianisation of their current roles. These new resources coming on stream has allowed the Commissioner to allocate additional resources to the specialist bureaus that comprise Garda Special Crime Operations including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda capital allocation has increased from &euro;61 million to &euro;92 million in 2019, a 50% increase. This will facilitate investment of around &euro;65 million in ICT which is now an important element of the fight against organised crime.  This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in their daily work in tackling the scourge of organised crime in our communities.  <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I remain in close contact with the Commissioner to ensure that the necessary resources are available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to robustly confront and tackle those involved in organised criminal activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Seeker Employment","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04300"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[49792\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of asylum seekers that have been granted the right to work since June 2018; his views on the fact that the limitations imposed are stopping asylum seekers from obtaining work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>The European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2018, which I signed into effect from 30 June 2018, includes access to the labour market for qualified international protection applicants.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides confirmation in writing to any qualified applicant of their entitlement to access the labour market, for use when they apply for a job or become self employed. It is a free, easy to use, accessible service with a very short turn around from receipt of application to the sending out of the workplace permission. It is a very broad access to the workplace. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that since the introduction of the Regulations, 2,521 international protection applicants have applied for a permission to access the labour market of which 1,743 were granted a permission and 739 were ineligible mainly due to the fact that they had already received a first instance decision and were found not to have established their claim for international protection.  <\/p>  <p>  Qualified applicants are those who have not received a first instance decision within nine months, once the applicant meets that criteria there is no impediment in them getting the permission quickly and lawfully engaging in labour market activity. <\/p>  <p>  A permission to access the labour market is valid for a period of six months which may be renewed if the applicant has not received a final decision on their application within this timeframe.  As the Deputy will be aware, when an individual applies for international protection in Ireland they are given a temporary permission to remain in the State to allow their application to be processed.  The permission is temporary pending the processing of their application during which an applicant has not established a right to remain in the State on a permanent basis.  The processing of an application for international protection may result in a person being granted status, in which case they are entitled to access the labour market on the same basis as an Irish national.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also the case that the examination of an application for international protection can conclude that the applicant is not entitled to international protection and is not entitled to remain in the State and in that context it is appropriate that the labour market access permission is valid for a defined period of time.  <\/p>  <p>  The Regulations I have referred to provide access to both employment and self-employment in all sectors and categories of employment with the exception of the Civil and Public Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Defence Forces. The rationale for this is that it is a standard requirement of the Public Appointments Service when advertising a position in the Irish Public Service that eligibility to complete is open to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA).  Similar provisions apply in respect of Garda and Defence Force recruitment. This is the only limitation in relation to the labour market imposed by the regulations. <\/p>  <p>  I am unaware of any other limitation that the Deputy may be referring to other than in order to ensure that applicants are not exposed to the risk of exploitation or discrimination within the labour market, employers are required to apply the 50-50 rule when employing eligible applicants.  This rule required employers to show that at least 50% of their employees are EEA nationals.  Applicants will therefore have a national comparator within the workplace to safeguard their rights.  I do not see this as a limitation but as an essential workplace protection for the workers involved. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04600"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[45788\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the Greentown programme; and when the report will be released.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>The<b>&ldquo;<\/b>Greentown Report&rdquo;, about the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, was produced by the REPPP Project, (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice), at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL), and was published in December 2016.

The strategy will aim to recognise, acknowledge and respect diversity in Irish society, to attract, retain and develop a diverse workforce, and to provide opportunities for people to self-develop and promote their mental, physical, social health and sense of belonging.  The strategy will also have regard to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, 2014, specifically Section 42 which states that a public body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to the need to, eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services, and protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to whom it provides services.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Code of Ethic commits every person working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to recognising and respecting the dignity and equal human rights of all people.

This review is an Action Point, assigned to the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality, contained in the Government&rsquo;s plan to tackle White Collar Crime, which was launched last November. Attendees include all State bodies involved in the detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of White Collar Crime. <\/p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission report on Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences will be considered in detail by Mr Hamilton and his review group who had preliminary discussions about the report on 1 November.  The Group is working to a tight timeline and is due to report in June 2019.<\/p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, a number of important initiatives have recently commenced and extensive legislation was passed into law on 5   June 2018 and commenced in full on 30 July.  The Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act introduces a number of additional offences to give better effect to the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combatting Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, as well as providing for some of the recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  The Act creates several new offences to strengthen the law on corruption in Ireland.  New offences include:<\/p>  <p>  - Offering or agreeing to accept a gift, consideration or advantage to induce another person to exert an improper influence over an act of a foreign or public official<\/p>  <p>  - Making use of confidential information obtained in the course of duties by an official in order to gain an advantage.<\/p>  <p>  - Giving a gift, consideration or advantage where a person knows or reasonably ought to know that the gift will be used to facilitate a corruption offence. <\/p>  <p>  - A new strict liability offence for corporate bodies whose management, employees or subsidiaries commit a corruption offence with the intention of securing an advantage for the company. It shall be a defence for the body corporate to prove they took reasonable steps to prevent this. The penalty for conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine.<\/p>  <p>  The Act extends the categories of persons, to whom the presumptions relating to corrupt donations will apply, to include family members and close business associates, as recommended by the Mahon Tribunal. It also creates a presumption of corrupt enrichment whereby a public official who has not declared an interest in land or other property, when obliged to do so, can be presumed to have obtained it as an inducement or reward for doing an act in relation to his or her office.<\/p>  <p>  Penalties under the Act aim to be sufficiently strong to reflect the serious social and economic harm corruption can do, particularly when committed by public officials. Sentences of up to 10 years are provided for as well as unlimited fines upon conviction on indictment. The Act provides for a penalty of forfeiture of office if an Irish official is found guilty of corruption on indictment, as recommended by UNCAC. The forfeiture of office penalty will not apply where there is already a process for a position to be terminated by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, or where the power of removal is derived from a Constitutional power.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the responsibility to develop and implement anti-corruption policies does not rest with any one single body or Department in Ireland. The competence to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute corruption is spread across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of other agencies with a mandate to tackle corruption. These include tribunals of inquiry, commissions of investigation, inspectors, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO), local authorities, the Ombudsman, Parliamentary Committees on Members' Interests, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Public Accounts Committee and the Director of Public Prosecutions.<\/p>  <p>  Equally, legislative provisions to prevent corruption are manifold and not exclusive to my Department. For example, the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, addresses the ethical conduct of public officials and the lobbying of public officials is covered by the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. The Standards in Public Office Commission is responsible for regulatory functions in relation to these statutes.

The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference. <\/p>  <p>  The Report makes many innovative proposals aimed at strengthening our national security arrangements; empowering the Garda Commissioner to ensure more effective management of the Garda organisation; supporting the governance of the Garda organisation through the introduction of a Board and reforming the method of recruitment and training of Garda&iacute;. It also makes recommendations on external oversight arrangements as well as a recommendation on the Commissioner's future engagement with the Oireachtas. <\/p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is receiving thorough consideration. My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the Commissioner and the oversight bodies as well as other Departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations. In addition, I look forward to hearing the response of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality  to the report in the coming days. Once this process is complete I will return to Government in December to discuss my substantive response to the report, as well as a high level implementation plan. <\/p>  <p>  I would take this opportunity to refer to the public commentary to date on the Commission's proposals to ensure effective accountability, some of which appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the report, and in particular, a sense that public scrutiny of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would disappear. It is clear from the report that public scrutiny, perhaps the strongest tool at the disposal of the Policing Authority would continue under any new arrangements. I note that the Chair of the Commission, Ms Kathleen O'Toole also took the opportunity to address this misunderstanding during her engagement with the Joint Justice and Equality Committee on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  On the publication of the report in September, I set out my intention to move quickly on establishing the implementation structures recommended by the Commission to drive forward the transformation programme.  There has been very significant progress in this regard. The Implementation Group on Policing Reform (the IGPR) has been established as recommended by the Commission. I am pleased to say that Ms Helen Ryan, a member of the Commission, has agreed to act as chair. The IGPR is supported by an Implementation Programme Office established in the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  While the programme of reform that the Commission has outlined is undoubtedly an opportunity for transformational change, it is also extremely challenging, requiring actions across Government. It is prudent that we take some time now to ensure that the necessary structures and resources are in place to deliver this programme of transformation. It will take time to fully implement the recommendations in the report and the Commission has suggested that the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022 would be an appropriate target for the transformation to be completed.  I share that ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":119,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB06800"},{"type":"question","counter":120,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[49718\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900069#WRB06900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps being taken to ensure that residents in direct provision centres are being advised of their right to vote in local elections in 2019; and the way in which contact with candidates will be facilitated in order that residents can engage fully with the democratic process.","asker":"1287","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":121,"content":"<p>The Department of Justice and Equality, through the Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), has always facilitated and encouraged the registration of and voting by protection applicants in local elections.<\/p>  <p>  The general policy in relation to local elections has been to allow candidates to drop off election leaflets which could be placed in a common area in the centre where they could be picked up by residents.

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale. <\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most.  More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.  <\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition.  While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay.  Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan.  On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently, including this week, where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation.    <\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan, and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and to empower civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are also actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November. <\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900070#WRC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":137,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900070#WRC01600"},{"type":"question","counter":138,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[49878\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900070#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the United Kingdom will be leaving the European Economic Area on 29 March 2019 even if the transition arrangement is agreed;

In 2015 it came within the scope of the European Commission's General Block Exemption Regulation (&ldquo;GBER&rdquo;). A number of changes were made to EII in Finance Act 2015 and Finance Act 2017 to ensure conformity with GBER. The latter changes came into effect on 1 January 2018.<\/p><p>Revenue advise me that of the cases currently being processed by the EII Branch, over 80% have required follow-up correspondence. While some of those are requests for clarifications, the majority relate to incomplete applications. Revenue require that applications are completed in their entirety, with all necessary documentation included, as a decision will be delayed where Revenue must seek further information from a company. With regard to the particular case, Revenue advise me that the company applied for EII relief on 20 April 2018 and received a request for information on 22 June. The information requested was submitted to Revenue on 9 October and on 19 October. Revenue then issued a response on 23 November highlighting areas where, based on the information provided, it believes the investment did not qualify for relief. <\/p><p>Regarding the issue of Revenue and contact from the public, Revenue advise me that its EII Branch has a dedicated phone line specifically for EII queries and the number is available at the following link:<\/p><p><i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/starting-a-business\/initiatives-for-startup-businesses-and-smes\/the-employment-and-investment-incentive-eii-for-companies.aspx.<\/i><\/p><p>This phone line is available between the hours of 9.30am to 1.30pm Monday to Friday to deal with queries from companies. <\/p><p>The Deputy also raised the issue of pre-approval; Revenue advise me that, under the EII legislative provisions currently in force, it offers &ldquo;outline approval&rdquo; to companies who are uncertain as to whether or not they are qualifying companies.  Revenue further advise that this is an opinion that it issues, based on the information provided and processed in line with the presumption of honesty set out in their Customer Service Charter and that obtaining outline approval is not a guarantee that relief will be given. Whether or not an investment meets the criteria set out in law can only be determined once that investment is made.<\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, on foot of recommendations set out in the independent review of EII and the Start-Up Relief for Entrepreneurs scheme recently carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants, I have moved to change the administration of EII to a largely self-certification model in Finance Bill 2018.

In relation to question 49969\/18, ABER entered into force on 1 July 2014 and has had direct effect in all Member States since then.  This means that the ABER rules apply directly to beneficiaries in Ireland regardless of our domestic Irish law and without having to be enacted in our tax legislation.  Sections 21 (income tax and corporation tax measures) and 48 (stamp duty measures) of Finance Bill 2018 as passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann propose amendments to the relevant domestic tax legislation to provide greater clarity for the farming sector in relation to the ABER rules. <\/p>  <p>  Article 18 of ABER sets out the specific requirements for the granting of start-up aid to young farmers, and the development of small farms, and stipulates, inter alia, that the amount of aid per young farmer is to be limited to &euro;70,000.  This limit is a lifetime limit that applies to the cumulative aid received under all schemes covered by Article 18 of ABER.  The relevant schemes are: <\/p>  <p>  - transfers of land to young trained farmers under section 81AA Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999;  <\/p>  <p>  - stock relief under section 667B Taxes Consolidation Act 1997; <\/p>  <p>  - farm succession partnerships under section 667D Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.<\/p>  <p>  The limits contained in the Finance Bill, once enacted, will be applied to claims for relief made in relation to stamp duty for transfers or conveyances of land executed on or after 1 January 2019, and for the year of assessment 2019 and subsequent years of assessment for stock relief and succession farm partnership relief.  Anyone submitting a stamp duty return for conveyances or transfers of land executed on or after 1 January 2019, or income tax or corporation tax returns for the 2019 year of assessment onwards, must have regard to the amount of relief claimed since 1 July 2014. The total amount claimed over the period must not exceed &euro;70,000. <\/p>  <p>  As regards question 49967\/18 and the example mentioned by the deputy, the inheritance of a family farm does not attract a stamp duty charge and, thus, is not affected by the &euro;70,000 limit. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to question 49968\/18, I am advised by Revenue that the amount of aid granted under any of the three relevant schemes since 1 July 2014 must be taken into account when claiming any further relief in relation to stamp duty for transfers or conveyances of land executed on or after 1 January 2019, and for the year of assessment 2019 and subsequent years of assessment for stock relief and succession farm partnership relief.  It should be emphasized that this is not a case of the retrospective application of the limit, as, as noted above, the EU Regulation that introduced it on 1 July 2014 had immediate legal effect in all EU Member States. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900070#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Documents Issuance","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900070#WRC06100"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[49970\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900070#WRC06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is guidance from the Revenue Commissioners or otherwise for the farming sector in relation to section 21 of the Finance Bill 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>Section 21 of Finance Bill 2018  includes a range of amendments to Part 23 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Farming and Market Gardening).

At present such farmers are not entitled to elect for income averaging. The change is intended to assist those farmers dealing with income volatility by maximising the number of farmers who are eligible to opt in to the regime, and should allow for increased uptake of the scheme, with the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association having previously estimated that some 5,000 farmers were unable to enter averaging as a result of the current restriction on those with off-farm trading income. <\/p>  <p>  Section 21 also amends section 667B (stock relief for young trained farmers) and 667D (Succession Farm Partnerships) to ensure conformity of those sections with the applicable rules on State Aid under the Agricultural Block Exemption Regulation.

It seeks to make financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent. It was transposed by S.I. (375\/2017) and entered into application on 3 January 2018, simultaneously revoking the MiFID 1 Regulations. However, it is necessary to provide for criminal sanctions and penalties in respect of infringements outlined in MiFID 2 in primary law, hence the need for the Markets in Financial Instruments Bill 2018, recently enacted in October this year. The Bill provides that a person guilty of an offence under certain provisions of the MiFID 2 regulations, such as operating without authorisation, is liable on conviction on indictment to a maximum penalty of &euro;10 million and\/or imprisonment for ten years. This is a continuation of the criminal sanctions regime that existed under MiFID 1. I believe putting in place criminal sanctions for serious infringement of the MiFID rules will provide a deterrent effect against any blatant misbehaviour and thus promote orderly markets, market integrity &amp;amp; investor protection. This Bill has passed all stages in the Oireachtas and was signed into law by the President on 29 October 2018.<\/p><p><b>Revenue Commissioners:<\/b><\/p><p>Ireland has implemented the Common Reporting Standard which provides for the automatic exchange of financial account information between tax authorities. The first information exchanges were completed in September 2017, with the tax authorities of 50 jurisdictions participating. In September 2018, 91 jurisdictions&rsquo; tax authorities completed exchanges. The information received by the Revenue Commissioners is being used to identify tax defaulters. The Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with my Department, continue to monitor whether any additional powers or resources are currently required. Any such measures identified are then proposed to me as Minister for Finance for appropriate action. <\/p><p>Last year, the Revenue Commissioners collected a record &euro;70.96 billion for the Exchequer (net figure &euro;50.76 billion). <\/p><p>- During 2017, Revenue completed 655,557 compliance interventions, which yielded &euro;491.9 million in tax, interest and penalties. <\/p><p>- 5,220 audits were carried out yielding &euro;196.3 million and 66 investigations yielding &euro;7.5 million in tax, interest and penalties. <\/p><p>- In addition, Revenue has received &euro;88.2 million from 2,890 disclosures in the final offshore disclosure settlement opportunity. Tax defaulters who use offshore facilities to hide undeclared income or assets can now no longer make a qualifying disclosure and Revenue are using the information they receive from other jurisdictions to identify such tax defaulters. They now face penalties of up to 100% of the tax evaded, publication as tax defaulters and potentially, criminal prosecution.<\/p><p>Where tax evasion is uncovered, Revenue will apply the maximum sanctions and deterrents including penalties, publication, and criminal prosecution.  <\/p><p>- In 2017, there were 24 criminal convictions for serious evasion and fraud convictions, and 911 summary criminal convictions with a total of &euro;2.44 million imposed in fines. <\/p><p>Since May 2018, with the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Public Prosecutions secured 2 high-profile criminal convictions relating to revenue offences.

My Department is currently transposing this provision by way of a Statutory Instrument. This work is well advanced and the transposition is expected to be concluded soon. Article 31 of the 5th Anti-Money-Laundering Directive requires that trustees of express trusts hold up-to-date information regarding the trusts&rsquo; beneficial ownership and requires that, for trusts governed under its law, each Member State hold this information in a central register.

Work has also begun on changes to the probate information currently available on the Courts Service website, including a more detailed section highlighting issues in papers submitted that could cause a delay to processing papers. The Courts Service has also informed me that work on changes to the Rules of the Superior Courts, required to implement some of the recommendations, is underway.<\/p><p>The Courts Service has indicated that work will begin shortly developing a detailed business case for an online eProbate system which will replace most of the more traditional channels used heretofore and will represent a significant change in how this service will be delivered.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan sets out the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling organised crime activity, with an emphasis on its continued commitment to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised criminal activities.  <\/p>  <p>  In tackling such activity, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. In addition, the increased Government investment in the Garda fleet will allow Garda&iacute; to continue to effectively police our roads network. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that, as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders, including the farming organisations. In that connection, Operation Thor has yielded significant results in tackling property related crime and burglary, including in rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Operation Hybrid was established to coordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and address concerns about community safety. That Operation benefits from significant support by Armed Support Units.<\/p>  <p>  As of 18 November, Operation Hybrid has resulted in: 84 arrests, 11 charges in total, 37 firearms seized, 283 searches carried out, 16,821 lines of enquiry conducted with more than 71,600 high visibility checkpoints, implemented with support from Armed Support Units. A significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence has also been examined. Garda&iacute; have had notable successes in targeting the drugs trade, which fuels the activities of organised criminals, resulting in significant seizures of drugs, firearms and information on financial transactions..<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that for reasons of security it would not be appropriate to go into the details of the particular arrangements that the Garda Authorities have in place in respect of the security of cash-in-transit transfers.  What I can say is that combatting and disrupting attempts by organised criminal gangs to commit cash robberies, often carried out with the threat or use of violence, is a priority for the Garda&iacute;.  The Garda&iacute; work on an ongoing basis with the financial institutions and the security companies involved to enhance the protection of the individuals involved in carrying out this business and to facilitate the security of the arrangements in place for the transfer of cash. <\/p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised criminal activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made. <\/p>  <p>  For it's part the Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. The Government will also continue to progress the accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing overall Garda numbers (including civilians) to 21,000 by 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE05100"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[50018\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of extra garda&iacute; likely to become available throughout the regions, including community garda&iacute;, arising from recent graduations from the Garda college; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[50021\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the degree to which Garda numbers in each division are likely to be enhanced following recent graduations from Templemore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 121 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. <\/p><p>The  Deputy is aware that the moratorium on Garda Recruitment introduced in 2009 resulted in a reduction in Garda numbers across the organisation. Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. <\/p><p>I look forward to attending the attestation of another 200 recruits tomorrow which will see Garda numbers reach 14,000 by the end of this year. This and ongoing recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources to increase Garda visibility in our communities and to support all Garda activity including community policing.<\/p><p>In relation to the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;, it is important to note that these probationer Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they gain the breadth of policing experience required and are properly supervised, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Every community, whether urban or rural, is recognised as having its own concerns and expectations and to that end every Garda member while carrying out their duties is considered a community Garda.

The Government's commitment in this regard is evidenced by the significant additional funding that has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years in response  to increased gang-related violence and crime.<\/p>  <p>  The question of providing for an offence of membership of a criminal gang, in a manner similar to the approach taken in the Offences Against the State Acts with regard to membership of a proscribed organisation, has arisen from time to time.  In this regard, it is important to understand the issues which arise in seeking to simply outlaw membership of a criminal gang in such a manner. Most significant here is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships, alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  However, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime.  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not. Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were also introduced aiding prosecution of the offences provided for under the Act.  The Act also provides that where a serious offence is committed as part of, or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to utilise all available legislation, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 referred to above, in their ongoing efforts to tackle organised crime activity.  <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Policing Plan sets out the priorities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling organised crime activity including its continued commitment to pro-actively target groups and individuals engaged in criminal activity, including organised criminal activities.  <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methodologies. Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure the activities of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprise are effectively targeted, including through the use of proceeds of crime legislation, money-laundering legislation, the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 relating to organised crime and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  While we should not underestimate the difficulties which the Garda authorities face in tackling organised crime activity, we continue to see the significant results of their efforts in the arrests made and persons being brought before the Courts, as well as the ongoing drugs and firearms seizures made.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Operations","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE06500"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[50036\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900072#WRE06600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date for each of the action points made in the report Measures to Enhance Ireland's Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework published in November 2017 that fall under his remit; if each such action point has been completed, not completed or is ongoing, respectively; and the revised deadlines for action points not delivered by the original timeframes in tabular form.","asker":"1229","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy, insofar as my Department is concerned, is outlined in the table below. <table><tr><th>Progress on Measures to Enhance Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate, Economic, and Regulatory Framework<br \/><br \/><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><br \/><br \/><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Action Point No. <\/td><td>Action Point <\/td><td>Timeline <\/td><td>Relevant Bodies <\/td><td>Lead\/Owner<\/td><td>Progress<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6<\/td><td>Review anti-corruption and anti-fraud structures. <\/td><td>Q2 2018 <\/td><td>Department of Justice and Equality, Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, Department of Finance, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. <\/td><td>Department of Justice and Equality<\/td><td>The Review is being taken forward by former DPP and Anti-Corruption Expert Mr James Hamilton.

As we draw closer to full employment, it is essential that enterprise in Ireland has access to high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent pools. My Department closely monitors the trends concerning labour market participation rates. As it stands the participation rate in Ireland (62.3%) is above the European average (58.1%) and this is the case for both men and women, as evidenced in the most recent Eurostat Labour Force Survey. <\/p><p>My Department actively contributes to ensuring that suitable policy responses are put in place to support continued and increased participation. For example, Action 28 of the Action Plan for Jobs 2018 commits to identifying<i>'relevant policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates based on patterns of labour market participation<\/i>&rsquo;. My Department has lead responsibility on this action. Policy responsibility for participation rates falls across multiple government departments and my Department is currently working with these departments to ensure the completion of this action by the end of the year. <\/p><p>On 18 July last, the Government agreed to the development of Future Jobs, a new programme of focused actions for 2019, and thereafter, which will form a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic agenda over the medium term. This is a whole of government approach aiming to: enhance productivity; ensure quality and sustainable jobs; and build a resilient and innovative economy.

As that strategy highlights, 'Given the changing demand for skills, increasing people's lifelong learning activity, especially those in the workforce, is a vital element of Ireland's future skills development and can have a positive impact on productivity and innovation at firm level and nationally'.<\/p><p>The strategy aims to increase engagement in lifelong learning through increased promotion and communication of its benefits, more and easier opportunities for those in employment to engage in education and training, greater recognition of workplace learning and prior learning, and the significant strengthening of career guidance.<\/p><p>From a baseline lifelong learning participation rate of 6.7% in 2014 (population aged 25-64), the National Skills Strategy set a lifelong learning participation target of 10% by 2020, and 15% by 2025. In 2017, Ireland's lifelong learning participation rate was 8.9%, compared with an EU average of 10.7%.<\/p><p>Lifelong Learning is key consideration in developing actions under <i>Future Jobs &ndash; Preparing Now for Tomorrow&rsquo;s Economy<\/i>. Future Jobs will form a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic agenda over the medium term to ensure we are well positioned to adapt to the technological and other transformational changes our economy and society will face in the years ahead.<\/p><p>The development and implementation of Future Jobs is being led jointly by the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department and is organised around five pillars, namely: Improving Productivity, particularly in Irish Small and Medium Sized Enterprises; Supporting Innovation and Technological Change; Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent; Increasing Participation in the Labour Force; and Successfully Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy.<\/p><p>A key factor to Ireland&rsquo;s successful transition to a digital and low carbon based economy will be having a well-skilled workforce capable of adapting to new challenges. Soft skills, transversal skills and the mastery of core competencies in numeracy, literacy and digital technologies remain critical for employees in all sectors, and opportunities to develop and enhance these skills are vital. Advanced cognitive skills, problem solving, logic, social and emotional skills are particularly important in the development of competences needed to adapt to and respond to the changes that may occur due to technological advancement. Students and learners at all levels of the education and training system need to be given the opportunity to acquire these skills both during their initial formal education and throughout their lives.<\/p><p>Therefore, we need to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s lifelong learning provision to help workers re-skill throughout their working lives. Enterprises, and SMEs in particular, also need to invest in upskilling and re-skilling their workforce, including their managerial capacity, to enhance and maintain productivity; to adapt to technological disruption; and to identify and exploit opportunities from the digital and low carbon economies as they emerge. Future Jobs, which will be launched early in 2019, will map out the supporting actions for 2019 as well as framing the longer term agenda.<\/p><p>These objectives were strongly supported by participants at the successful national summit on Future Jobs which took place on 22nd November last which brought together over 200 attendees representing employers, workers, academia, civic society, state agencies and public administration to discuss future challenges and opportunities with myself and other ministerial colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[50040\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of persons as a percentage classified as underemployed out of the number employed in each of the years 2005 to 2017 and to date in 2018, in tabular form.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>CSO data on underemployment is only available from 2008 onwards.

Therefore, any adjustments to the strict qualifying criteria fall to that Department to address.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. These supports aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  A number of schemes have been developed to mitigate against the effects of Brexit.  In late November 2017 a Rescue and Restructuring (R&amp;R) Scheme was approved by the EU Commission. This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.   <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in April 2018 and provides affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future, to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenge.  <\/p>  <p>  In May 2018, the Rescue and Restructuring scheme was extended to include temporary restructuring aid for enterprises experiencing acute liquidity needs.  The aid is granted in the form of loans repayable over a period of 18 months.  Together with the Brexit Loan Scheme, this temporary restructuring aid will provide valuable stabilisation to businesses as they respond to the immediate and long-term impacts of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  It will provide low cost loans for terms of between 8-10 years, which is not readily available on the market.  It is expected that this scheme will be operational in Q1 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Office funding has been increased and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The suite of LEO Brexit supports includes tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online \"Brexit SME Scorecard\" to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a \"Be Prepared Grant\" to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK. <\/p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland's Brexit advisory service was established in May 2017 to provide a focal point for SMEs working to navigate the changes in cross-Border trading relationships brought about by Brexit negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  As part of awareness-raising activities, EI has rolled out regional Brexit Advisory clinics throughout the year.  My Department and its agencies have also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready roadshow to inform businesses of supports available to them to prepare for Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are point of a Technical Working Group on State aid which also comprises representatives from DG Competition, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State aid rules.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":343,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF01500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Remuneration","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[50029\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an organisation (details supplied) will be included in the pay restoration process in view of the urgent need to improve the remuneration for these workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>As you know, in February 2018, an agreement was reached at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) between the Department, the HSE and health sector Trade Unions in relation to a process aimed at resolving the pay restoration issue for staff employed by section 39 bodies in 50 pilot organisations.

Each year, 3.3 million patients attend Hospital Outpatient clinics for appointments. While the total numbers on the outpatient waiting list continues to grow, a targeted approach by the HSE in late 2017 and into 2018 has impacted on the level of growth. From January to September 2018, the rate of growth of the outpatient waiting list was a quarter of what it was in the same period in 2017. <\/p><p>This year &euro;55 million was allocated to the NTPF to provide treatment for patients. This has been increased to a total of &euro;75 million for 2019 and as a result of this additional funding, my Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a Scheduled Care Access Plan for inpatients\/day case and outpatients for 2019. <\/p><p>I recently met with the CEO's of all hospital groups and requested that they develop innovative proposals to address their outpatient lists in 2019. <\/p><p>In 2019, the NTPF will continue to work closely with Hospital Groups, inviting proposals to facilitate the trialling of funded interventions, including weekend and out of hours clinics, to tackle Outpatient Waiting lists. This year has seen the NTPF approve almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments and this is projected to increase to 40,000 appointments next year. In addition, validation will play a key in ensuring the accuracy of the outpatient waiting list, and it is envisioned that 30,000 patients will be removed from the outpatient waiting list through the validation consultation process in 2019. <\/p><p>As part of its work to address long-waiters, I understand that Tallaght University Hospital has engaged with the NTPF to propose a number of insourcing and outsourcing initiatives that can help to address the outpatient lists. This has seen the NTPF approve proposals to treat more than 2,200 outpatients across a range of specialties at Tallaght, through the provision of an additional 177 outpatient clinics. <\/p><p>Tallaght University Hospital advises that it has also sought innovative solutions to long waiting lists, including investment in a Waiting List Decision Support System (DSS) which plans and forecasts outpatient demand, allowing the hospital to ensure planned improvements are delivered. Tallaght has also recently recruited new consultants in orthopaedics, neurology, and ENT, in order to arrest the growth in waiting lists for these areas. In addition, the appointment of additional Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANP) in areas such as Rheumatology, and the establishment of more physio led clinics in specialties like Gynaecology, is projected to have a positive impact on outpatient waiting lists as we move into 2019. <\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the table below.<\/p><p><i>Outpatient Waiting List in Tallaght Hospital  - Based on latest published NTPF figures<\/i><table><tr><th>0-3 mths <\/th><th>3-6 mths <\/th><th>6-9 mths <\/th><th>9-12mths <\/th><th>12-15mths <\/th><th>15-18 mths <\/th><th>18-21 mths <\/th><th>21-24mths <\/th><th>24-36 mths <\/th><th>36-48 mths <\/th><th>48+mths <\/th><th>Total <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>6893 <\/td><td>5021 <\/td><td>3466 <\/td><td>2522 <\/td><td>2516 <\/td><td>1931 <\/td><td>1419 <\/td><td>1024 <\/td><td>2740 <\/td><td>1128 <\/td><td>117 <\/td><td>28777 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme Administration","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[49892\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900073#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the new arrangements in relation to the fair deal scheme will be introduced; if legislation is required to change the rules for same to introduce a three year cap on the inclusion of productive assets in the assessment or as part of the assessment for the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":371,"content":"<p>The proposed policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), to cap contributions from farm assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government.

While the total numbers on the outpatient waiting list continues to grow, a targeted approach by the HSE in late 2017 and into 2018 has impacted on the level of growth. From January to September 2018, the rate of growth of the outpatient waiting list was a quarter of what it was in the same period in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, this year has seen the NTPF approve almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments nationally and this is projected to increase to 40,000 appointments next year.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, validation will play a key role in ensuring the accuracy of the outpatient waiting list and it is projected that 30,000 patients will be removed from the national outpatient waiting list through the validation consultation process in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The South-South West Hospital Group and NTPF have advised that they are working closely to deliver initiatives aimed at tackling Outpatient Waiting lists.

The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) will target the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves - measuring the liveweight of the calf at weaning as a percentage of the cow's liveweight. <\/p>  <p>  Building on the success of the Beef Data and Genomics Programme, the data collected will also be a valuable addition to Ireland's already impressive database on cattle genomics. <\/p>  <p>  Details of the scheme will be announced in due course following further consultation.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to move to a &euro;200 suckler payment. As I have stated previously, targeted supports for the sector will continue to focus on economic and environmental efficiency in the sector in order to help ensure its long term viability. The following outlines the supports for the suckler sector which are currently in place. According to National Farm Survey data, suckler farmers currently receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors, including the suckler sector in preparation for the next iteration of the CAP.  The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the relevant research and the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised. <\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020. In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.  <\/p>  <p>    I am conscious that this has been a difficult year for the sector in terms of weather and the range of challenges associated with it. At the latest meeting of the Beef Roundtable on 3 October, I highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their inter-dependency. I urged processors to engage positively with their farmer suppliers to build the sustainability of the sector as a whole and to ensure a reasonable return for the farmers upon whom the sector relies for its development.  It is essential that the position of the primary producer in the supply chain be secured if we are to build a sector for the future.<\/p>  <p>   The Beef Roundtable also included discussions on the potential for producer organisations and the development of new technologies as ways of adding value along the whole supply chain, all tools to build resilience in the sector. Producer Organisations would allow farmers to engage collectively with processors, with the aim of strengthening farmers' bargaining power. Additionally, I have asked Bord Bia to conduct a detailed examination of market dynamics, with the cooperation of the industry, taking into account sales of particular cuts into particular segments of the market in order to improve price transparency.<\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the existing range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector. According to National Farm Survey dats, suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.  The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot is a positive step in that direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900074#WRG06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme Eligibility","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900074#WRG06900"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[49964\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900074#WRG07000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the new townlands in County Tipperary that will be eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme that were not eligible for the 2018 ANC scheme; the townlands in County Tipperary that will not be eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme that were eligible for the 2018 ANC scheme.","asker":"1350","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>A listing of Tipperary townlands newly eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme and the townlands no longer eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme is attached.

This has caused significant hardship and additional costs for many of our farmers. <\/p>  <p>  So far, response options have been reactive in nature with ad hoc schemes being introduced to provide support to those who have been adversely affected by these weather related events. <\/p>  <p>  Given the increase in the number of such weather events, I believe it is opportune to examine implementable solutions. <\/p>  <p>  It is important in the first instance to acknowledge that the CAP itself, whether through price supports under Pillar 1, or physical measures under Pillar 2, does provide support to stabilise farm incomes, as well as improving on-farm structural and environmental resilience.  However further consideration needs to be given as to how we can assist farmers in better managing risks.  It is clear that we need to examine additional measures that will enhance the resilience of farmers in their ability to respond and adapt to adverse events.  The CAP post 2020 proposals have rightly raised this issue.  <\/p>  <p>  There are nine principal objectives underpinning the future CAP. Amongst other issues, these are clear in recognising the role agriculture has to play in meeting our environmental and climate change targets.  The agriculture sector is vulnerable to climate change, in terms of the impact adverse weather events have had on food production and crop yields. Actions under the CAP are expected to contribute 40% of the overall financial envelope of the CAP to climate objectives. <\/p>  <p>  Pillar 2 schemes such as agri-environment and risk management measures can encourage farmers to farm in a more sustainable environmental friendly way, while at the same time provide support to farmers to help them better manage the risks.  Since the needs and circumstances of farmers are very different between, and indeed within, Member States, it is important that Member States are afforded sufficient flexibility at national level to assess the risk management instruments appropriate to their farmers, whether these be based on combating income instability or addressing a range of physical risks.  I am open to exploring other options including Insurance Schemes and Mutual Funds. <\/p>  <p>  It is of course worth noting that we are in the process of negotiating these draft proposals.  I will continue to work hard to ensure the best possible outcome for Irish farmers in the CAP post 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900075#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme Eligibility","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900075#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[49990\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900075#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the new townlands that will be eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme that were not eligible for the 2018 scheme; and the townlands that will not be eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme that were eligible for the 2018, scheme in tabular form.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>A listing of townlands newly eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme and the townlands no longer eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme is attached.

The review, required by legislation, was carried out by independent consultants, KPMG.  It examines the projected income and expenditure of the SIF over the course of the 55 year period from 2016 to 2071.<\/p><p>As part of the review the independent consultants were required to project the additional PRSI expenditure if invalidity pension and illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits were extended to class S self-employed workers and the PRSI contribution rates required to provide these benefits on a revenue neutral basis.<\/p><p>The Actuarial Review calculated the first year cost in 2018 and the cost of the schemes out to 2071.  The table below shows the estimated cost of extending carer's and illness benefits in the first year and the estimated cost by 2025 as follows:<table><tr><th><\/th><th>First Year<\/th><th>2025<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carer's Benefit<\/td><td>&euro;3m<\/td><td>&euro;6m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>&euro;40m<\/td><td>&euro;108<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The review indicates that, where these benefits are extended to the self-employed, the class S rate of PRSI contribution would need to increase substantially in order to ensure that the benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  It estimates that when expenditure on the additional benefits is considered over the entire projection period, PRSI rates would need to increase by 94% under a scenario of no subvention from the exchequer.  This is equivalent to an increase of the Class S contribution rate from the current 4% rate to 7.8%.<\/p><p>This increased contribution is attributable to the costs of extending these additional benefits to PRSI class S contributors.  It does not take account of the value to PRSI class S contributors of access to the range of existing benefits, and in particular State pension contributory.  The consultants estimated that the typical cost of State pension (contributory) on its own is of the order of 10% to 15%, depending on other factors including rate of average earnings and date of commencing paying PRSI.  Adding in the other benefits referenced the total class S rate of contribution to ensure revenue neutrality would be of the order of 20% per annum.<\/p><p>Self-employed workers who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and treatment benefit.  Entitlement to invalidity pension was extended to the self-employed from December 2017.  As you aware extension of jobseeker's benefit was announced in Budget 2019.<\/p><p>This compares favourably with employees who, in general, are liable to the class A rate of 4%.  In addition their employers are liable to PRSI at the rate of 8.6% on weekly earnings up to and including &euro;376 or at the rate of 10.85% where weekly earnings exceed &euro;376.  Accordingly the combined rate of PRSI rate paid in respect of class A employees is 12.6% or 14.85%, depending on the level of weekly earnings.  These class A employees are entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits.<\/p><p>The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the SIF in the years ahead, including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900077#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Applications","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900077#WRK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[50044\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900077#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an illness benefit payment for a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>The letter received by the person concerned dated the 8th November 2018 regarding Illness Benefit inadvertently issued and can be ignored.

As signalled in Budget 2018, the rate of the levy has been increased to 7% for sites on a local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards.<\/p><p>My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively almost 300 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 140 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim. <\/p><p>Based on the current legislative provisions and a recent review of the sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be &euro;9m in 2019 (applying the current 3% levy rate on the overall market value of sites of &euro;300m) and &euro;28.2m in 2020  (applying the increased 7% levy rate on the overall market value of sites of over &euro;400m). The latter estimate for 2020 is based on the number of sites currently included on the local vacant site registers and in respect of which market valuations have been attached to the registered sites. It is expected that the number of registered sites in respect of which market valuations will be obtained will increase in the coming months which should result in an increase in the estimated levy proceeds nationally for 2020.<\/p><p>Owners of vacant sites may make an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la against the entry of a site on the register, the notice of entry on the register and the demand for payment of the levy by a planning authority. An appeal can also be made to the Valuation Tribunal against a planning authority's determination of the market value of a site.<\/p><p>To date, 137 appeals have been made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as follows:<table><tr><th>Appeal<\/th><th>Received<\/th><th>Disposed  (formally   decided)<\/th><th>Otherwise Disposed (Invalid\/     Withdrawn)<\/th><th>Appeal rejected (Entry     confirmed)<\/th><th>Appeal accepted (entry to be     cancelled)<\/th><th>Appeal yet to be decided<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Entry on the register<\/td><td>122<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>37<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Notice   of entry on register<\/td><td>15<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>13<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>There have been no appeals to the Board against the demand for payment of the levy as under the provisions of the Act, 1 January 2019 is the earliest date on which a demand for payment can be made in respect of a site on the register in 2018. <\/p><p>In addition, to date there have been 9 appeals submitted to the Valuation Tribunal against market valuation determinations made by planning authorities.

The sale and any apportionment of the property into lots is a commercial matter for the vendor.<\/p>  <p>  While the lands in question would represent a significant addition to the stock of publicly owned heritage properties and lands, my Department could, as stressed previously,  only consider acquiring this property if the price fell to within a certain range, or in the context of a donation or bequest. This is known to the Vendors. Through the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), my Department manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks and reserves of approximately 87,000 hectares. These important biodiversity areas are located all around the country including a large area of County Wicklow, and the 5,000 hectares of lands in Glenasmole purchased in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, the Glenasmole purchase of 5,000 hectares sets a precedent, and although the circumstance pertaining are very dissimilar, it is certainly a market factor. As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, it would not be appropriate of me to seek to negotiate indirectly or publicly. Suffice it to say that I am aware of the public-good value of this property, balanced across a range of demands across my Department. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the use of the area by  hillwalkers, climbers and the public in general, as I have stated previously, I have no statutory function regarding the provision of access to private lands. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Estate has allowed a permissive access to its hugely popular walking route for many decades and I would hope that this would continue under any new ownership arrangements and my Department has conveyed this desire directly to the vendors and their agent.<\/p>  <p>   As outlined in my earlier replies, my Department's relationship with the Guinness Estate here, and more generally, has been positive. It is one of mutual respect and good neighbours, and indeed often working together on shared issue of interest. These include herd management and husbandry, habitat oversight, film-making, signage, visitor accommodation, trail maintenance and designation management. Indeed, for the most part, the boundary between the private estate and the National Park is invisible to the visitor and tourist, with pre-imminence being given to the idyllic shared land, lake and mountainscape.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900077#WRK06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Coursing Club","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900077#WRK06600"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[49944\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112900077#WRK06700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if footage of a coursing event (details supplied) in November 2018, in County Limerick available to view on a website will be reviewed; her views regarding the coursing industry; her plans in relation to same in view of the evidence that it is beyond regulation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":691,"content":"<p>The meeting in question in Co.
