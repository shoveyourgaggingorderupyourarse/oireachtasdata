The amendments concern the insertion of definitions of &quot;communications media&quot; and &quot;social media platform&quot; specifically to cover the two mediums to ensure that secondary ticket sellers comply with section 17.  The concern, as I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate, is that social media platforms are not included.  These are fairly technical amendments.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the definitions already contained in the Bill do not need to be strengthened?  In my experience, small as it is - it is a long time since I bought a lot of tickets for concerts - tickets are quite regularly sold on social media platforms as well as on traditional media such as other websites and all the rest.  People share and advertise much of this information on social media.  I just want to be satisfied that the definitions contained in the legislation will be sufficient to cover any possible scenario.  We know social media and the social media platforms are very fast-moving technologies but, to the greatest extent possible, we need to be satisfied that all eventualities are catered for, and that has to include social media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021060200002#A00800","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I fully appreciate from where she is coming.  I hope that the official explanation I will provide will relieve her anxiety or confirm there is no need for this amendment and that, for that reason, we are not proposing to accept it.  The proposed amendments to section 17(1) and section 17(2) are unnecessary in my view.  The amendment to section 17(2) is also drafted in such a way that it would not achieve its aim.  The definitions amendments Nos. 1 and 2 propose to insert in section 2 are necessary only if amendments Nos. 8 and 9 to section 17 are adopted.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of the four amendments is essentially to broaden the scope of sections 17(1) and 17(2) so that the information requirements for secondary ticket sellers in section 17(1), and the obligation on secondary ticket operators in section 17(2) to ensure that secondary ticket sellers comply with these requirements, would apply to advertisements or offers for the sale of tickets or ticket packages on social media platforms and through communications media as well on secondary ticket marketplaces.  The addition of a reference to social media platforms in sections 17(1) and (2) is not necessary as these platforms come within the scope of \"secondary ticket marketplace\" as that term is defined in section 2(1), that is, a website, online service, electronic application or print publication which provides a secondary ticket seller with a facility for the sale or advertising for sale of tickets or ticket packages, including a marketplace that also provides a facility for the sale or supply, or advertising for sale or supply, of goods or services.  Like the proposed definition of social media platform, the definition of secondary ticket marketplace refers to a website and an application.  It is broader than the corresponding part of the proposed definition of social media platform in that in also includes an online service.  The second part of the definition of secondary ticket marketplace makes clear that the term includes marketplaces that provide a facility for the sale or supply of services or goods other than tickets.<\/p> <p>  The addition of a reference to electronic communications media in sections 17(1) and (2) is unnecessary for various reasons.  Secondary ticket sellers do not advertise or offer tickets for sale on the broadcasting services and platforms that come within the scope of the proposed definition of electronic communications media.  Event organisers and primary ticket sellers that sell to a wide general audience advertise widely on broadcast media but secondary ticket sellers confine their advertisements and offers to marketplaces that provide a facility for the sale of tickets and permit ticket resellers to engage directly with prospective purchasers.  The broadcast media covered by the definition of electronic communications media are vehicles for general advertising and do not provide a means whereby secondary ticket sellers can engage individually with prospective buyers.  The definition of secondary ticket marketplace applies already to print publications which provide a facility for the sale or advertising for sale of event tickets.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the amendment to section 17(2) is framed in a way that would prevent it from achieving its aim.  The obligation in section 17(2) to ensure that tickets are not advertised or offered for sale without the ticket seller providing the specified information is on the secondary ticket operator.  Section 2(1) defines \"secondary ticket operator\" as a person who, in the context of a secondary ticket marketplace, owns or manages the marketplace or is otherwise responsible for its operation, as well as a person acting for, or on behalf of, such a person.<\/p><p>As the definition and section 12(2) are worded, the proposed amendment to section 17(2), therefore, would not extend the obligation to ensure that the secondary ticket sellers comply with information requirements of 17(1) to the operators of social media platforms and electronic communications media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021060200002#A00900","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for that clarification.

I will be up all night worrying about it but it is something that is worthy of concern.  As it stands the amendment states that: &quot;It shall be necessary to provide proof that a notice or other document served on or given to a person under subsection (1) has been received by the person concerned&quot;.  The amendment is included therefore as an addition to Section 5 to ensure that where notice has been provided under the section that the person cannot turn around and simply claim that they did not receive the notice.  This is particularly pertinent for paragraphs (b) and (d) whereby the documents could be left at the address of the person concerned or sent by electronic means.  In both cases a situation could possibly arise where the person concerned simply claims that they have not received the documents.  I do not think that anyone, either myself or the Minister of State, want to find ourselves in a situation where we open the pages of a newspaper and we hear that such a person is in effect not covered by the provisions of the legislation because they simply say that they did not receive the documentation.  The intention of this amendment is to tighten that up.

There are a number of reasons I am proposing this amendment.  The Minister of State will know as I do that many events with fewer than 1,000 people in attendance see tickets sold at over the face value and that is an issue.  This is also something in the context of the pandemic that is going to become perhaps a bigger issue in the short term than it might otherwise be because, for a great many venues, their numbers are going to be restricted.  It is restricted numbers which are driving up the prices in many instances.  We know that people are going into the marketplace, purchasing in bulk and then selling on, which is a significant problem.  That is a problem that is exacerbated when bigger venues, even venues that could reasonably accommodate over 1,000 people, for the next while may not be able to accommodate more than 1,000 people.  We need to give some consideration to broadening this definition.<\/p><p>If one takes the trial sporting and music events, five of them have fewer than 1,000 people who will be in attendance.  I understand that for the first few trial events, the tickets are going to be tightly controlled but that is not going to be the case for every event.  As hospitality begins to open up, it is not going to be a matter of clicking one's fingers and being back to February 2020 by any manner or means.  Consideration should be given as this is a long-term issue, but is highly pertinent in the short term, given the restrictions and the likelihood in many of these venues that tickets will be very much sought after.  We are all eager to get back to some kind of normal live entertainment, whatever it is that one wants to be doing, be it sports, music or whatever.  With the current climate and the restrictions in place, this is highly pertinent but it is pertinent in any event and I would welcome hearing the Minister of State's views on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021060200002#B02100","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I genuinely accept where the Deputy is coming from with this amendment and I was of a similar view myself but I will give the Deputy the rationale behind why we cannot accept the amendment and we will see what the Deputy thinks of it.  The first of the conditions for the application for the designation of a venue in section 7(1) states that the venue has the capacity to hold 1,000 persons or more.<\/p><p>The effect of Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment would be to change this condition to \"the venue has the capacity to hold an event or events.\"  When she references Covid-19 restrictions, the capacity of the venue that will count is not the temporary capacity, but the real capacity, so to speak.  When she talks about the 5,000 people who will be allowed into Croke Park, that is not the capacity that will be designated for the purpose of this; it will be the 80,000.  I am sure she is aware of that but I say it for the purposes of clarity.  <\/p><p> The amendment would make a major change to the provisions on the designation of venues in section 7.  While I appreciate that the amendment stems from a constructive desire to strengthen the Bill, I cannot accept it.  <\/p><p> The provisions on the designation of events and venues are a central pillar of the Bill, and the capacity threshold of 1,000 which applies to the designation of venues under section 7(1) is a core element of the venue designation provisions.  The committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny report did not propose a change in this capacity threshold.  A major change of the kind proposed to the provisions on the designation of venues would possibly affect the objective necessity and proportionality of the obligations placed on ticketing businesses by the Bill.  Legal advice would be needed on this point before such an amendment could be considered.  <\/p><p> However, perhaps most importantly the removal of the capacity threshold of 1,000 would require the resubmission of the Bill to the European Commission in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2015\/1535 on the procedure for the provision of information on technical standards and rules on information society services.  The scheme of the Bill was submitted to the European Commission in accordance with this requirement in February 2020 and no issues of compatibility with EU law were raised by the Commission or other member states.<\/p><p> The directive provides, however, that where a proposed national measure is subsequently amended in a way that significantly alters its scope, the measure must be resubmitted for further examination.  Removing the capacity threshold for venue designations would constitute a significant alteration of the scope of the Bill.  If the Bill had to be resubmitted, the result would be that it could not be enacted for a period of at least three months from the date of its notification to the European Commission.  I believe that we all understand and accept the need for the early enactment of this Bill, particularly given that sporting and entertainment events are shortly due to recommence with restricted attendances with all the potential for ticket touting that might present, as the Deputy mentioned.<\/p><p> My Department considers that the capacity threshold of 1,000 which applies to applications for the designation of a venue will cover the great majority of venues that are likely to host the type of high-demand events that can be expected to give rise to appreciable levels of ticket resale.  If a venue with a smaller capacity is due to hold a high-demand event, it will have the option to apply for the designation of the event.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will also have a reserve power under section 7(6) to designate a venue with a capacity of less than 1,000 after consultation with the venue operator.  If it emerges after the Act has been in operation for a time that the capacity threshold of 1,000 is impairing the effectiveness of the Act, it can be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021060200002#B02200","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I welcome the clarification the Minister of State has given.

There is no dispute about that.  Fees are sometimes introduced as a deterrent, which I accept is not the case here, but I am concerned that the inclusion of a fee here might dissuade people.  Section 7(3) provides for the charging of a fee, which, I believe, might act as a deterrent.  I am interested in hearing from the Minister of State what consultation that took place in that regard, how he envisages it will operate and if he believes or not that a fee will act as a deterrent.

Likewise, I take this amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed, but I disagree with it.  The amendment proposes the deletion of section 9(4), which provides that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may prescribe a fee to accompany an application for the designation of an event under section 9(1).  While section 9(4) provides that the Minister &quot;may&quot; provide a fee for the designation of an event, it does not require the Minister to do so.<\/p><p>The Bill has been introduced, in part, following demands from sporting bodies and event promoters that Government take action to tackle ticket touting.  There are means such as personalised and paperless tickets available to promoters and sporting bodies that would make it more difficult for ticket touts to resell tickets for gain.<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>These options involve costs for event organisers.  The enactment of this Bill will result in the cost of tackling ticket touting instead being largely borne by the State.  It is not, in my opinion, unreasonable, therefore, to include a provision under which promoters and sporting bodies who will benefit from the legislation may be required to pay a fee for the designation of their venues or events.  Any such fee would be set by reference to the administrative costs incurred in processing applications for designation and will not be used as a revenue raising measure. <\/p><p>While Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s amendment proposes to delete the provision authorising fees for applications for event designation, it leaves untouched the provision at section 7(3) which permits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prescribe a fee for applications for the designation of a venue.  This is, presumably, because venue designations will cover all events in a venue over a long period of time and are more likely to be applied for by the operators of large venues.  Event designations by contrast will generally apply only to a single time-limited event.  A situation in which fees can be charged for one type of application for designation and not for another is open to question, however, and, depending on the level of the fee, could lead some venue operators to apply for a series of event designations rather than a more permanent venue designation.  <\/p><p>The aspiration and thought-process is that any such fee would be set by reference to the administrative costs incurred in processing the application and this provision will not be used as a revenue raising measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2021060200002#D00200","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the clarification.

There will be an associated cost under this system to the Department.  It is for that reason we are providing for the introduction of a fee to cover the administrative costs.

We found in terms of decisions that could be made that there were a few unusual situations.  The Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Social Protection had the same Minister as did the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment.  At one point it was thought the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment would be merged but in the end they ended up being separate Departments.

What happened at the Department of Health, because of the pandemic and the extremely difficult circumstances, was an acting Secretary General was appointed.  One can see from the note of the meeting in October that the first option under consideration was to ask the acting Secretary General to stay on for an extended period, but in fact that meant perhaps until the summer of this year or until there was some sense of the pandemic coming to an end, which is obviously difficult to predict.  The other option was a transfer and a Top-Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, competition.<\/p> <p>  In short, the man in question moved on the day Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin became Taoiseach and Deputy Harris became Minister at the Department, and thereafter, what we would do about the Department of Health was always an open question.  The acting Secretary General was clear that he was happy to serve for as long as he was asked to serve, and he did so with great distinction.  We knew we would have to make a permanent appointment to that Department at some point.  It was really the pandemic.  There is never a good time to make these big changes and it certainly was not a good time last autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021060200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Fraser"},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The obvious question is why the normal process for open recruitment, which would have happened in the second half of last year, was not initiated at that point.

Also, as Deputy Stanley said, the Secretary General with responsibility for housing, Mr. Fraser himself and other Secretaries General have just the same scale of responsibility.

Ideally, if the issue is there is a question about whether the remuneration package for the senior civil or public servants is not getting the candidates we need, all we can do is have a transparent conversation about that.  The Top-Level Appointments Committee publishes a report every year, I think its latest report will be published in the next couple of weeks, and it goes through the process and its findings.  I am a member of it, so I know the debate.  It occasionally makes glancing remarks about the type of people who apply or how people feel about the job or whether remuneration is an issue or if there are other reasons that people do not apply, all of that debate.

I questioned the then chief commissioner of the OPW as to whether there was a disciplinary process afoot because somebody had made such a mistake, which was the mis-measuring of Miesian Plaza.  Mr. Fraser may recall that.  I was told there was not a disciplinary process.  I put a question at the Committee of Public Accounts to the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I asked him if he was aware of this technical fault and if it was a matter of surprise to him that there was no disciplinary process afoot due to the negligent behaviour that lost the State &euro;10 million over the lifetime of the lease.  I will paraphrase his response, but it is an accurate description of what the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said.  He said we do not employ a \"gotcha\" culture in the Department and mistakes - given the questioning I was putting &ndash; such as the loss of &euro;10 million, was something to be learned from.  It would be a learning experience.  Is this what we can look forward to in the Department of Health?  I refer to the culture of people losing such money from basic banana maths type mistakes that cost the taxpayer &euro;10 million.

In fact, the then Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's first answer at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting, which makes me even more worried, was that he was not even aware that the commissioners in the OPW made such a banana maths basic mistake that lost &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money and ended up being the subject of a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme.  Mr. Fraser is not aware of it.

I can see that I am not going to make any progress here, but I want to make a clear point.  The Civil Service, that has nobody in charge and no head to it, has a culture as defined by a man to whom we are after giving an extra &euro;81,000, who has a retirement package worth in excess of &euro;650,000 and &euro;146,000 every year for the rest of his life.  He stated that it is okay to make mistakes, it is a learning experience and we do not have a \"gotcha\" culture.<\/p> <p>  We keep saying we cannot get talent.  Could I suggest, as my learned colleague and friend, the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, stated earlier, that we might talk to the Brits about how they manage to recruit?  They recruited a head of the NHS.  I take issue with the Chairman, Deputy Stanley, on his figures being slightly wrong but in the same ballpark.  The head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, is paid &euro;242,962.15.  He is responsible for 1.4 million staff and many multiples of the budget of the HSE.  The permanent secretary at the Department of Health in the UK, Chris Wormald, has 2,160 staff, as opposed to our Department of Health, which has approximately 600, and he is paid &euro;214,920.17.

I want to begin from below.  We have spoken about the context of the pandemic.  The decisions are also happening in the context of the end of some of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, the unravelling of FEMPI, the wider issue of the public pay review and the restoration of public pay.  This is a big concern I have, leaving aside some of the very important questions others have asked on the exact stages of the process, who advised whom and to what extent.<\/p> <p>  I have read some of the responses we received from Departments on the building momentum pay agreement.  They speak about how somebody on &euro;25,000 might see a 4% increase over the lifetime of that agreement.  However, we have this role, which is also a public role, for which we are looking at a 40% increase all of our sudden.  I have this concern about what message is being sent.  Mr. Fraser spoke about market sentiment and the factors that might influence those who apply or do not apply.  This is really a question for the Taoiseach about leadership and the Department of the Taoiseach with regard to the message it sends when we have this tiptoeing increase for those on lower incomes.<\/p> <p>  The wages of the secretarial assistants in the Seanad start at &euro;24,000.  They were told previously by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform there is a concern that if the figure were increased, it could send a politically negative message.  We have slow, incremental, tiny increases.  The goal, and the stated policy, has been that the unwinding of FEMPI would begin with those on lower incomes.  This would be the priority and it would send the signal and message we need to send to society.  Does Mr. Fraser see damage to this message when we see this large increase at the same time as we have these small measures?<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that we need appropriate people for roles.  I sat on a committee where the Data Protection Commission spoke about its difficulties in getting appropriate people to do its very important work because of the very rigid rules not at the top level but in the mid-level at which it hires.  These are all people who are staying within the scales of our public service.  Often, they have encountered real difficulties doing what they need to do, even within those scales.  We have seen those at the very bottom of scale getting paltry increases that will creep up and will not even match their rent increases.  Then we see this 40% spike.  Is Mr. Fraser concerned about the message this sends?  Does he see damage not just in the knock-on effect on claims?  We know of this because Mr. Fraser has already cited the CEO of the HSE and the Garda Commissioner as examples.  The very fact he is giving us these examples to justify this tells us there will be a knock-on effect at the top level.  Is he worried about the signal it sends to those on the lower incomes in our public service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021060200002#G03500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622588400,"counter":295,"content":"<p>It was not my decision but that is not to evade my role in the matter.

Mr. Fraser talked about giving advice on why we need to hike the payment for this particular role but he also told us he was not giving his personal advice in respect of implementing a transparent review body on higher remuneration.

The only people who have come before the committee have been the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and Mr. Fraser, for which we are very thankful.  In respect of candidates applying for particular positions involving the TLAC, has Mr. Fraser ever approached somebody and managed his or her appointment through the process?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021060200002#M02600","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622588400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Managed someone's appointment through the process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021060200002#M02700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Fraser"},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021060200002#M02800","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1622588400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021060200002#M02900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Fraser"},{"type":"speech","time":1622588400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Mr. Fraser has not.

No decision is made by TLAC based on whether the person is from the public or private sectors.
