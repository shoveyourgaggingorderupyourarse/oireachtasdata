I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Due to the situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Today we engage with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Department of Health.  This engagement is a continuation of our meeting in February and we will resume our examination of the board's 2019 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the Department of Health: Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary of health infrastructure and Ms Fiona Prendergast, acting director of health infrastructure.  All of the witnesses are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give their evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege.  Today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statement on the board's financial statements in February and it was recirculated to the committee before this meeting.

I thank the committee for inviting the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, today via video link to provide an update on the construction progress on the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am the chief officer at the NPHDB and I am joined this morning by Mr. Phelim Devine, project  director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance manager.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8, and two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Connolly, Blanchardstown, and Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Tallaght.  The national children's hospital project, NCH, a government priority, will have a significant impact on the healthcare outcomes of  25% of the population once completed and is the most significant single capital investment project in the healthcare system ever undertaken in Ireland.  It will bring together the services currently provided at the three children&rsquo;s hospitals into one modern, custom-designed, digital hospital where staff will  deliver the best care and treatments to Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children and young people.<\/p> <p>  The NPHDB&rsquo;s 2019 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 June 2020.  The expenditure as of 31 December 2019 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;199,622,610.  The NPHDB&rsquo;s 2020 accounts are currently being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General  and will be finalised shortly.  We have provided in the statement a brief table showing the 2019, 2020 and cumulative to the end of 2020 expenditure. <\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the construction update.  The new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre, CHI at Connolly was opened in July 2019 and is already fully operational.  On the CHO Tallaght update, it is a priority for the NPHDB and indeed all stakeholders to open the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght in 2021 and we are pleased to report that we are on target to do that.  Members will see from the images distributed as part of the briefing pack that construction work on the 4,600 m2 centre is nearing an end with a substantial completion date scheduled for September 2021.  It will then be handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open for services after an eight-week period of operational commissioning and equipping.  The works at Tallaght are nearing completion.<\/p><p>Final internal works comprise painting, commissioning, cleaning and snagging.  External works comprise final pavements and landscaping.  The work on the OPD centre at Tallaght included a significant investment in the adult hospital which involved the delivery of a new changing and administration block, a new creche and the upgrade of roads, pavements, car park and electrical infrastructure.<\/p><p> Progress on the main new children&rsquo;s hospital is also continuing at pace.  The primary concrete frame was completed in March 2021.  The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame closing in the concourse will be completed by August 2021, as will the unitised glazing to the ward block at levels 4 to 6.  The fa&ccedil;ade will be complete by the end of 2021, with the glazed biome that links the building to be completed by the end of the first quarter of next year.  The fit-out of the south finger rooms, comprising outpatients, cardiology and therapies, and the hot block rooms, comprising emergency department, imaging, critical care and theatres, are progressing well.  The remainder of the fit-out of the north finger rooms, comprising outpatients, the hospital school, third level education, parent overnight accommodation, pharmacy and the ward block rooms, will commence in the next month.  The primary mechanical and electrical plant, comprising boilers, combined heat and power plant, generators, transformers, main distribution boards and medical gases, are well progressed, with the focus now on primary and secondary distribution around the site.<\/p><p> On equipping, some of the group 1 medical equipment, such as theatre and critical care pendants, are currently being installed.  The group 2 equipment, comprising automated guided vehicles and clinical decontamination unit equipment, is in procurement.  The balance of the group 2 equipment, such as MRIs, CTs and other advanced diagnostic equipment, will commence procurement in the next quarter.<\/p><p> Sustainability is embedded in the design of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The hospital very recently received a BREEAM excellent rating in design and is one of only a small number of hospitals in the world to have achieved such a rating.  BREEAM is the world&rsquo;s leading sustainability assessment method for major projects.<\/p><p> On the topic of wider construction sector challenges, the global pandemic, Covid-19, has disrupted the construction sector and all its supply chains both nationally and internationally.  The NCH project has not been immune to this.  In 2020, both the construction of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Tallaght outpatients and urgent care centre were closed for a period following the arrival of Covid in Ireland.  In 2021, the sites remained open during the level 5 lockdown.  The contractor introduced extensive health and safety measures, which include weekly screening and PCR testing for all workers, and more than 5,000 tests were conducted during the month of June.<\/p><p> It is acknowledged by all stakeholders that Covid and Brexit will likely place pressure on the availability of essential supplies in the market globally.  The construction sector is facing challenges related to the supply of market essentials as a result of increased global demand and shortages driven by Covid-related factory shutdowns, production disruption and inventory depletion.  In addition, it is reported that there are Brexit-related import delays and constraints.  This is a global challenge, one that is not unique to the construction sector, but one that will have potential impacts on the project, with cost and lead time uncertainty.  The contractor continues to work through these challenges and will manage the risks.<\/p><p> With regard to the timeline, as outlined to this committee in December 2020, there are delays to the programme of works.  We have previously reported to the committee that we did not have a compliant programme from the contractor.  I am delighted to be able to report to the committee that a compliant programme was submitted by the contractor in March 2021 and has been determined by the employer&rsquo;s representative, ER.  This, in itself, is a major milestone for the project.  With over 40,000 separate activities to be completed over the course of the build, the programme details each and every one, ensuring that it is in the right sequence and at the right phase of the build.  By determining the programme as compliant, the ER has essentially confirmed that it is feasible to complete the construction phase within the timeframe set out.  This is only feasible if the project is executed and resourced efficiently by the contractor and its subcontractors, and if all other external factors, including Brexit and Covid, do not impact on supply issues and goods and services.  The compliant programme takes account of the known delays, and all stakeholders are fully aligned around the goal of opening the hospital in 2024.  The NPHDB and the main contractor are engaged in a series of workshops to map out the detail within the programme to take account of the risks that remain and to make every effort to ensure that the target date can be achieved.<\/p><p> As part of the combined effort to achieve delivery of the programme within the shortest timeframe possible, all dispute mechanisms have been paused for a period of time.  This moratorium has been agreed, which enables the parties to focus all their efforts on ensuring that the new target completion date can be realised.  This does not remove the risk of claims, nor does it mean that we will not continue to receive claims.  Claims will continue to be determined by the employer&rsquo;s representative as set out in the contract.  We have provided an information document as an appendix to this document setting out the current position with contractor claims on the NCH and on Tallaght.<\/p><p> With regard to cost, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the project.  This investment decision excludes items where there was no price certainty, nor can there be certainty for the duration of the project.  These include construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting from healthcare policy changes and also the sectoral employment order.  While we now have a compliant programme, the target completion date for the programme is 14 months later than that set out within the contract.  Any elongation of the programme will lead to additional cost.  There are potential cost implications in regard to Covid-related delays, costs associated with additional health and safety measures, as well as ongoing claims that have the potential to contribute to the overall costs.  These matters, as well as those associated with any change to the programme duration, are currently subject to commercial mechanisms and are part of the live contract that exists between the NPHDB and BAM, the main contractor.  Therefore, I am not in a position to elaborate further at this time as it could compromise our ability to negotiate on behalf of the State.  There is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise our current engagements with the contractor.<\/p><p> On project governance, the NPHDB reports to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on risks to costs and programme, including all aspects of the project.  We also report to the CHP&amp;P board.  We continue to work closely with officials in the Department of Health and the HSE, as well as with colleagues in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the children&rsquo;s hospital is taking shape and the outpatients centre at Tallaght is nearing completion.  Significant progress has been made, as is evident from the photographs and video that we have provided.  The project continues to have challenges.  However, we are moving forward with a spirit of co-operation with the main contractor and with all of our stakeholders to ensure that this badly needed hospital is delivered as soon as possible.  I look forward to answering any questions the committee members might have on the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021071300002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626165000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am director in the health infrastructure division.  I was hoping to be joined by my colleague, Mr. Derek Tierney.  He is having some connectivity issues and, hopefully, he will join us shortly.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the committee has requested a detailed update on the current status.  The Department has previously written to indicate there are commercial sensitivities and elements which are confidential due to the fact there is a live contract in place, and there is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice engagement between the parties and could very likely negatively impact or jeopardise this project.<\/p><p>The children&rsquo;s hospital is the most significant capital investment programme ever undertaken in Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system.  It is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children&rsquo;s hospitals into a modern, custom-designed, world-class digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children.<\/p><p> Despite the obvious challenges the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed on us all, significant progress has been made on the project.  Mr. Gunning and colleagues have spoken to the specifics but the distinctive shape of the building is now clear.  The fit-out of certain internal areas has begun and rooms and clinical areas now discernible.  On a recent site visit, we got a real sense of how welcoming an environment it will be for children, their families and CHI staff, with lots of natural light and break-out spaces in addition to the world class health facilities.<\/p><p> I understand that committee members will be visiting the site tomorrow and will see at first hand the progress on the ground.  It it will become clear to members that this is not just a hospital.  It is effectively a new village to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children, their families and the healthcare professionals who will care for them.  There will be gardens, recreational facilities, a school for the patients and a university campus for future healthcare professionals.<\/p><p> One of most impressive aspects for us is the seemingly endless corridor on the theatre level that will be home to 22 world-class theatres and the respective prep rooms and anterooms.  With the mock-ups of how the various rooms will be completed, there is a tangible sense of the positive clinical care experiences that patients and their families will have in the new hospital.  I hope members will see that the vision for this new hospital is being realised and will garner an appreciation of the scale and complexities of the project, as we did.<\/p><p> The paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown opened in July 2019.  From 4 January to 7 May of this year, approximately 2,500 children presented to the centre at Connolly.  Approximately 96% of children are discharged home after their first visit.  A small number are transferred for further investigation and treatment at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals.  The average amount of time spent by patients in the urgent care centre is 102 minutes.  This is the time it takes from registration to being discharged after being seen and receiving the appropriate treatment from a doctor.  The efficacy of this new facility, despite the challenges of the pandemic, speaks volumes.<\/p><p> The second satellite centre at Tallaght will open before the end of this year.  This opening of the second of the three new campuses will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s health services.<\/p><p> As already stated, the members of the committee also expressed an interest in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the hospital.  The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the Committee of Public Accounts and the interest of members in such matters.  As the committee will be aware, a thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Minister for Health in the summer of 2020 to consider the optimal way forward for the completion of the project.  I must advise that the analysis remains ongoing and the Department continues to work closely with the NPHDB towards its completion.  As this analysis relates to the best way forward on a project that is subject to a live contract, it is commercially sensitive and must remain confidential for an extended period.  A definitive update on costs cannot, therefore, be provided and it would be inappropriate and likely detrimental to the project to speculate on these.<\/p><p> Following the completion of this analysis and submission to the Minister for Health, who commissioned it, an update on the position will be provided to the relevant stakeholders, where appropriate, in light of the commercial sensitivities.  I am pleased to say, however, that the development board is providing an update in relation to the timeline.  In addition to this ongoing analysis, the NPHDB and the main contractor are currently working together to identify possible obstacles to the timely completion of the project.  To allow this process to continue unencumbered and without distraction, both parties have agreed to a period of moratorium on claims.  This ongoing moratorium applies to conciliations, adjudications and High Court proceedings.  This will allow both parties to dedicate all their energies towards delivering the project as quickly as possible and is very much welcomed by the Department.<\/p><p> While there is demonstrable progress, there are also challenges associated with the project.  Many of these are not specific to this project, however.  We are still in the midst of a global pandemic.  While work on NCH sites continued through the lockdown earlier this year, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is advising that we should expect a significant wave of Delta variant transmission and we must anticipate the many challenges this pandemic will continue to present.  Indeed, the wider construction industry is challenged by supply chain issues and dramatic price increases.  This was reflected in the recent national economic dialogue where it was noted that the pandemic and Brexit are impacting the economy and productivity and creating bottlenecks in the context of supply.  These challenges face the children&rsquo;s hospital project too, and notwithstanding the commercial sensitivities, makes speculation and definitive forecasting of costs and timelines even more unwise.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, reflecting the positives, we now have paediatric outpatient and urgent care being delivered at Connolly, a site at St. James's that is progressing well, with constructive engagement between the development board and its main contractor, and a new paediatric outpatients&rsquo; facility at Tallaght University Hospital is coming online later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021071300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Prendergast","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626165000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The lead speaker today was to be Deputy Hourigan but she is absent.

We all want to see a national children's hospital built, completed and fully operational as soon as possible.  During our last engagement, we heard about the number of claims that were potentially outstanding.  As other speakers noted, it is extremely regrettable and very worrying that we cannot get a handle on the cost.  We are here on behalf of the public to establish the costs to, and potential exposure of, the public purse in respect of this project.  For the witnesses to come here this morning and say they cannot estimate that cost, or will not do so out of fear of litigation, is worrying from our perspective and will be worrying for the public.  That is not to take away from the importance and strategic nature of the children's hospital.  I look forward to visiting the site again.  I was there before when I was on the HSE's regional health forum prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to seeing the progress made on site.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  Colleagues have asked about claims.  I refer to the report of this committee in 2019 arising out of its engagement with the witnesses.  Recommendation No. 1 stood out for me.  It notes: &quot;The Committee finds it absolutely unacceptable that nobody can give a reasonably accurate estimate of the expected final costs for the completion and fitting out of the National Children's Hospital.&quot;  Two years later, we are still none the wiser and that is why I am so worried.  It is really concerning that, two years on and given the delays that have occurred, both the witnesses from the board and the Department still cannot estimate the cost.

It is that kind of resource level, or above, which is required to deliver completion of the hospital in December 2023.  We are hoping and becoming more confident that the resources are increasing and going in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Gunning outlined regarding completion in 2023, when we hand over the hospital to Children's Health Ireland, the technical commissioning of all the mechanical and electrical, M&amp;E, systems will be completed in the hospital.  An operational phase then follows, which will be undertaken by Children's Health Ireland.  It includes putting in the equipment - which we will assist them with - cleaning the hospital and familiarisation.  Some 2,500 to 3,000 staff must become familiar with the hospital before it can go live.  Therefore, a serious amount of detailed planning is going on now regarding that exercise.

It has been stated that there is ongoing analysis, presented by Mr. Gunning to Ms Prendergast, where updates are provided based on the challenges coming in, the expected costs and the liability that may go a certain way if those costs come in or not.  There is a stream of documentation between Mr. Gunning and Ms Prendergast in this regard.  If representatives of this committee went to the Department of Health in a private context, and if these documents were to remain private and not to be leaked in some fashion, I wonder if would we get to see this documentation, analysis and accountability throughout.

What I do not want to see in two or three years, though, is that the way in which this process has been handled, possibly because of pressure from this committee - but which I hope Mr. Gunning will resist - resulting in an increase in costs because of a failure to have offered an appropriate defence in this regard.

Is this a reasonable statement to make?  Effectively, the main contractor is the postbox used for any subcontracting increases or variations.  The witnesses explained what a variation or claim is.

He referred to expenditure until 31 December 2019.  He gave us a statement and said by way of example that at the end of December 2019 the contractor had progressed 8.5% of the work by value when it should have been progressed by 22%.  The contractor is responsible.  The delay continued to grow month by month.  The contractor is responsible for some of the delays by virtue of not having sufficient staff on site.  This was prior to the pandemic.  It was part of the contract.  The longer this goes on the more likely it is to accrue construction inflation or add it to the ultimate cost.<\/p> <p>  We also see the site was shut down for seven weeks due to the pandemic but the contractor did not come back for 15 weeks.  I presume the staff were paid a wage subsidy or a pandemic unemployment payment in that time so there was a double cost.

The issue we were concerned with was the timeline because we want to see the hospital built, like everybody else.  As public representatives, we are acutely aware of that right across the political spectrum.  There is obviously the issue of costs as well.  Subsequently, as Mr. Gunning will recall, that engagement was delayed because the report was not ready.  We met on 9 February and we were promised on that date that we would have that in the month of March.  We are now into the second half of July, the second half of 2021.  Although Mr. Gunning cannot speak for the Taoiseach, he will recall that the Taoiseach said that the national children's hospital project would be built by 2020.  However, we learned today that the board and the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are aware of where the landing point is in terms of price.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we are accountable to the public and to the taxpayer, who will see at the bottom of their wage packets this week deductions for PRSI, PAYE and various other deductions, and it is similar for self-employed people and small businesses across the country, yet we are not able to extract answers.

All members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to please mute their microphone when not making a contribution and to please use the raise hand function to indicate.  Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots are prioritised for members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The first session is engagement with Irish Racehorse Trainers Association, IRTA.  The topic for today's meeting is alleged issues in the horse racing industry with representatives of the IRTA, followed by representatives of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB.  I acknowledge once more that this series of meetings was called on foot of recent allegations made in the media.  In order to give all parties a fair hearing, the person who made those statements was invited to appear before the joint committee, but has chosen to decline the invitation.  Although such an engagement would have been beneficial to our discussion on what is a important issue for a significant Irish industry it is their right not to participate and they are not answerable to the committee.  It must be said that we are not a committee of inquiry, so we are not here to judge the veracity of statements made or explore any allegations or wrongdoing against any person.  Our only objective is to establish what systems and processes are in place to see if they are up to international standards and to discuss any policy issues arising.  I remind witnesses and members I will not allow criticism of anyone and in particular anyone who is not here to defend themselves.  I also remind them of the parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p>  From the IRTA I welcome Mr. Michael Halford, chairperson, and Mr. Michael Grassick, chief executive officer.  Both are joining us remotely.  We have received their opening statement and it has already been circulated to members.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.  The IRTA representatives have ten minutes to make an opening statement before we move to questions and answers.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I must give an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants in the committee meeting who are in locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which participation is covered by the absolute privilege of a statutory nature.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. Halford to make his opening statement on behalf of the IRTA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071300002#A00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Good afternoon everyone.  I will read out our statement.  On behalf of the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association I thank the members of the Oireachtas joint committee for their invitation to express the views of our association and to represent our members in relation to equine anti-doping in Irish racing.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Racehorse Trainers Association, founded in 1950, is the official representative body of Irish racehorse trainers and is an inclusive, all-Ireland, 32-county association.  Our headquarters are located at the Racing Academy and Centre of Education in Kildare.  The association has played a major role in the progress of Irish racing since its inception and has set up excellent communication procedures with all concerned in the administration and running of the Irish racing industry.<\/p> <p>  In my position as Chairman of the IRTA I can honestly say that apart from well-publicised recent claims imparted from one trainer I have never received any reports on doping in Irish racing.  I am disappointed and upset that the good name and reputation of Irish horse racing and its world-renowned trainers is being maligned in this way.  In Ireland we are world leaders in our sport and this is something that we are proud of.  Many Irish trainers have competed at the highest level all around the world and as such have their horses regularly and routinely tested.  These tests take place both pre-race and post-race in all the leading racing jurisdictions.  All tests have proved negative to all banned substances.  This is a record all Irish trainers are very proud of.<\/p> <p>  Over the last few years the IHRB veterinary team has been strengthened considerably with the appointment of Dr. Lynn Hillyer as head of anti-doping.  On race days when horses arrive at the racetrack they are met by the IHRB veterinary team.  Horses are then inspected and identified by their passports and microchip number.  After each race the winner is subjected to a blood or urine sample and on some occasions a hair sample is taken.  Horses that run poorly are also subject to sampling.  The results of these tests are generally known within 14 days.  If there are any adverse findings the trainer is notified and an investigation by the IHRB follows.  The IHRB now has the status of authorised officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which means all horses of all ages can be tested on stud farms, point-to-point meetings, pre-training yards, schooling days at racecourses and also sales complexes.  At these premises blood and urine samples are taken along with hair samples which can detect the presence of steroids in all stock from a very young age.  All training yards are also subject to random unannounced inspections, where blood, urine and hair samples can be taken.  Never has the anti-doping system led to such frequent and thorough testing, yet nothing untoward has been found to suggest that racehorses are receiving anything except all that is permitted and necessary for the welfare and well-being of the horse.<\/p> <p>  We firmly welcome the considerable improvements and modernisations of the anti-doping system.  It is often forgotten that trainers are breeders and owners of horses too, and a huge number of horses-in-training are traded from Ireland all over the world.  The good reputation of Irish racing is a key component in this trade.  For many trainers this trading element of their business is the difference between a successful year in which they can find the investment to improve their premises and increase the amount of people they employ, or not.  Thus it is in the best interests of Irish trainers that there is an anti-doping system that is modern and thorough.<\/p> <p>  The integrity of the Irish horse racing industry depends on a vigilant and transparent regulatory body to maintain and secure into the future our world-renowned reputation.  If there is any doping in horse racing then we at the IRTA would utterly condemn such practices and back any measures taken to combat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Halford"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Halford.

We have had this in debates on fisheries where a number of members have been substituted so just to make it clear, once a person is substituted and I, as Chairman, am notified before the start of the meeting he or she is treated as a full member for that particular meeting.<\/p> <p>  I have five members indicating to speak and I will take them in the order they appear to me on the screen.

The only way we can work this out is with the co-operation of the IHRB.  This is just rumours and innuendo, and if people keep repeating it, there is not much we can do.  We work with HRI and the IHRB.  As I said, more testing has been done in the past couple of months than has ever been done.  I do not know what else we can do to prove what is or is not going on.  Medication takes place daily at yards.  There is a medical register for all drugs that are used.  When I say \"drugs\", I mean medication.  There are two words.  The minute the word \"drugs\" is used, it is considered a bad word, whereas in fact the drugs are medication these horses are on for their training.  Before they can race, those drugs must have left their systems, which can take some time.  If the drugs are found in the horse's system when it wins a race, it is disqualified.  It is as simple as that.  Sometimes there is a delay in the drug going out of the horse's system.  As I said, there are a couple of cases coming along.  From what I can gather, they are all instances in which the drug had not left the horse's system when he raced.  Different drugs take different amounts of time to leave the system.  There is a drug that is not so much a drug but rather an injection for the joints.  When horses get older, they suffer from wear and tear.  Sometimes that drug does not leave the joints.  It might have a ten-day timeframe for leaving the system.  I know of cases in which horses were given a ten-day timeframe but that drug was still found in the horse months later, and that was with testing by the IHRB monthly until that horse's system was cleared.  I do not know what more the trainers can do.  The IHRB is doing as much as is humanly possible.

For the people who do not understand, as trainers we have a duty of care to these horses and their well-being.  If we have a horse that is lame, our first thing to do is to get the vet.  When we get the vet, he or she comes out and assesses the horse.  If the horse needs medication or whatever else, the horse is treated by the vet, not by us.  We have a medical register for the vets in our office.  They fill in exactly what the horse got, when it got it, the amounts it got and the withdrawal time the drug should take to leave the horse's system so it will be clear to run.  I have a board in front of me in the office and all horses that are on any medication are written on the board along with the withdrawal days.  We have a list of what the withdrawal days should be.  As Mr. Grassick said, it may not be 100% perfect in that sometimes something could stay in a horse's system a little longer.  In that case I always give a horse longer than is recommended.  That is the way it works.  Likewise, any drugs or whatever we may have in the yard or anything we need to treat the horses with is all prescription now.  We get prescriptions with the horse's name, the dosage and the number of days on them.  They are all kept in a file, so when or if the IHRB decides to carry out an inspection in our yard, it will come to the office.  The first thing we do with every horse when we get its passport is we take it out of the food chain.  We sign it off to say it is not eligible for the food chain.  Then there is a medical record for every horse.  As I said, the prescriptions are all kept and the medicine is all kept under lock and key.  We have one guy, a qualified chemist from Croatia, who is in charge of the medicines.  Every morning he goes to his locker, which is under lock and key, and deals with all the horses, so there is no confusion about whose responsibility it is.  There is one guy dedicated to this, and a record of everything is strictly kept in the office.  Being trainers, we signed up for this with the IHRB, which has access to our yard 24-7.  Its staff can call whenever they wish, look for all this stuff and cross-reference it back to the vets.  It is all above board and all there to be seen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021071300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Halford"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I welcome the guests.

Only one or two horses in each race were pre-race tested.  Some of those horses got upset because the test involves the taking of blood.  A lot of horses are highly strung animals.

Since the authorised officers came in, seemingly a number of those people who did the previous tests did not want to take up the position of authorised officer because they felt it was a conflict with themselves.  Knowing their day-to-day work with the trainers, they did not want to be involved in that sort of a situation.  They said they had to work with them under normal circumstances and they did not want to be going into yards with the authorised officer's status.  All I know is there are 12 authorised officers.

A number of points were made during the previous session with the IRTA and it is important that I clarify the record as there seems to be a misunderstanding to the effect that we are not accountable.  We are accountable to six different organisations.  Financially, we are accountable to HRI and there is full transparency.  We prepare a budget on a line-by-line basis each year in October-November that goes to the HRI board.  We have discussions with the HRI executives before it goes to the board.  We agree a figure and it gets approved.  We account on a monthly basis for everything we spend and, on a quarterly basis, there is an in-depth review with HRI of all the variances.  As I stated last week, we cannot reallocate money that was given to be spent in one area on another area.  That is the first area where we are accountable and transparent.<\/p> <p>  Second, the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out a full audit of the IHRB and goes through everything to ensure we comply with public procurement processes and our own internal policies.  Third, we are accountable to all Oireachtas committees.  That is enshrined in legislation in the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  We are accountable to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Committee of Public Accounts.  We are also accountable to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we regularly get parliamentary questions where we have to give information to the Minister on specific issues.  We are fully transparent, and anybody can ask us any question regarding our activities and we would be quite happy to deal with it.  We have nothing to hide.

I thank Mr. Egan.  The inference was in response to questions from Senator Mullen that there has been a dramatic increase in testing and inspections in the past couple of months.

I mentioned last week that our out-of-competition testing has improved or increased from approximately 9% in 2016 to 18% in 2019 and is now up at 28%.  That did not happen in the last two months.  We did not wake up two months ago and begin testing.  It has been a gradual, incremental and quite dramatic increase over the last two, three and four years.<\/p> <p>  The reason we have increased our out-of-competition testing is because that is where we need to focus our efforts.  Any modern anti-doping programme does that.  There has been an increase in June; there is no doubt about that.  That was entirely coincidental with the issue of our authorised officer warrant cards.  We had a little bit of ground to make up due to Covid-related absences on yards earlier in the year.  I think I explained that last year and the Deputy can see from our statistics.  It has, therefore, increased.  We will be increasing it.  Again, as I explained last week, it is not all about numbers.

The simple reason is that Dr. Hillyer and any of the authorised officers are at a big disadvantage when they go out.

The skill sets we have within officials in racing are varied.<\/p><p>There are some who, perhaps, have not gone into tertiary level education, some have come straight from school and some have gone all the way and have PhDs.  It just depends.  What they all have in common is that they are expert horse people and they understand racing.  They know how to work around horses and understand racing and racing people.  Perhaps more importantly, they understand what we are trying to achieve.<\/p><p> When we looked at how to structure our recruitment, training and assessment for the authorised officer team, we looked at the skills required to do the authorised work effectively, correctly and fully.  We took advice from the existing authorised officer team within the Department.  We looked at where they came from and their backgrounds and we acted accordingly.  To cut a long story short in the interests of time - and I am happy to talk about it in depth on another occasion - we invited applications of interest from our team.  We invited applicants to a preliminary session hosted by the Department at which there was a run-through of what the authorised officer piece would involve, including the responsibilities and accountability involved and the skill sets required.  We laid it on the line quite strongly as to what was involved because we did not want people to be going in with anything other than their eyes open.  We then had a very rigorous interview and selection process, which resulted in the 12 officers being interviewed, assessed and followed through on.<\/p><p> The training has been based on material provided by the Department.  As you would expect, it is material about the legislation itself.  It is material concerning how they conduct their business as authorised officers.  It is material relating to ongoing assessment.  I should point out that we have a consultant from the Department on a permanent retainer, as it were, to act as mentor for the team.  We are in constant dialogue and contact with the Department about the work we have done so far, seeking feedback and assessment.  What I am trying to say is that a lot of thought has been given to this.  I am from a teaching and training background.  I have taught students from different backgrounds and of varying abilities.  It is something that is very important to me.  It was particularly important for the organisation that when we embarked upon this and took on this responsibility, it was handled and taken seriously.<\/p><p> The book is still open.  There is a draft training manual and we are still adding to it.  We will take time this year to review our activity in conjunction with the Department in order to ensure that we have a complete document.

When we spoke with representatives from the IRTA earlier, they told us that in discussions with the IHRB in November, it was agreed that pre-race testing would be for all horses and that horses would not be singled out, because the trainers felt that it would be unfair to the horses that were tested.  It seems to be a fair and equitable approach.  I am wondering why, if that was agreed in November, it is eight months and heading towards a year later and it has not been implemented.  In terms of the public perception of racing at the moment, the best piece of work that the IHRB could do is to implement that immediately.

The first are trainers who are based on the Curragh and train their horses there all year round and the fees per horse are collected through the HRI client account system.  The second are trainers who do not base themselves on the Curragh but come and use the gallops on a <i>per diem <\/i>basis.  They bring horses to work because of the variety of gallops.  Their fees are also collected on the basis of dockets and information that is returned by the trainer when he or she uses the gallops and processed as a charge on the trainer's account through HRI.

It will not be an inconvenience.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses who are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  <\/p> <p>  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  For those who are watching this meeting online, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everybody to bear with us should any technical issues arise.

I am adviser on energy, technology and environmental sustainability at the International Transport Forum, which I joined in 2019.   Prior to this, I worked for the International Energy Agency, United Nations, European Commission and the environment directorate of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  The ITF is a global transport policy think tank with 63 member countries that span the world and are not limited to OECD members.  We are grateful for our co-operation with our member country, Ireland, who has held ITF's presidency in 2020 and 2021.<\/p> <p>  I was invited to focus on the subject of electric vehicles.  I understand that the main aim of the committee is to ascertain how Ireland can achieve emission reduction targets and other desirable outcomes.  I will build on a number of publications that were published by the ITF and the International Energy Agency and, in particular, those on which I had the privilege to lead.<\/p> <p>  The first point I wish to make is that I see electric mobility as a key pillar of transport decarbonisation but not as the unique solution or silver bullet.  It is important to bear in mind that deep cuts in emissions will require measures beyond the electrification of vehicles into the space of what are typically called \"avoid and shift\" measures.  Additional action also needs to be taken throughout the life cycle of all emissions of vehicles, including in manufacturing, energy production and distribution, infrastructure construction and operational services.  That is another key point to bear in mind when looking to what can be done through EVs and beyond.<\/p> <p>  The transition to EVs should also be seen in the broader context of other megatrends that can have positive impacts on economic productivity, in particular, digitalisation and the falling costs of renewable energy.  It is something that helps make the case for the transition to electric mobility and electric vehicles.  Further to this, it is also important to look at the context of policies and market developments that are geared towards the promotion of innovation and the fact that they have been key determinants in strong developments in cost cuts in the past decade for emerging low-carbon technologies.  It is clearly the case in respect of batteries, which are key components of EVs, but also for other technologies that are essentially related to the renewable energy space such as wind and solar-generated electricity.  These developments have had major impacts and have caused shifts in the capital markets and have led to the increase in market capitalisation of specific automakers and energy companies that excel in the electric mobility and renewable energy space.  My impression is that Covid-19 has further accelerated these processes, as many Governments have been putting in place stimuli aiming to drive a recovery subject to lower financial, climate and sustainability risks.  <\/p> <p>  Electric and digital technologies allowed new actors to enter the transport vehicle, service and energy markets.  It is related to the shift in capital observed in the capital markets.  I will not name companies individually but I am sure all members are aware of different companies whose market value has been rising significantly in recent years.  Many of them operate in the EV and renewable energy spaces.  From all of that, I expect to see an acceleration of both policy action and private sector investment in the space of clean, connected and autonomous vehicles, including EVs.  As connected and autonomous vehicles are likely to increase travel demand, it will be important for Governments interested in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to look at ways to manage those impacts.  It is important for some of the recommendations I will outline later.  I will return to the point then.<\/p> <p>  In the near term, policy support is still required to get EVs and, in particular, cleaner vehicles more generally, into the market.<\/p><p>This will require a clear vision and the establishment of technical standards and regulations to ensure the safe operation of these vehicles.  It also requires a conducive energy taxation and pricing framework.  Ambitious public procurement programmes can also help to get the first electric vehicles on the roads or to scale up the number of vehicles already on the road.  Economic incentives have been widely used to orient consumer preferences towards electric vehicles.<\/p><p> Tomorrow, major announcements will be made about regulatory requirements by the European Commission.  These are also important to make sure there is greater market penetration.  Given the impact of the change in the energy mix, there will also need to be policies to address aspects related to networks for the distribution of low carbon energy, in particular electricity and the deployment of charging infrastructure in the case of electric vehicles.<\/p><p> My take on this is that a transition to direct electrification of vehicles and renewable energy is likely to be the best fit for the cost transition towards low-carbon transportation of all the vehicles and fuel technologies we have available.  However, there will be a bridging phase in which the cost will need to be reduced.  The regulatory framework also needs to allow electric vehicles to stabilise the electricity network and capitalise on digital technology to better align demand and supply.  There are challenges with regard to resource efficiency and sustainable supply chains that will need to be properly addressed through regulatory frameworks and other policy solutions.  I am happy to go into greater detail on them.<\/p><p> We also believe governments should prepare for a transition from fuel duties to road pricing.  By the time many electric vehicles will be on the road there will be less government revenue available from fuel taxation and there will still be a need to pay for the infrastructure.  It will be important to ensure there is a mechanism to allow them to raise funds to continue to pay for road transport infrastructure.  The ITF has been advocating for the development of distance-based charging.  This requires a number of regulatory developments to enable it.  As I mentioned earlier, these are also important to manage the transition towards digital and autonomous vehicles, which will also have an impact on activity and demand.  Covid-19 packages can support the roll-out of charging infrastructure but it will be important to make sure public spending is addressed to areas where private investment would not be able to cover transitional changes.  This would be where it is harder for private investment to ensure the availability of chargers.<\/p><p> Governments should also prepare for the impact the sustainable mobility transition to EVs and renewables will have on jobs, skill sets and social equity.  This is important.  I also want to stress the importance of ensuring that as countries transition towards e-mobility, they are also able to grasp part of the value chain that comes with it.  It will be possible for their economies to benefit from the transition.  This is the same story for a transition to renewable energy.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>I am an associate professor at the centre for transport research at Trinity College Dublin.  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to speak to them again about transportation and emissions.  I congratulate the committee on the fantastic report it published last month on this topic.<br\/><br\/>Before discussing EVs, there are some fundamental issues to consider regarding private vehicles in general regardless of how they are fuelled.  They take up a large amount of space in the built environmental with roads and parking.  They spend approximately 95% of their time parked.  Cars cause congestion, as we all know.  In 2017, it was estimated this could cost up to &euro;2.08 billion in 2033 in the greater Dublin area.  Cars also cause air quality issues, particularly regarding particulate matter and particularly EVs because they are heavier.  Policies that promote EVs should consider a number of important factors to ensure the viability of investment and its impact.<br\/><br\/>A just transition as well as cost are key in electric vehicle policymaking.  Research that we have conducted in TCD shows that the highest concentrations of electric vehicle ownership tend to be in the most affluent areas in Ireland.  As Mr. Cazzola has mentioned, the charging network required for these in Ireland will be extensive.  In our urban areas there is a challenge of where to put charging spaces.  The data on the number of households with driveways for parking is poor.  In 2017, a household survey in Dublin found that just 44% had a driveway.  I am involved in research in the Terrain-AI3 project funded by Science Foundation Ireland and Microsoft.  We are using aerial imagery to find driveways and using machine learning to count them and get more accurate data.  This is important because driveways are the most efficient place to charge vehicles.<br\/><br\/>In 2019, the average price of the top three selling EVs was &euro;32,500.  The average price of the top three selling EVs in the first six months of this year was &euro;43,000.  All of these prices exclude the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants.  This shows our tastes are changing but so too is the average price Irish customers are choosing to pay.  The debate on when the price of electric vehicles will reach parity with non-electric vehicles is varied.  Industry commentators and academics provide strong arguments for both sides.  However, the timeline for when parity is likely to happen is unclear.  As such, any policy depending or based on parity needs to be afforded some level of risk.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has ambitious EV targets but so do many other countries in Europe and around the world.  Ireland will be competing for the supply of these vehicles and supply issues may impact our ability to reach goals and fulfil our ambition.  Government subvention in this market works and many examples from around the world show that when they are taken away the demand falls.  Countries such as Norway provide extensive monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage this transition.  Research conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the current incentives show a benefit-cost ratio of replacing a petrol car with an electric vehicle of 0.1444.<br\/><br\/>The carbon projections for Ireland in the transport field are clear.  We need to throw the kitchen sink at the issue to meet the 51% carbon reduction.  We need to be clever in how we spend available incentives for EVs to make sure we get the greatest carbon reductions.  Some of the following policies need to be considered.  The second-hand EV car market needs incentives to ensure it is healthy.  This will help to reduce the cost of these vehicles and assist in a just transition.  Of the used cars for sale this morning on <i>carzone.ie<\/i>, only 3% are electric.  As previously stated, cars spend 95% of their time parked.  My research shows that shared cars have the potential to reduce car ownership and encourage a greater use of non-car modes.  A national pilot for shared electric vehicles should be considered.  Research conducted by the ITF on Dublin shows that shared options have the ability to yield significant benefits.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has more than 21,000 taxis.  Incentives to electrify this fleet to date have been unsuccessful.  This is a large fleet that could be converted with greater engagement with the industry.  We need to look at the promotion of electric bicycles.  These are also electric vehicles.  Their ability to decarbonise and decongest our cities and urban areas is an important element we need to examine.  Rural Ireland has a number or areas experiencing transport disadvantage.  These areas also have high emissions, which are primarily caused by the distances that have to be travelled.  Electric vehicles may be the most effective way to decarbonise these areas.  Targeted incentives need to be considered.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for its invitation to speak.

I echo the congratulations to the committee for its report on transport emissions last month.<\/p> <p>  I am a lecturer in energy systems modelling in University College Cork, UCC, and I lead research and model development within the MaREI Centre.  Most recently, I have been leading the development of the new TIMES-Ireland energy systems model, funded by the Department, and supporting the Climate Change Advisory Council on carbon budget deliberations.  I also have expertise in transport energy modelling and was a former colleague of Mr. Cazzola at the International Energy Agency.<\/p> <p>  Our modelling points to how challenging meeting the target of halving greenhouse gases by 2030 will be.  With business-as-usual energy demands, and without breakthrough technologies, we will see marginal abatement costs of well over &euro;1,000 per tonne by 2030.  That means every sector will need to push for maximum feasible abatement or throwing the kitchen sink at the problem, as my colleague said.  Incremental changes will not be enough to meet the target.  It is likely that the transport sector will be required to reduce emissions faster than others.  Depending on our assumptions of technology availability, the evolution of demands and efforts across other sectors, in particular agriculture, which is the other main emitting sector, our TIMES model sees transport emissions falling by between 45% and 65% by 2030.  To succeed in that regard, it is likely that meeting the target of nearly 1 million EVs on our road by 2030 is necessary but, at the same time, that will be insufficient to meet the goal.  The point is not that there is a choice between EVs or active travel.  We need to use all of those means.<\/p> <p>  This point is reinforced by the recently published Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, emissions projections, which show that the measures in the 2019 climate action plan, including the 1 million EV target, will only see emissions from transport reduced by a quarter, as growth in activity, meaning people driving more, offsets the emissions savings from the measures.  We have witnessed that in the past.  It is clear that technology and fuel switches alone will not be sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement targets and could make energy more expensive, less reliable, and potentially require us to rely on imported biofuels in the near term, and negative emissions options like biomass with carbon capture and storage in the longer term.  These are all problematic and could lead to unintended consequences.<\/p> <p>  The mitigation effort in transport is mainly framed around the number of EVs in 2030.  That is problematic.  It is like me planning to lose weight based on how much salad I will eat next year when the real effort should be on reducing the volume of junk food I am eating.  In the transport sector, we should focus all efforts on reducing the number of cars, vans and trucks burning petrol and diesel, and minimising their use.  Electrification is an important way of achieving that goal but it is by no means sufficient or optimal in all cases.  We need to remember that oil use in transport needs to halve and go back to the level consumed in 1994 in less than ten years.<\/p> <p>  To achieve that, we need not just to focus on maximising the sale of EVs, we need to immediately minimise the number of new internal combustion engine vehicles brought into the country.  That includes hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles.  Our modelling sees little role for those cars, going forward.  That also includes second-hand vehicles.  Every car and van that uses petrol or diesel that is brought into this country from now will cause significant emissions well into our third carbon budget period.<\/p> <p>  It is concerning that sports utility vehicles, SUVs, comprise half of new car sales, up from 13% a decade ago.  SUV sales far outstrip those of EVs.  If we delay new car sales by a number of years until EVs have come down in price and charging infrastructure has improved, it will put us in a much better position.  Focussing on EVs alone also fails to tackle strong growth in emissions from freight transport, which is a sector we do not hear enough about.  Biofuels will also be needed.  As far as possible, those biofuels, which will be needed to meet our 2030 target, should be produced domestically using strict sustainability practices, rewarding farmers who switch from livestock production.  There are strong win-wins in that scenario.<\/p> <p>  We need to reduce the activity levels of cars, vans and trucks.  In UCC, we are also developing models to understand how and why we travel.  For example, included in my submission to the committee is a suggestion that more than one fifth of passenger transport emissions are from so-called companion journeys, nearly as much as for commuting.  Much of that is for the school run.  In 1986, less than a quarter of primary school students travelled to school by car.  That share is now 60% and increasing.  For secondary students, the share has increased from 11% to 42%.  Only 2% of secondary school students now cycle to school.  In 1986, more students cycled than went to school by car.  This is not a surprise.  The number of cars on the road has tripled since 1990, leaving much less space for people.  We have devoted much of our public realm to vehicles to the extent that it is hostile to people, especially children.  For example, many of my local primary schools do not even have footpaths leading to them and it is difficult to navigate those that have footpaths when one is pushing a pram and holding the hand of a toddler.  This situation was not inevitable and is a failure of policy and planning.<\/p> <p>  In our research, we have also found that nearly 40% of passenger transport emissions arise from trips shorter than 8 km, a distance that can be comfortably cycled by most people, especially with an ebike.  EVs will have the greatest value if they replace longer distance trips, especially trips which cannot be easily switched to bus or rail.<\/p> <p>  Another motivation for tackling and improving efficiency is the fact that if we do not, we may put immense pressure on the electricity grid.  The growth in renewables may not be able to keep up with demand growth.  Our modelling suggests that combining already strong business-as-usual energy demand growth with data centre demand and the electrification of transport could lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2030.  That means that efficiency is still a critically important decarbonising measure even in EVs.  Smaller and more efficient EVs are better than large ones.  That insight applies to all sources of electricity growth.<\/p> <p>  To look at alternatives to this business-as-usual scenario, we have modelled a new low-energy demand scenario pathway, which includes avoid and shift-type measures for all sectors.  Our analysis is clear that the transition to 2030 will be far more feasible with lower energy demands.  It brings down those marginal abatement costs to less hair-raising levels.<\/p> <p>  I call for more transparency behind the analysis underpinning national climate mitigation targets.  In UCC, we have been opening up our models, making them open source and open data to great benefit.  There is an expression in the community that all models are wrong but some are useful.  The models are not crystal balls; they are only a product of who is using them and how they are being used.  Stakeholders and society can only reach consensus on the best way forward if we start from a common understanding of data and assumptions.

He mentioned that consideration is being given to, and discussions are taking place on, a distance-based charge.  Could he give an update in that regard?  I presume many countries are facing a challenge to move away from an emissions-based tax system.  I note the ITF's report on delivery vehicles.  That is an issue that comes up regularly.

There are smartphone apps.  It brings things we have in smart cities into rural areas.  They can pre-book trips, etc.  There is a great example from Donegal, which is Local Link Donegal.  They partnered with Toyota.  They use plug-in hybrid vehicles to bring people to medical appointments.  There are ways to do this.<\/p> <p>  The definition of transport is advantage.  I submitted a map as part of my opening statement.  These areas do not have alternatives to cars.  They have high levels of car ownership.  They are also defined as \"deprived areas\" on the basis of the Pobal HP deprivation index.  I frame my answer to the second question around captive fleets.  I mentioned taxis, of which there are 21,000 in Ireland.  Any of those captive fleets that you can hit all at once is where the low-hanging fruit is in the context of policymaking.

The car tax based on emissions, as far as I understand it, is a system that applies at the moment of registration.  That is one of the systems that can be used to stimulate transition towards vehicles with better environmental performance.  The concept of distance-based charges is complementary.  In a way, car owners also pay taxes once they run on roads because they consume fuels that are subject to excise taxes and VAT.  Those excise taxes are collected during vehicle operation.  The moment we switch towards EVs, those taxes will no longer become part of the Government budget.  If there is a progressive shift to EVs, there will be a progressive decline in Government revenues from fuel taxation.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to address that shortfall in Government revenues.  Distance-based charges, which are essentially applied to vehicles during operation and not at the registration, could be one way to bridge the gap.  There are a number of regulatory developments that need to happen to ensure that this can actually take place.  Some of them relate to the development of digital or connected legal regulations.  This big cost could potentially involve paying according to different levels of congestion.  This is important in the context of a transition towards a greater role of automation.  This used to be a longer-term objective, but it is not so long-term in nature any more.  I want to flag that there are tax-related challenges that need to be anticipated and dealt with in advance.  It will be important to look into this problem and not to waiting another five or ten years before figuring out what to do about it.  As stated, it is unrelated to the differentiated taxation at registration.  Rather, it is related to fuel taxation and Government revenue shortfalls that may come in the longer term.  I hope this clarifies things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":710,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Cazzola say a quick word on the opportunities relating to the electrification of delivery vehicles?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#D00500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":711,"content":"<p>I apologise for leaving that question aside.  We released a report in December of last year on delivery vehicles.  Such vehicles have predictable uses and are often part of fleets.  They are often used for urban deliveries.  Similar to taxis, they are vehicles with certain emissions profiles.  They are the subject of high daily use which is also predictable daily use.  They are a category of vehicles that should be prioritised for transition towards electric, given the lower operational costs of electric vehicles.  As well as this, there are opportunities for these vehicles to pay for themselves when transitioning to a more energy-efficient solution like vehicle electrification.  I see delivery vehicles as being similar to taxis.  There are some challenges in terms of vehicle availability.  That needs to ensure that they can align with original equipment manufacturers, OEMs.  OEMs are automakers.  They need to ensure that there are components that can be shared between delivery vehicles and cars.  This is already common practice by some of the automakers, though not necessarily all.  Delivery vehicles are a segment that are naturally well suited to transition to electric in a cost-efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Thank you for the good question. We can be much more ambitious on mode shift and decarbonising school transport.  That would require a raft of complementary policies.  In other words, a combination of carrots and sticks.  I offer a few suggestions.  There is a target to increase the numbers of children travelling to school by bus.  We should also look at the timetabling relating to buses in order that it does not take too long for children to get to school.  We should also look at the costs.  For most people, driving is cheap if they already own a car.  Driving is actually cheaper than buying an annual bus ticket.  We could look at who is entitled to school transport based on the distance from their school.  We could shorten the distance by which children are entitled to school transport.  Obviously, we could increase the infrastructure in order that we can start to measure and set targets for the number of schools that footpaths which are connected to the local town or village.  Better still are protected cycle lanes.  We can also disincentivise cars by, for example, removing parking and by banning idling outside cars.  We could also have softer, more educational measures, such as information campaigns and competitions in schools.  Schools could set their own targets and start tracking, for example.  All of this should be complementary to more dense urban development, which means building houses close to schools.  That is simple but important.  We should make sure that neighbourhoods are bike- and walk-friendly.  The electrification of school buses should also be looked into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Hannah Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Daly.

For the record, I am in the convention centre.  I have a question for the witnesses on plug-in hybrid vehicles.  These vehicles represent the greatest increase in electric car purchases.  We have seen something like a 142% increase in sales of these vehicles in the first three months of this year compared with a 54% in pure EVs.  They are still heavily subsidised, although I know their subsidisation is not quite the same as with full electric.  However, there is still a grant of &euro;2,500 per vehicle.  Reports late last year indicated that plug-in hybrids are not as environmentally friendly as thought and do not have the capacity to reduce emissions to the extent that we believed they had.  In that context, I wonder whether witnesses think that there should be subsidisation of plug-in hybrids or whether the focus should be on pure EVs at this stage?  There is a risk that people buy these cars in the belief that they are doing the right thing.  In a few years&rsquo; time, however, they will be pushed to move to full electric.  A number of years ago, I bought a diesel car.  I did a load of research on it.  We were told that diesel was the most environmentally friendly option.  I did all the work on it.  It was a big investment.  I bought a brand-new car and, then, a number of years later, I was told that I had done the wrong thing.

I would much rather see that subsidy given to electric bikes or other light EVs than to plug-in hybrid vehicles.  They tend to be the ones that cost an awful lot of money, for example, Lexus, Land Rover, etc.  It makes people feel a little bit better.

To the extent which plug-in hybrids are not used for electric driving, policy action can address the way all-electric driving in plug-in hybrids is actually measured.  The test values lean towards a high share of all-electric driving.  If the share of all-electric driving from testing is revised, it can better reflect the performance of plug-in hybrids.  That has implications on the types of subsidies they would get, for example, once we have different rates of taxation based on grant subsidies per kilometre.<\/p> <p>  Other policies can maximise all-electric driving of PHEVs.  They are related to similar technologies that would allow for pricing and have to do with geofencing.  One can, therefore, essentially enforce all-electric driving in cities, for example.  People will have to charge to ensure that they can access cities.  That, therefore, requires smart policy developments on the side of the geofencing.<\/p> <p>  There are also impacts, which I think should be mentioned, on resource efficiency.  The fact is that a hybrid has a smaller battery for a commute and can ensure all-electric driving.  There are also impacts on jobs.  Due to the transition, the battery hybrid still uses a combustion engine.  This is less relevant for Ireland.  A transition needs to happen in vehicle manufacturing and a PHEV, in a way, can help dealing with that.  There are pros and cons but I wanted to flag that this is part of the equation.

They all made strong statements along the lines that EVs are only one part of the solution.  I was heartened to hear those statements that we need to think about reducing our number of journeys with a modal shift to improving active travel networks, investing in public transport and so on.  I thank them for making those statements.<\/p> <p>  Not all EVs are the same.  Our policy needs to recognise a good EV versus a not-so-good EV in respect of greenhouse gas emissions and other issues and impacts on society.  In that regard, perhaps the witnesses could elaborate on incentives for light EVs and physically smaller EVs versus, for instance, the heavier and larger ones.  That is where we need to go.  It would be a severely missed opportunity if we treated all electric vehicles the same and ended up with large SUV-type cars clogging our roads, notwithstanding the benefits they might bring in greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, we could bluntly incentivise EVs and say we want 1 million EVs on our roads by 2030.  A total of 1 million EVs sitting in driveways in Dublin, however, are not going give us the emissions cuts that one million EVS spread out in a dispersed fashion around the country would.  I am interested to hear about policy measures that can, perhaps, target that rural need versus the urban need.  Members will recall Mr. Andrew Murphy of Transport and Environment, who has since joined our Climate Change Advisory Council.  He more or less said that we should not have private cars in our towns and cities and that EVs are a solution for outside our urban areas.  I am interested in the views of the witnesses on that.<\/p> <p>  Finally, Dr. Daly made an important point, which was that this should not be about maximising the transition to EVs but minimising the sale of fossil fuel vehicles.  It seems that we need to do that rapidly and urgently.  The fossil fuel vehicles that are sold now are going to lock in emissions for eight or nine years when we are trying to have more than a 50% reduction in transport emissions.

On the first question around light EVs versus SUVs, we could look at the taxation base.  Research we conducted in TCD shows that we cannot have zero tax on EVs because they still use the roads.  There needs to be funding in place for the roads and their upkeep.  One could, however, change or look at the model of charging by both the CO2 per kilometre driven and the weight of the vehicles and how carbon efficient they are.  The Deputy is correct.  SUVs and bigger cars have other problems when we start to look into the engineering and transport side.  These bigger cars are also more dangerous for cyclists.  They also take up more space and that is an issue.<\/p> <p>  I like the point about all these EVs being sold to basically sit in driveways in Dublin.  I completely agree.  EVs are running on the roads 5% of the time compared with renewable energy technology from wind turbines, which for 30% of their lives are producing renewable energy whereas it is only 5% of the time for an EV sitting in a driveway.  The Government is spending money on this to enable it to happen and it should.  The model of sharing these vehicles among people is, however, something at which we need to look.  The ITF report, which I cited in my opening statement, states that we could get a 30% reduction in emissions in Dublin by having 2% of the vehicles we currently have.  That is from stark modelling it did where there would be low car ownership in a city such as Dublin.<\/p><p>We do not have to go to that level.  We need to look at that shared model.  If the &euro;13,000 in incentives given for an EV could be spread out over five or six people in a town or village, we would get much more bang for our buck.  That is what we need at the moment.  On the last question, which related to how to take fossil fuel cars out of the market, as Dr. Daly mentioned, these cars are going to be with us for a long time if they are being purchased now.  A friend of mine recently bought a diesel car.  It is almost like buying a house that has subsidence.  Why on earth would someone do that at the moment?  We need to look at non-fiscal measures as well, such as low-emission zones, to send a message to the market that these diesel or petrol cars will no longer have freedom to access all places.  I do not believe that should extend to allowing EVs to use bus lanes.  That cannot work in our cities.  However, these non-monetary messages that we can put out could be key.  It is a question of behavioural change.  The SEAI has ramped up its game in this space.  It is putting out the cost of these vehicles and encouraging this transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Caulfield","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Some more progress on taxation and regulation is also required.  With regard to parking charges, there is currently massive public subsidisation to allow for free parking.  My local town, the lovely seaside village of Kinsale, is rammed with cars, which are taking up waterfront space in this world-famous village.  As Dr. Caulfield alluded to, this relates to the area of behavioural change but it relates even more so to values.

I will add one thought.  In the case of Ireland, I expect that the owners or users of EVs are likely to take shorter trips.  The longest trips made by Irish car owners are likely to be lower.  They are shorter and cover fewer kilometres than the longest trips made by an average continental European car owner simply because Ireland is an island state and fewer long-distance trips can be made than can be made in parts of continental Europe.  That means that it is possible that consumer preference may be satisfied with smaller battery packs for EVs.  There could be scope to think about policies that are tailored to provide different incentives for different types of battery EVs.  Vehicles with smaller battery capacity may be encouraged rather than those with large ones, which have emissions implications arising from the manufacturing of the batteries.  There are also policies in other parts of Europe whereby price thresholds are used to avoid subsidising expensive EVs.  This can act in the same direction and has better implications for equity.  I agree with the point made regarding low emission zones in the responses to the third question on how to take fossil fuel cars out of the market.  On vehicles sitting idle, this is a problem that is most pressing in areas that are densely populated.  These areas are better served by public transport than areas with lower population densities.  The best way to address the integration of public transport with new forms of mobility is through these avoid and shift measures, measures that have to do with urban planning, road space, location and the reinforcement of public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I welcome the presentations, which were thought-provoking.  I was anxious for us to have this debate because I have been concerned for some time about this notion that we can have 1 million EVs on the road by 2030 and that this will, to some extent, solve the problem.  The witnesses' research and modelling has clearly identified that this is not enough.  I support everything they have said about it not being a matter of a one to one switch and about how we have to reduce the use of cars and the numbers of cars.  They have covered all of this.  They have come at these issues from an academic perspective but I am mindful that we are in a political environment and that this has to be sold to the public.  Just because it is the right thing to do does not always mean that it will be accepted by the public.  While there has been considerable buy-in with regard to climate change and reducing carbon output, even within the political sphere, I have seen the difficulties in addressing the kinds of measures that are necessary.  Carbon pricing, for example, does not have universal political support.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that, come the next election and when consumers start to see the impact on their lives, these issues may become politically divisive.  That is why I am interested in any examples the witnesses may have of other jurisdictions where this has been done well.  It seems that, notwithstanding people's desire to do what is right, unless the incentives are clear and obvious, behavioural change will not be achieved.  The witnesses are correct about incentivising the purchase of electric bicycles and so on but it is a big step to move from a car to a bike.  It is probably a smaller step to move from an EV to an electric bike.  With the assistance of the witnesses, we need to chart the behavioural change required over time.  <\/p> <p>  I look on in wonderment every September when we, as politicians, are challenged to address school transport issues with the Department of Transport.  If a pupil is 0.1 km too close to the school, he or she does not get the ticket.  I am of the view that all kids within the catchment area of the school should get free transport.  There should be no charge whatsoever.  This would have two effects.  It would take away the incentive or necessity for the parents to drive but it would also get children using public transport at an early stage.  If they become early adopters, they will be retained for life.  It is the same with EVs.  I have seen people who have taken the jump to an EV and, as a result, have changed many other aspects of their lives with regard to carbon output.  I would be interested to hear about that.<\/p> <p>  The taxi fleet was mentioned.  There was an interesting example in that regard in Copenhagen or Amsterdam.  Dr. Caulfield might refer to that.  Does he see any role for green hydrogen?  As the witnesses will know, the ESB has some imaginative plans to generate green hydrogen at Moneypoint through the proposed deployment of significant wind farms off the west coast.  Is there a role for that?  Should we bring it forward?  This goes back to what Dr. Daly said about the large transport fleet and heavy goods vehicles.  I am sorry; I have gone on a bit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#F00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":733,"content":"<p>That is okay.

I will start from the last question, which was on hydrogen.  The impression I get is that hydrogen is best suited to situations where demand is great.<\/p><p>I am thinking of refineries or fertiliser production.  Basically, it is about large industrial complexes.  The benefit of hydrogen can be maximised there because distribution and transport, which are costly steps in the use of hydrogen, are not needed.  If hydrogen can be produced at low cost, then it is probably best to address it to areas of large, concentrated demand.  Beyond that, there can also probably be spillover to other ancillary sectors around those areas of concentrated demand.  I am more sceptical about the rapid uptake of hydrogen as an energy vector for transport vehicles.  There is also a gap in cost.  Renewable electricity is likely to be cheaper as an energy vector and easier to access than renewable hydrogen for transport vehicles.  That means that if we compare battery electric solutions to hydrogen-based solutions, we are likely to get a competition on cost that ends with the battery solution winning over hydrogen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I apologise to Mr. Cazzola but I was thinking of it in the context of heavy goods vehicles rather than as a replacement fuel for domestic or personal vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#G00200","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I do not think that makes a big difference.

My personal impression is that on cost, it is likely battery will also win for heavy goods vehicles.  The exception may be trucks travelling long distances such as from Poland to Spain.  There are also other related challenges with whether electric roads would be better than hydrogen on that so there are more open questions for that use case but we will first see the transition to electrification on local and medium deliveries and that will then expand.

On the question of how we bring people with us, it is all around behaviour change.  Behavioural change takes time.  We have eight and a half years to do this.  It took 13 years to reduce car usage coming into the canals in Dublin by 11% so this is going to take time to do.  As I said earlier, we are asking people to throw the kitchen sink at it and asking people to do everything at once.  As the committee will be aware, it is not just in transport but in agriculture, energy and every other space.<\/p> <p>  On the taxi example, I am not sure about the one in Copenhagen the Senator was talking about as I am not aware of it.  The issues around the taxi uptake in Ireland relate to the models drivers have had to adapt and use.  Taxi drivers are the same as us when we think about an EV.  They are wondering what the range is, how many trips might they lose on charging, where the chargers are located and how much dwell time they will have around charging.  Those are the kind of things we must look at there.<\/p> <p>  On hydrogen, the Senator is correct that the bang for buck is to be found with heavy goods vehicles.  However, we must start to look at it for heavy rail as well.  There are definitely possibilities there.  I would like a study to be done on the comparison of the electrification of our rail network compared to using hydrogen.

However, it is important for balancing our variable renewables on an isolated grid so there is a strong role for hydrogen, although maybe not in transport.<\/p> <p>  The question on fairness and how to get public buy-in was interesting.  I fully agree that we must use a combination of carrots and sticks to achieve this transition.  If rich people get all the carrots and poor people get all the sticks, there will not be public buy-in and it will not be fair.  Thus, we must ensure there is a limited role for carbon pricing beyond what we have now because additional carbon pricing will hit people who do not have the opportunity to buy an EV.  This goes back to Deputy Leddin's question, which I did not answer, on how to curb the sale of fossil fuel vehicles now.  My suggestion is a tax based on the whole-life emissions of a vehicle when it enters the country either new or second-hand.  This would basically incentivise the people bringing cars into the country and who can afford new, bigger cars to do that.  Also, we have a cap of, I think, &euro;60,000 on a new EV that can attract the subsidy.  We should consider bringing that down and differentiating the subsidy on EVs.<\/p> <p>  Senator Dooley also asked about examples from other jurisdictions.  The transport issue is tied up with the housing crisis.  If we can make it easy and affordable for families and people to live in an area where they do not need a car, that would be an equitable solution.  I am thinking of somewhere that is appealing and has good reliable public transport, where they can walk and cycle to work, bring their kids to school and get shopping without a car.

The question I am interested in was also raised by Dr. Caulfield.  If it is true that 20 cars are idle for every one that is moving, there is a massive gain to be had if we can develop a shared vehicle model.  I am just trying to get an understanding of how we can radically shift that.  That seems to be the easiest thing we could do.  Granted, it does not cut out journeys and bikes and so on, but are there good models of doing that rapidly?  It has all those benefits Dr. Daly mentioned.  I have done a bit on the circular economy and this is where the big gains are to be had.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the comments on the housing sector.  I live on a street where all the homes are probably four-bedroom and I do not think anyone has more than one or two empty nesters.  The same thing about how we share vehicles may well apply to how we share our buildings.  A building, typically, is issuing twice what a car is in emissions.  I am thinking of that concept of redesigning our entire supply chain.  That leads me to a question on Dr. Daly's presentation.  She mentioned that she has done a low energy demand scenario and had the humility to say all models are wrong but some are useful.  I am interested in what is radically different in that.  What are the infrastructures we need to prepare and what are the polices that would change?  The converse of that comes from her finding that with the 50% reduction, the marginal abatement curve is now &euro;1,000 per tonne.<\/p><p>Everyone recognises that the previous 30% target was less ambitious.  With it, 75% of the measures paid for themselves.  The top was only &euro;300 per tonne.  This is &euro;300 in perpetuity throughout the life of the vehicle, building or whatever is involved, which is scary.  What policies would the 51% require to be introduced, going beyond our discussion of transport?  That is a wake-up call to people who need to start designing alternatives.  I would like to hear more about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#G01000","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":746,"content":"<p>The marginal abatement cost in 2030 is certainly hair-raising.  I will provide a few notes for context.  We have modelled different levels of effort between agriculture and energy.  We focused on energy.  To meet the overall 51% target, if agriculture reduces by 20% or less, which is in the current agrifood strategy, then energy needs to reduce by more than 65%.  With the marginal abatement curve, as we move towards more abatement, small additional levels of effort produce exponentially higher marginal abatement costs as we pick the low-hanging fruits and come to the hard, high coconuts, as my colleague said.  We are modelling a conservative, business-as-usual scenario, with low levels of new technological breakthroughs.  There is a substantial volume of new wind and solar energy but we do not assume much more bioenergy or demand reduction in the core scenario.  That is not to say that this is what will happen or that the costs will be &euro;1,000 per tonne but it is to hold up a mirror and say that if we need to reduce energy emissions by 60%, 65% or 70%, if we do not have low energy demands and there are no energy breakthroughs, then it will be extremely challenging to reach the target.  This is why we have modelled the low energy demand scenario.  It is a fantastic scenario from the top down.<br\/><br\/>We do not model in detail how each of the individual measures are met.  We have a narrative around every sector.  It includes freight kilometres <i>per capita<\/i>going back to what they were in, for example, in 2010, and passenger kilometres <i>per capita<\/i>reducing, sharing different segments, with a mode shift, and a reduction in total trips.  It includes a reduction in cement demand because of a move to timber-framed housing.  In the residential sector, internal temperatures go down somewhat and we reduce the size of new houses.  We do not say how we can get there, what policies are required or what the cost of achieving that is.  We need to do more work on that and to collaborate with people doing these things on the ground.  We look at the systems.  If we focus on all forms of low energy demand in a systemic way, it would reduce the size of the energy system and the speed at which we need to ramp up renewables, wind, electric vehicles and so on.  If we manage to get these things done correctly, it would make the challenge much easier.  We also have scenarios that assume technological breakthroughs, including more use of hydrogen, EVs coming faster and production of more biofuels.  That also makes the transition easier.  If the low energy scenario is combined with a scenario that is optimistic about technology, it is even more feasible, so that is what we should aim for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Hannah Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":747,"content":"<p>If I understand the question correctly, it is whether there are good motives to shift rapidly to shared systems.  There is a need for systems that offer a better value proposition for cars.  There are solutions that require, for example, policies such as road space reallocation and making modes of travel available that can complement or feed public transport services.  For example, the potential of mobility as a service could be tapped into and different ways to move integrated.  This also needs to come with sticks and parking policies can be a stick to get people to move away from cars towards public transport.  Parking policy can also be differentiated by greenhouse gas emission performance of vehicles so it can help with the transition.  Simply making part of the city harder to access by car and ensuring that there is a better offer with public transport means that people would switch towards that.  This helps shifting uses and choices towards modes that are inherently more energy efficient.  That helps to move to the low energy demand scenario by altering people's model choice.  I am not sure I got the idea of sharing buildings or housing.  Denser neighbourhoods are more prone to being favourable to choices other than car travel.  There are other choices related to urban planning, transit-oriented development, or the integration of different modes, which can ensure that even in a scenario without technological breakthroughs, there is a move towards a scenario that is compatible with lower energy demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

Research conducted in the USA shows that every shared vehicle in a city gets rid of 15 other vehicles.  There is potential for them.  In urban areas of Dublin and Cork, the distances that we travel are quite short and alternatives are available.  The bang for our buck from emissions is much lower.  I disagree with what Senator Dooley said about these shared vehicles being successful in rural areas.  I know of an example in Skerries where there is a shared car used by people to get to and from hospital appointments.  That is where the big savings are.  The distances travelled outside our cities are quite significant.  Research that we conducted in Dublin with one of the companies shows that it was depressing car purchases.  People were not purchasing cars because they have this shared option.  People moving to Ireland and working in places such as Google Docks were not going to buy a car because they had this shared option.

Dr. Daly correctly pointed out that transport, land use and housing are all interconnected.  Transport connects where we work and live.  In the strategic housing developments all around the country, we can encourage local authorities to change parking requirements.  If a housing development is in an area that is densely populated, shared vehicles are the alternative.  Dublin City Council has a number of fantastic examples of where this is working.  That is where the State should invest and policy should drive that forward.  We are talking about a shared vehicle.  If we can get ten people to use an EV for a &euro;13,000 incentive, we would get much bigger bang for our buck.  We are looking at behavioural change as well.

I thank our witnesses.  It has been a fascinating discussion and their opening statements were certainly thought-provoking.  I was taken a little by what Senator Dooley said about the school transport scheme.  He made a very thoughtful remark on incentivising children to make the change at an early stage in their lives.  Interestingly, the transport committee had a discussion some years ago on the American approach to school transport versus ours and the fact that less than half a kilometre creates such a problem for so many children in Ireland, which, as was stated, incentivises their parents to get in touch with us every September.  That is a matter we should look at a little more closely.<\/p> <p>  I have limited time and everybody has said a huge amount already.  One of the issues I am taken by is the shared use of vehicles, particularly in our suburban environments.  Shared vehicles are already in urban environments; whether they are used or not is a matter for the companies to inform us about.  To incentivise a person to get out of their vehicle in a suburban environment and-or use a shared option, it occurs to me that use of the taxation system would be a progressive approach, either by using companies to incentivise their employees and-or incentivising individuals.  Given the progressive taxation system we have in Ireland, it would seem a logical course of action to encourage the transition and to switch society over to more sustainable means of transport.<\/p> <p>  The research I have conducted over the past few years indicates that range anxiety does not really exist in Ireland, unless you are going from Donegal to Kerry.  The vast bulk of vehicles, whether hybrids or otherwise, can do well over 400 km.  People should not really say they are worried about range anxiety when they are driving to Galway because their vehicles have the necessary capabilities.  The development of that technology has taken decades.  The current space race is funded by individuals but if you go back to the development of rocketry and aeronautical technologies in the 1950s and 1960s, it took people working on Mercury, Gemini and all those other programmes decades to develop the technology.  We are asking car companies and engine manufacturers to change dramatically the entire basis of our transport system over a short period of years.  It stands to reason that there has to be electric vehicles costing &euro;100,000 on the market today because it costs billions to develop them.  At the same time, we also have to recognise that we must incentivise individuals to make those changes in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p> <p>  The point I wanted to make on the development of the technology, and Deputy Leddin touched on this, is whether there is somewhere you can look at available electric or hybrid vehicles and grade them, similar to a league table, on their credentials.  Dr. Caulfield mentioned this already in his prior comments on replacing combustion engines with electric vehicles not being the way we should go.  It occurs to me that people need to be able to make informed choices and the taxation system should be used to incentivise them.  From next year, all new combustion engines should be the subject of a differentiated tax base.  That is my view on all these issues to disincentivise people from buying vehicles with combustion engines unnecessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#J00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I will allow Dr. Daly in first because she has to leave in five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#J00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I can stay a few minutes longer.  I see Senator O'Reilly would like to ask a question as well.  I thank Deputy Alan Farrell for the question.  I will address some of the benefits of shared car schemes.  My colleague, Dr. Caulfied, has more expertise on this, but once someone owns a car, or a family has two cars, he or she is much more likely to use it than a bicycle or bus.  For example, when it is time for me to start commuting to UCC it will be virtually free for me to drive because parking is free but the bus costs &euro;10 for a round trip and takes twice as long.  Once I own a car, all of the upfront cost is on ownership rather than use, so the incentive is very much to use it.  Shared cars remove that incentive and allow me to make the best judgement on what is the best mode for me on every trip, not just on my transport mode over the year as a whole.  If I need to, let us say, go to IKEA to buy furniture, take my children to school or do something else, I will choose the best option for each one of those trips.  I will not by default take a car.

There is evidence for that.  The challenge with shared vehicles is ensuring buy-in.  One aspect that needs to be maximised is to focus on solutions that have increased the adoption of car sharing.  There are different forms of car sharing, some of which are digitally enabled and still focus on vehicles that are used more than average.  It is important to pair low carbon and digitally enabled forms of car sharing, including peer-to-peer cases.  That may be something that increases adoption.  Ultimately, it is all about the cost of access, whether it is the cost of the service itself or the time needed to invest in it.  If that is the case, then we will end up in a situation where there will still be the barrier of choice Dr. Daly mentioned.  We will still need to have an overall reduction in total transport service demand or some degree of prioritisation.<\/p> <p>  One issue that has not been addressed is the subsidisation of on-demand services.  This could be a solution that helps deal with the lack of access to public transport in areas that cannot be served due to cost but still enables access to mobility.  There could be scope for thinking about the way to have a tailored intervention for those areas with different types of transport on demand.  In a way, that links to the concept of sharing mentioned already and it is also something that would end up being provided by vehicles that had higher utilisation rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question is very interesting.

She can respond in writing if she wishes.  I wish to concentrate on the school transport issue.  The last statistics I have showed that 30% of traffic in the morning, certainly in Galway, was school transport.  I see from Dr. Daly's figures that 60% of primary school children are being driven to school.  The rules relating to school transport, including that one must be 3.2 km from the local primary school or 4.8 km from the local post-primary school, are the reasons for that.  Now, more than ever, parents are making choices about which schools they want their children to attend.  Under the patronage system, 90% are Catholic schools, 5% are other religions and 5% are multi-denominational.  Apart from that, schools get to make so many decisions on how they teach that parents are making more decisions in that context.  I see that increasing, but we are not allowing children to take school transport to a school of their choice.<\/p> <p>  The part that is forgotten is that while one could say that somebody can cycle under 3.2 km, it is simply not safe for children to cycle.  There could be another bus, but nobody really wants to put an eight-year-old on regular public transport.  In addition, everybody needs to get to work afterwards.  One could cycle 3 km to bring one's child to school, but where does one go to get to work?  The whole thing is so complex that it becomes not a solution.  Is Dr. Daly suggesting that we drop all those rules so that every child should be able to get onto a school bus?  That is my first question.  I realise we are discussing EVs, but if we could eliminate that 30%, we would go a long way to reaching our targets.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the EVs, there has been much talk in this session about car sharing.  I looked into car sharing.  In the end, it was not cost effective and we were going to have to change our lives to get to the closest place where one might pick up a car.  It was not going to work for a family.  Dr. Daly has addressed some of the models we might examine, but has she looked at what the buy-in is around that?  Should we concentrate not on eliminating idle cars but on trying to make our cars more idle?  It is putting our hands up and saying every family is going to have a car, but how do we get them to leave the car in the driveway?  The focus on parking that Dr. Caulfield spoke about is critical to that.  We need to have the two messages coming out of this.  Let us have idle cars, but let us not have too many idle cars that we do not need.

I will put my question directly to Dr. Daly and I have two further questions for the other witnesses.  My question relates to school transport, an issue that appears to resonate a lot with the committee membership.  It is probably because many of us are from small town Ireland.  I am from Clonakilty which Dr. Daly is familiar with as it is over the road from Kinsale.  It has a similar population.  There are approximately 5,000 people in Clonakilty.  Both of the secondary schools are on the eastern side of the town while the main new residential areas are on the western side.  That is the way the town has developed, and it is too late to go back. We cannot undo and redo the planning on that.  Obviously, the ideal situation is to create bicycle and pedestrian connectivity from the residential areas to the secondary schools but it can be quite a hike for some people.  Is there potential for the city-type school bus in our small towns, perhaps an electric bus that would do a run through the estates?  Dr. Daly is familiar with Kinsale and I can testify as to what happens in Clonakilty.  There is the morning rush hour, as was mentioned by Senator Pauline O'Reilly, where between 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. the town is absolutely chock-a-block.<\/p><p>It is because parents are trying to get their children, in the case of Clonakilty, from the west side of the town to where the secondary school provision is, that is, to the two secondary schools on the eastern side of the town.  The school transport in a constituency such as Cork South-West is mainly based on getting kids from rural areas into the main towns for secondary school.  Is there potentially a place for small-scale electrified buses to do a run of the estates or does that go against what we are trying to achieve?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#K00900","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":767,"content":"<p>It is a great idea.

Can he elaborate and explain how that kind of cost could be incurred by congestion in 2033?  <\/p> <p>  The next question is for both Dr. Caulfield and Mr. Cazzola.  Deputy Alan Farrell spoke on range anxiety.  It may be that it should not be there but the fact is that it is there and is a deterrent to people, particularly in rural constituencies such as mine, from purchasing electric vehicles.  I can understand that because an electric charging point is still very much a novelty in places such as west Cork.  We all know where the local ones are because there are so few.  The local authority has been tasked with installing charging points for electric vehicles in certain villages.  The process seems to take forever.  What can we do to increase the uptake of electric vehicles in rural Ireland?  Speakers alluded to that being where some of the biggest gains are to be made. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#L00300","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":769,"content":"<p>If I might respond on the electric buses, it is a bit outside electric vehicles, but my experience from looking at international research on trips to school is all about educating our kids around how they travel to school, more education on cycling and making that safer.

As that figure comes from an Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, report, it was research done by the State on Dublin.  That is how that congestion value is estimated.  That is how we can justify building the mega transport projects, by reducing that &euro;2 billion.<\/p> <p>  I think range anxiety is a good thing because it makes people think about where they are travelling and whether they have enough power to get from A to B, which can be a good thing.  On the EV charging points, I am going to Baltimore next week for holidays.  If I had an EV I would be starting to consider where I would charge.  People do know where these points are.  The future is moving towards rapid EV charging points that are spread out across the country where people can get 80% or 90% charge in a couple of minutes.  I have concerns on the proliferation of EV charging points across the country.  Will they become our generation's new telephone boxes, when technology will get to the point where someone can get an 80% charge at a station in a couple of minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Brian Caulfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":772,"content":"<p>It would be great to see a more widespread installation of those rapid charging points.

It is very rare to see a charging event happening elsewhere.  The other places are destination chargers, such as in supermarkets, and eventually fast chargers.  I have a hard time imagining that we will use EV fast chargers in the way that we use petrol stations today.  The behaviour will change and move towards something that resembles more the way we charge a telephone rather than the way we fuel a car.  Focusing on the availability of home chargers and access to charges at the workplace is probably the best way to deal with range anxiety and to ensure that the deployment of the charging infrastructure is aligned with the requirement of an electricity grid that will struggle to ensure that everyone fast charges.  It will be much more costly to go in that direction rather than to ensure that we have the flexibility in parking the car, leaving it overnight and ensuring that it is charged in the morning.  Many customers can do that.  If they cannot do that at home, they can possibly do it at work if they need to go to work by car.  Again, I am not arguing that as the best choice but quite the opposite, which is something we discussed at the meeting.  Those are the most convenient and the most used ways to charge EVs if you look at countries that have a high penetration.  I would rather take lessons from them on how to deal with range anxiety.  I expect range anxiety will be less of an issue in Ireland compared to other parts of the world given the average travel distance.  I expect the vast majority of trips will be easily covered by EVs with the range that is already available commercially today.

It is probably inevitable that something like that will come in here too.  There seems to be agreement among members and witnesses that it has to be a priority.  Separate to setting a target, whether 20% or 30%, what measures would be required to achieve a reduction in vehicle kilometres?<\/p><p>I have some ideas.  In our urban areas, we need to make it less easy to drive around and then we will get a natural reduction in the kilometres driven.  Perhaps our witnesses could speak about the role of advertising in driving behavioural change.  I am not aware but perhaps Mr. Cazzola is aware of advertising campaigns in Europe that are innovative and push behavioural change in order that we get that transition to EVs, bikes, walking, public transport or whatever it is.  Finally, the witnesses might comment on the role of parking charges.  It is related to the vehicle kilometre reduction approach.  I expect that parking charges must be a part of that.  If it is more expensive to park your car in the town or city, you will think twice about driving in.  I am interested to hear the witnesses' comments on those points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#L01000","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I will give this a try.  If you want to achieve a reduction in vehicle kilometres, my gut feeling on that is that you may want to go there but while ensuring you maintain the same level of service in terms of passenger kilometres or tonne kilometres.  To do that, you need to improve the vehicle utilisation factor.  Rather than having single passenger taxi rides, you need to promote pool rides.  You need to increase the amount of people you move with the same vehicle and, similarly, increase the amount of goods you move with the same vehicles.  Today, there are more and more ways to do that by tapping into digital technologies and you need proper regulatory frameworks enabling that, especially in the case of the taxi rides I mentioned earlier or the transport network company, TNC, rides.  Enabling pooling allows for a better use of those services.  There is a rebound related with price but the end result would end up being a total reduction in our vehicle kilometres with an eventual slight increase in passenger kilometres.<\/p> <p>  Beyond those solutions on capacity utilisation, you need to have something that dissuades from using personal vehicles and promotes the use of collective transport.  What the Deputy mentioned in terms of parking charges or policies that make access to certain parts of the urban environment to private vehicles, for example, will also reduce overall vehicle kilometres.  The more you shift towards collective transport mode, the lower the vehicle kilometre, while you can still maintain a high level of passenger kilometres and a high level of access.  Anything that does the job in that direction and helps shift people towards collective transport also ends up with a reduction of vehicle kilometres.<\/p> <p>  Other policies are those that help shifting towards non-motorised mode.  We talked about these cycle paths, footpaths and reallocation of road space in order that people have greater ease in choosing or feel safer in choosing non-motorised transport options.  More than that, there is also better integration of non-motorised transport with public transportation, reinforcing the role of public transport and facilitating choices that end up in a vehicle kilometre reduction.<\/p> <p>  The last question was on advertising.  I am not especially accustomed with specific advertising campaigns in Europe.  When it comes to EVs, one thing I want to say is that we started to see advertising for EVs, once EVs became regulated and there was a need for automakers to be part of the technology needs.  Much of the funding needed for that advertising came out of the automakers' pockets more than those of the public authorities.  There is a role from regulatory requirements that eventually ends up raising investments on the private sector side for the mobilisation of campaigns of this kind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":778,"content":"<p>That is a great question from Deputy Leddin.  It is a no-brainer in that we need to reduce the vehicle kilometres travelled.  My colleague spoke quite eloquently about how we can do that.  That should be a national goal of trying to cap the number of vehicle kilometres travelled.  We also maybe need to start capping the number of cars we have on this little island to get us all to move around.  With regard to the behaviour piece, there are many examples whereby EVs can be encouraged through behavioural use.  I will give the Deputy an analogy.  I spoke about the shared piece quite a bit but when we brought schemes like Dublinbikes into Dublin and all the other regional cities, we found there was an uptake in people buying their own bike.  They no longer saw the need to use or rent a bike.  If there was a shared EV scheme in which people got the experience of an EV, get to know the ranges and all that kind of stuff, that is perhaps the enabler to get them to purchase their own electric vehicle.  The parking is a no-brainer.  We model it.  When the National Transport Authority, NTA, models this, you see that having a free car parking space at the end of your trip is the biggest enabler to get people to travel to work.  I used an analogy earlier comparing UCC to Trinity.  While they are two very different cities in terms of density, the parking is not provided in Trinity and 99% of our staff and students get there by non-car modes.

A bunch of students took that point of strip-mining lithium from developing countries, just so people in developed countries can get around a little bit easier and feel a little bit better about having a private vehicle to move around.  How you do it is at an EU level, in that regulations are put in at an EU level to make sure this lithium and the other minerals are sourced ethically.

As such, they are an important development that can really help to ensure that some car trips are avoided.<\/p> <p>  I echo the remarks of Mr. Caulfied regarding e-scooters.  In the context of moving towards the electrification of cars, there is basically a roll-out of battery plans and a reduction in the cost of batteries.  That will create a massive opportunity to also transition scooters towards electrification in a way that is very customer-friendly.  One can just take the battery from under the seat of the bike, bring it home and plug it into a normal socket; one does not need any new equipment.  It is a great system which helps to avoid lots of emissions that are unpleasant for bike users.  I do not know whether members have ever stood next to a scooter at a traffic light.  It is not the nicest experience in the context of a bike ride.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of minerals, I point to the OECD due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains.  This is an excellent piece of work done by the OECD that we have already been flagging to policy makers in the context of the development of the European battery regulations, that is, the update of the battery regulations that was proposed by the European Commission.  It is essentially a framework enabling greater transparency across the supply chain.  It is a fantastic initiative and a very important requirement.  Ensuring greater transparency is fundamental.  I would not fight a war against dirty minerals; rather, I would try to ensure that the supply chain is developed in a virtuous direction.  We should not pretend that fossil fuel extraction is immune to implications such as wars or other conflicts.  Those factors exist.  The important thing is to ensure that the transition towards renewable EVs can happen in good alignment with virtuous development.<\/p> <p>  That said, there are other aspects to be considered.  Focusing battery use on highly utilised vehicles is another way in order to ensure that every kilogram of minerals delivers the maximum in terms of getting people around and cutting emissions.  Sharing does the same, as does ensuring that the design features of the batteries fit with the concept of a circular economy and recycling.  There is also potential in the context of PHEVs in this space.  PHEVs require much fewer minerals provided we can ensure they are being driven using electric power because, otherwise, they will not deliver sufficient greenhouse gas emission reductions.  I mentioned policy relating to geofencing and enforcing electric driving for PHEVs.  If one takes those points along with the concept of PHEVs and some of the other advantages, so long as one can ensure that PHEVs are driven on electric power most of the time, they can be a resource in the context of the challenges that exist as part of the vast scale of transition towards the very different type of mineral extraction that I expect will result from the transition to e-mobility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021071300002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierpaolo Cazzola"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":783,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cazzola.

I am one of the deputy commissioners at the DPC with responsibility the commission&rsquo;s supervision, guidance and international affairs functions.  My colleague, Mr. David Murphy, assistant commissioner, supervision section, is also in attendance.<br\/><br\/>By way of general observation, the DPC notes that the broad intention of the draft heads of the Bill is to provide &quot;relevant persons&quot; aged 16 or over with access to a range of records and information, including their birth certificate, early life information, care information and medical information.  The 1998 ruling of the Irish Supreme Court in I.O'T <i>v<\/i>. B and the Rotunda Girl&rsquo;s Aid Society, and MH <i>v<\/i>. Rev GD and the society found that neither of two constitutional rights &ndash; the right to know about one's origins on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other &ndash; were absolute and that each might be constrained by the weight of the other, as well as the weight of the common good.  That has resulted in the past, and still results, in a position where agencies in Ireland tasked with providing access to birth and early life information of adopted persons have had to do their best on a case-by-case basis to balance the competing rights in the cases on hand. <br\/><br\/>The DPC notes the Government's intention to propose legislation to the Oireachtas codifying how the balancing of these non-absolute rights should be achieved with a start and end point in favour of the right to identity information.  The DPC considers that it is important in the context of this Bill that clear articulation is given to the proposed policy position to be adopted in favour of providing birth certificates to relevant persons aged over 16 without any process allowing for objection by a birth parent.  An example of such an objection could be on the grounds that it would seriously harm him or her.  Given that the previous iteration of this Bill outlined such a process, it is important that there is clarity around the policy change and why the balancing of rights in these sensitive situations is now deemed to have changed in favour of an absolute right to identity data.  To be clear, the DPC does not advocate for either position.  We are simply pointing out that data protection and privacy issues arise and the State must be able to articulate how it has come to the policy position and what considerations underpin the balancing of rights presented in the Bill. <br\/><br\/>With regard to the balancing of rights, it is clear that Article 15 of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which provides the right of access to personal data, is not absolute.  Article 15.4 states that the right to obtain a copy of personal data shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.  That underlines the need for the Department, Government and Oireachtas to be clear in the context of the Bill as to how the rights and freedoms of the birth mother are not adversely affected to the extent they would restrict the right of access of the individual to information about his or her identity.<br\/><br\/>To be of assistance to the work of the committee, appended to my opening statement are the preliminary observations of the DPC on the Bill, as provided to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Those observations address the balancing of rights in addition to other data protection considerations such as the importance of transparency, the difficulties in treating data, including medical data, as anonymous in this context, and the limitation or restriction of rights provided under GDPR.  The Department has responded positively to the DPC&rsquo;s observations and has committed to further addressing the matters raised.<br\/><br\/>As part of the consultation process, we yesterday received a copy of a data protection impact assessment, DPIA, from the Department but we have not yet had the opportunity to assess it.  I cannot, therefore, give the committee the view of the DPC as to whether the DPIA satisfactorily addresses all the data protection issues that arise.  The DPIA provides an opportunity for the Department to interrogate the proposed processing of personal data in depth in terms of its justification on the basis of necessity and proportionality, in particular the balancing of the right to access to identity on the one hand, and data protection and privacy rights on the other.<\/p><p>It also provides an opportunity to identify and mitigate any data protection risks that arise.  We note that many of the operational aspects of the Bill will be left to the formulation to be decided in guidelines., including the conduct of the tracing function.  Again, the DPIA process is the mechanism by which the formulation of those guidelines can be informed and consideration given to all the necessary data protection policies and measures, including technical and organisational measures required to ensure compliance with data protection law.  I will finish there.  I hope these comments will be of assistance to the committee.  I am happy to take any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sunderland.

The one thing I wanted to home in on was article 15.4 of the GDPR.  We are trying, insofar as is possible, to scrutinise this legislation, and ensure that when it comes out the other end is that it is very much favourable to the survivors and victims of the mother and baby homes.  This is so that they can go back and rightly trace their identity and obtain biological records that relate to themselves, potential medical situations, etc.  <\/p> <p>  There are two conflicting rights.  Article 15.4 states that the &ldquo;right to obtain a copy of personal data should not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others&rdquo;.  GDPR is an EU regulation and comprises set of laws that have come from Europe.  Each nation has taken them on.  They have come in regulation format.  However, it seems that, over the years, we in Ireland have had different interpretations at times.  That should not be the case insofar as regulations are concerned.  However, we have had a different interpretation over the years on a number of fronts.  One example is CCTV, although it comes from a different realm entirely.  We are at odds with some other European nations in some of our appraisals of GDPR.  Could Mr. Sunderland elaborate on the incongruence of article 15.4?  How does he believe that we as a committee, as we try to shape this legislation, can ensure compliance, while still ensuring maximum data is available to the survivor or victim? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#B00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  He rightly pointed to article 15.4.  Article 15 is part of the GDPR, which came into application in Ireland in May 2018.  As I said earlier, article 15 acknowledges that an individual's right of access to personal information is not an absolute right.  It can be restricted if the information could adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.  In the specific context of the Bill, article 15.4 relates to the right of privacy of the birth parent or, particularly, of the right of the mother.  That is the core right in play.  In essence, the Bill facilitates the right of access.  It gives expression to article 15 in respect of the relevant person's broad ability to access information about themselves.  However, it has to be done by balancing, or looking at, the other rights.  It has to conclude whether those rights are being adversely affected.  There is, therefore, a balancing act between the different rights.<\/p> <p>  The implementation of safeguards can provide justification for a measure.  It appears to the DPC that the Bill seeks to achieve that in number of ways.  It proposes a form of safeguards to protect the rights and freedoms of others.  For example, only an individual aged 16 or older can be issued with a birth certificate.  It allows parents to register their contact preference to the national adoption contact preference register.  It proposes an information campaign during the three-month time period, following the commencement of section 3 of the Bill.  It proposes that only a relevant person can apply for a birth certificate following the passing the of the three-month time period.  Where a no-contact preference is registered, there has to be an information session, and so on.  It is not for the DPC to say whether they are effective safeguards.  It appears to us that the purpose of all those measures within the Bill is to strike the right balance and ensure the privacy rights of the birth parents are not overly or adversely impacted.  It seems appropriate to us that the Oireachtas would provide means to ensure that the balance is appropriately struck, and that this right is not adversely or overly impacted.  The Deputy referred to balancing.  That is what we see the Bill trying to do.  We will see what has been provided to us by the Department in its DPIA.  We expect within that assessment to see a further elaboration on each of these measures and how the Department believes that these are appropriate safeguards that allow the right balance to be struck and provides for this broad right of access to information to be allowed in a way, as Article 15.4, states, &ldquo;adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others&rdquo;.   We have raised a number of questions, to which I can speak later, if the Deputy so wishes.  However, we have raised in the observations we provided to the committee a number of the issues we would like to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting Mr. Sunderland.

More importantly, I thank him for his submission.  I am keen to contextualise this discussion of the balancing of rights.  My mother gave birth to me in the Coombe Women's Hospital.  From the moment I was born, or within a feasible administrative period, I had access to my birth certificate, which stated who my mother and father were.  The objective of this legislation is to enable others to have a parity of entitlement to fundamental information about themselves.<\/p> <p>  While I agree a balance needs to be struck, the balance primarily in this legislation is the requirement of this information session or information meeting.  The purpose of the information at that meeting is to impart that there is a no-contact preference, and that the privacy rights of the birth parents need to be respected.  In this way, the State vindicates the right to privacy of the birth parents, while not in any way inhibiting the right to personal or identity information on the part of an individual.  That is their fundamental right.  I see this as being the balance is in the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  In Mr. Sunderland&rsquo;s submission, I am concerned to see him raise issues such as \"sanction\" and \"safeguards\" in that context.  I am concerned that this meeting will not send out the message that a sanction will be considered anywhere.  People do not need to engage GDPR in many respects to track down parents.  The point of this is to have access to information.  Mr. Sunderland said that perhaps the contact preference meeting should include all those who have not indicated a contact preference.  I am a little concerned about that as well because it suggests that we reverse the onus.  If we were to pursue that line, instead of having an obligation to register for no contact, it would become an obligation to register for contact.  At the moment, there is a presumption that if someone has not registered a no contact preference, then contact is fine whereas, if we were to move with Mr. Sunderland has put forward, that would reverse that onus.  I am not sure that balances the fundamental right to information about who someone is as an individual.  I am, therefore, concerned about that.  I would appreciate Mr. Sunderland&rsquo;s comment.  I would like him to bear in mind that I would like this to be a conversation and not a challenge.  These were the issues that jumped out to me, as well as many others. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#B00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":796,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Sunderland want to address some of those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#C00100","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":797,"content":"<p>Yes.  I thank the Senator for her comments.  We do not disagree at all with the view she expressed.

We are not saying that those are the solutions by any means.  We are not disagreeing with what the Senator said but merely providing our analysis in that when you look at the balancing of rights, you look at a whole suite of safeguards that might be implemented and choose ones that strike the right balance and will best achieve the desired outcome, which is the appropriate balancing of rights.  We raise questions the Department should consider and either rule in or rule out.<\/p> <p>  The point we are really making is that it should be clear the Oireachtas did the balancing exercise with this Bill and found, at a global level, that the balance lies in favour of the adopted child, subject to safeguards proposed in the legislation.  That is what we believe the Oireachtas needs to achieve overall.  The detail is in how that is done.  We are not saying the safeguards proposed in the Bill are inadequate by any means, we are just asking if the proper analysis has been done to substantiate and demonstrate that the balance has been appropriately struck.  That is all we are trying to achieve in our observations.  I want to be clear about that.  <\/p> <p>  Again, there is also a distinction between data protection and privacy.  In the context of article 15(4), we are talking about the privacy rights of the mother and how that provision is satisfied so those rights are not adversely affected.  As I said, we are not suggesting that these provisions need to be included in the Bill.

Is that compliant with Article 23 of the GDPR, which sets out when member states can make those exemptions?  Is it permissible at present for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to refuse people access to information about themselves on the basis that it also concerns a deceased person?  Is it permissible at present for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to refuse to give people's medical information directly to them and instead require people to hand over their doctor's details in order that the Department can speak to a doctor about whether they pose a risk to themselves? <\/p> <p>  Does the Bill attempt to stop GDPR operating in respect of all data controllers other than what the Bill refers to as the relevant bodies?  They are currently proposed as the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla.  If that is the case, is that permissible under GDPR?  Why should people not be entitled to request their data from whoever holds it, including the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and other private organisations under current GDPR provisions?  The scheme does not provide a mechanism for adopted people involved in forced family separation to access the administrative files of institutions, agencies and individuals and a full range of the records held by State bodies and private entities concerning early life information.  <\/p> <p>  I will start with those questions.

My colleague, Mr. Murphy may come in on one of the questions on medical information.<\/p> <p>  In respect of Article 23, it is a matter where we raised a note of concern with the Department.  The Bill provides for very blanket provisions restricting all rights under GDPR to the extent necessary to enable persons to access birth and related information in accordance with the provisions of the Act and to enable the agency and authority to provide a tracing service in accordance with the provisions of the Act. <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's latter questions, those restrictions or rights can only act insofar as the Act is concerned.  If there was an intention to restrict in all forms, it would need to be much more explicit.  Insofar as the restrictions apply, it will be in the context specified by the Act.  That would be our reading of the matter.<\/p> <p>  The problem with a blanket exemption or restriction of rights is that it is not, we believe, in accordance with what the GDPR requires in Article 23.  We raised this with the Department.  We have questioned whether it meets the criteria set down in Article 23 and have recommended that it review the position.<\/p> <p>  For example, it is proposed to restrict the right of erasure, which may be a logical position to take.  However, Article 17 of the GDPR already provides exemptions which may apply in certain circumstances.  The right of transparency is a very important right.  Why would there be a blanket restriction?  These are the questions we are asking.  It is something about which we want to hear further from the Department.  If it is not that the restriction of rights is not legitimate in certain circumstances, that needs to be much more defined and specified in terms of the rights that are being restricted, the reasons and the specific sets of circumstances.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's question on deceased person's access to data, I am only aware of this matter through some public commentary.  I do not know all of the details.  The GDPR sets out a process.  An access request can be submitted by an individual for access to his or her data.  There may be an element of mixed data such as, for example, a birth certificate which has someone else's name on it where that person is deceased.  That is the very issue at the centre of discussions on this Bill.  If another person is on the birth certificate, the Department has to carry out a balancing test in terms of the release of the data.  It is possible that other third party data may be released in that context. <\/p> <p>  If the person is deceased it is another set of circumstances in the sense that GDPR is explicit in saying that the regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons.  The Department has to work through the analysis on that.  First and foremost, any request from a person about access to his or her data is a valid request.  I am not sure this is the case but it would not be possible to submit an access request for someone else's data, whether they are alive or deceased.  That would not be a valid access request under GDPR.  However, there may be alternative circumstances where the information of a deceased person is sought, but it is not sought under the GDPR, if I am being clear, because the right of access, first and foremost, relates to one's personal data.  It then extends out and there is a concept of mixed personal data.  A birth certificate is a very good example of that.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to come back on that further, if I have not been clear enough.  I will hand over to Mr. Murphy to address the question on medical information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":817,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question referred to the application of the Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations 1989 from the Department in respect of access requests made regarding the database of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters.  We understand from the public commentary that this has been very difficult.  People have been waiting a very long time to make these access requests and it now seems that another barrier is being thrown in their way.<\/p> <p>  Under the Data Protection Act 2018, the 1989 regulations continue in force.  Their purpose is, essentially, to prevent the release of what is called medical information to an individual under an access request where there is a risk of serious harm to the physical or mental health of that person.  It does not necessitate engagement with that person's GP.  There is a hierarchy of appropriate medical professionals and practitioners who can make that assessment on behalf of the controller.  We have engaged with the Department on its application of the regulation. <\/p> <p>  We can also say that we are aware from the Department that moves are in place to amend these regulations.  We welcome that, principally from the point of view that these regulations date from 1989 and perhaps represent a very paternalistic view of access to medical documents that might have been prevalent at the time.<\/p><p>They represent a paternalistic view of access to medical documents that might have been prevalent at the time.  Section 60 of the Data Protection Act specifically envisages that the Minister will update these regulations and we would welcome if that was done with full stakeholder engagement, involving patient representatives, the Medical Council and so forth.  In addition, Article 23 of the GDPR specifically envisages the possibility of restricting rights such as access, where necessary, to protect the data subject.  In that sense it is not contradictory in and of itself to the GDPR, in that it is a possible ground to restrict access where it may harm the individual, but the application of this needs to be addressed carefully.

Either the statutory instrument is amended, and that is what the Department has indicated, or there is a pragmatic approach under the current statutory instrument that could be used where a medical professional, on behalf of the State, would do a general analysis of the records held, not on a case-by-case basis but on a general basis, and determine whether there is any serious impact arising to individuals from releasing them.

I probably need to reflect on it, but one cannot just assume that who the person's siblings are is necessarily the person's personal data.  It is a complex situation and the further one moves out, the less of a link there is.  Personal data has to relate to the person as an individual and, through direct or indirect means, the person can be identified from that data.  It would be hard to envisage a situation where the name of one's sibling or who that is would be constituted as one's personal data.  It is different in the context of a direct relationship between a parent and the child specifically where that personal data is recorded on a birth certificate.  It is a complex question and I am afraid that I am probably not going to be able to answer it in full today.  It would be my general position that one could not automatically say that information about a sibling is one's personal information.  There may be certain cases where that is the case, but it would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, to look at the link and whether there is any joint or mixed data.  There is a difference between mixed data and what can be constituted as one's personal data.  There can be a context where there is mixed data, for example, a bank account.

When I envisaged the coming into force of the GDPR, it was in the context of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, the modalities and storage of data now and the fact that our data can be transported, used and commodified so easily.  I must confess I never considered it in the context of who the person fundamentally is.  If one was arguing for Ireland or the Government against the DPC where restrictions and balancing of rights come in, I would have said that this is bigger than GDPR.  This is about who a person is and the person's fundamental right to that information.  That said, it engages issues such as where I am advising a company on data subject access requests.  I always advise it to put in a procedure of verifying the data subject who is seeking all this information.  One has to have that absolute proof that this person is who he or she says he or she is, so that it is not for other purposes.  Then we come back to where that is a difficulty.  If one does not know who one is and one is seeking information outside of the provisions of the agency within this context, then proving who one is to get access to that data becomes a difficulty.  That is where I see this needing complex legislation.  We have a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed.  That is a comment rather than a question.  How does Mr. Sunderland think about that?<\/p> <p>  Second, in paragraph 19 he referred to medical information in the context of relevance and said there must be guidelines for the issue of relevance.  How I understood that, and I can be corrected if I am wrong, is the threshold of relevance being when it is the medical information of somebody else and the relevance being congenital matters.  If I was born without a finger, that might be a congenital matter, but if I had a finger severed in an accident after birth, that is not necessarily relevant because it does not relate to a child I gave birth to, for example.  Has Mr. Sunderland any ideas on the thresholds of relevance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021071300002#E00700","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":825,"content":"<p>To comment on the first point, it is not just about the GDPR.  That is for sure.  The GDPR states that the processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind and that it is not an absolute right and must be balanced with other rights.  That is essentially what this Bill is trying to do.  It is looking at the fundamental rights of individuals under EU law, and it has to be seen in the context of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, trying to address the competing rights and striking the right balance.  Ultimately, what the Oireachtas has to do is be satisfied that whatever form of the Bill is passed and enacted, it balances those rights in an appropriate way and one cedes to the other in a way that does not adversely override the rights of others, and that the right of birth parent mother is not so adversely affected that it impedes the right of access.  That is the balance one is trying to strike and the safeguards can provide for that.<\/p> <p>  We felt relevance with regard to medical data needed to be explained and defined further.

IHREC is Ireland's independent national human rights institution and national equality body.  Our commission of 15 met in plenary today and approved our written recommendations to this committee, which will we send on later.<br\/><br\/>This legislation engages significant rights issues, including the rights to identity, privacy, equality and non-discrimination, health, bodily, physical and mental integrity, freedom of expression, dignity and know.  While the commission welcomes that the proposed legislation grants the right to access birth and early life information, we would make recommendations on a number of issues, namely, the right of access to birth certificates and early life information, &quot;no contact&quot; preference and counselling, the child's access rights, and access for relatives of deceased relevant persons.<br\/><br\/>In my listening sessions with mother and baby home survivors, it was clearly stated that the right to truth was key.  &quot;Free and unfettered&quot; access to their personal information and records is essential for survivors.  To deny this could in itself be retraumatising, particularly for older survivors, and, therefore, the burden on legislators to shape this pivotal law effectively is a heavy one.  It is also important for the State's approach to recognise that, while this legislation must vindicate rights to truth denied to so many for so long, there is a corollary that there are birth mothers who have been living under a cloud as inquiries, debates and now legislation happened, fearful that undisclosed information would be revealed.  It is important to be mindful of all.<br\/><br\/>The IO'T <i>v.<\/i>B Supreme Court case has repeatedly been cited as the reason adoptees cannot be provided with unfettered access to their birth and early life information.  While the Supreme Court set out that the birth parent enjoyed a right to privacy and confidentiality, it followed that such a right was not absolute.  The courts have sought legislation from these Houses to support the balancing of rights on access to information.  The provision of birth certificates or early life information is, by definition, the vindication of the right to identity, to personality and to private and family life for adopted people.<br\/><br\/>People seeking access to the records at the centre of the Bill have suffered delays, often of many years, and, therefore, this legislation should mark a sea change in approach.  Therefore, the commission recommends that statutory timeframes for compliance with information requests should be set out.  We also recommend that this legislation establish a system for the management of records across agencies and locations that ensures that significant delays are avoided.<br\/><br\/>The requirement for an information session where there is a no contact preference appears to cater to the privacy rights of natural parents.  However, the extent to which this requirement will achieve that aim is questionable, as the information will ultimately be provided and the theoretical contact will be possible once the information session is held.  This requirement would present a further obstacle to affected persons in accessing long-sought information.  Where the relevant person does not want to undergo an information session, it represents a complete barrier.  We recommend that this requirement be removed from the legislation or, if retained, it should be transformed into no-obligation counselling, support and information services tailored to the needs and wishes of the individual and co-designed with him or her.<br\/><br\/>Children have material questions about their birth and background.  However, head 3(1) provides that only a relevant person aged 16 years or over will have the right of access to his or her birth certificate.  Heads 5, 6 and 7 similarly restrict access to birth information, early life information, care information, and birth and medical information to those aged over 16.  We believe this approach to be inconsistent with the right to identity under the children's rights convention as well as a child's right to his or her identity under the European Convention on Human Rights and case law of the European Court of Human Rights.  The committee may be interested in knowing that other EU states, including Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Italy and Sweden, make provision for children, albeit with different conditions, as we have set out in the paper that we will submit.<br\/><br\/>We also recommend that a proposed restriction of access to materials to &quot;relevant persons&quot; should be reconsidered, given that this &quot;relevant person&quot; could be deceased but his or her birth relatives could be seeking access, including for medical reasons.<br\/><br\/>We are happy to take questions.

It is great that information is being made available to adoptees, which is as it should be, but there is a competing right that the Government is trying to, and the State needs to, vindicate.  The reference in the presentation to birth mothers being fearful of undisclosed information being revealed were tender and moving words, given that I know this to be a difficulty for them.  It is not that they perceive adoptees making contact as a threat.  Rather, it has to do with their current circumstances, for example, the families they are now in, or the knowledge they have carried for a lifetime and that they do not want to return to.  This difficulty is personal to the birth mother in most cases, not the adoptees.  I wish to be clear that adoptees are not perceived as a threat.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Gibney that there is a disconnect between the information session and the objective of the action.  From reading it, I understand it to be an attempt to vindicate a person's right to privacy while also being sure the other person is told the information.

It is the responsibility of the State, while this legislation is being passed, to allay those fears as best it can and to send the information into the homes of Ireland.

In this case, the right to identity and the right to privacy conflict.

There is now an international recognition of the right of people who have been adopted to have access to their birth information and all the other information being sought.

We need to do this in as sensitive, caring and empathetic a way as possible but there is no way around this.  Not just the Irish case law but the other international case law such as that of the European Court of Human Rights also talks about trying to balance these rights and doing so in a proportionate and fair way that harmonises rights.

We are not saying to remove the no-contact preference where the person will be informed that his or her natural or birth mother does not want contact and he or she will then respect that.

One of the key problems with the GDPR interpretation is that in certain circumstances data may be restricted if the release of this information would have an adverse impact on a third party.  As a general principle of law, when one is restricting a right the restriction must be very narrow.  As the data protection commission has pointed out there are clear rules and there must be very specific objective and narrow purpose to the restriction, and it has to be proportionate and necessary.  In the past it has been interpreted very broadly: there may be an adverse impact so therefore we cannot release the information.

The witnesses are here today to discuss the general scheme of the higher education authority Bill 2021 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Ms Donegan to make an opening statement, followed by Ms Dolan and then Ms Austick.  These statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot to ask questions and for the witnesses to respond.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  They have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  To get started, I call on Ms Donegan, our very first witness, to make her opening statement.  She will be followed by the other witnesses as I outlined a few minutes ago.  They have four minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#A00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I hope that all the members of this very important committee have by now had a chance to study the written submission which IFUT has supplied.  Since my time today is limited - I had believed it was limited to three minutes - I will extract from our submission those items which are of particular concern to IFUT or which are less likely to be dealt with by other parties invited to address the committee.<\/p> <p>  The first issue of concern for IFUT is governance.  The Bill&rsquo;s insistence that external representation should constitute a majority in the governance structures is a very negative development put forward without any coherent or sustainable justification.  Higher education is different in kind from the provision of other services.  The university enterprise has to do with ideas and concepts.  Any drift towards giving overarching control to individuals primarily motivated by other concerns, whether business, social, or economic, is entirely inappropriate.  IFUT also wishes to emphasise that this part of the Bill, if enacted, will almost certainly have the possibly unintended consequence of leaving less room for representatives of employees.  This would be completely counter to the policies of successive Irish Governments to enhance worker participation and industrial democracy. <\/p> <p>  The second issue of concern relates to valuing original research and enhancing the status of researchers.  When Albert Einstein was developing his theory of relativity, he is reported to have said that he believed there was only a handful of scholars in the world who understood his work or appreciated its value.  This reminds us that we must always take care to ensure that primary research is valued and is not relegated to a subsidiary role to applied research.  If Irish higher education institutes are to be seen as world class, we must allow them to be leaders in the search for new knowledge and not just the application of existing knowledge.  IFUT is very worried that we have allowed the belief to take hold that we can, as a nation, prioritise research while simultaneously subjecting the actual researchers to shameful levels of job insecurity and precarious employment.  This contradiction is doing huge damage to the attractiveness and reputation of the career of the researcher and is quite shameful in this 21st century.<\/p> <p>  The third issue of concern is that of academic freedom.  The fact that the right to academic freedom is enshrined in Irish legislation through the Universities Act 1997 has long been a source of great pride.  IFUT is very proud to have had some input in the development of that Act.  However, the fact that academic freedom is barely mentioned at all, and certainly not in any consequential way, in this Bill is worrying.  The kind of centralised micro-management of higher education, which is indicated as desirable throughout this Bill as currently worded, prompts us to paraphrase Albert Einstein&rsquo;s famous quote and suggest that if you insist on measuring everything that is valuable, you will end up valuing only those things that are measurable.<\/p> <p>  I express our sincere thanks to the committee for giving us this opportunity to have an input into your deliberations.  I wish members great success in their very important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Donegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":891,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Donegan.

The TUI represents teachers, lecturers, researchers, education professionals and staff in post-primary schools, further and adult education and higher education.<\/p> <p>  The TUI is concerned about the proposed changes to the Technological Universities Act 2018 because many of the provisions of that Act were the subject of the May 2017 agreement with the union involving the Department of Education and Skills, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA.  Consultation and agreement with the TUI is therefore required in order to ensure that the provisions of the HEA Bill 2021, when enacted, will not impinge on existing agreements.  Any proposed legislative changes to the existing Technological Universities Act arising from this proposed HEA Bill must be carried out in consultation with the TUI.<\/p> <p>  In our view, the roles and functions of the academic councils and the governing bodies must be strengthened, and this includes more academic staff representation.  Governing bodies, as Ms Donegan outlined, must have sufficient and proportionate representation from both the academic and student communities.  The voice of the academic community must be facilitated as part of any higher education institution, HEI, governing body.<\/p> <p>  Significant additional funding is required for HEIs as there has been major underinvestment in higher education for a considerable period.  What is proposed is a very competitive, performance-based model which can be restrictive and limit innovation.  The TUI supports and advocates for a publicly funded higher education sector.  Increased investment is required in order to maintain academic quality and standards and the student experience.  Performance indicators can assist with system accountability and transparency.  However, there must be clarity of purpose and precise criteria used for measurement.  In addition, consideration needs to be provided for regional provision, demographics and diversity.<\/p> <p>  On the reform of governing authorities, with a multi-campus technological university, TU, for example, some campuses might not have any representation on the governing body.  This could have a significantly negative effect on the local regions served by TU campuses.  The TUI does not support any changes to the provisions on governing body composition and size contained in the Technological Universities Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  The TUI supports autonomy and accountability.  However, there is a need for accountability within a strong regulatory framework.  The TUI has some concerns around the metrics used for performance-based funding.<\/p> <p>  Engagement with students is important.  However, engagement must be appropriate and relevant to matters of concern to students.<\/p> <p>  Throughout the draft heads of Bill there is an absence of any reference to engaging with the trade unions that represent staff.  We request that such references be inserted throughout the proposed Bill.<\/p> <p>  The TUI has concerns regarding how research will be evaluated.  Significant consultation is required around a HEA legislative role for research and what this would entail.<\/p> <p>  On equality, there should be stronger provisions in the heads of Bill concerning commitments to equality, diversity, and inclusion.  Targets should be set for access, including for those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds and ethic minority communities, including Travellers, refugees and asylum seekers.<\/p> <p>  Finally, there is the matter of serving the public interest.  Publicly funded HEIs must serve the public.  This includes equality of access for all groups to higher education opportunities; the provision of multilevel programmes from national framework of qualifications levels 6 to 10, traditional undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and short programmes for upskilling and reskilling are required.  HEIs must have progression routes that are recognised across the systems to facilitate lifelong learning for citizens in Ireland, the European Union and the UK.<\/p> <p>  I also agree with remarks made by Ms Donegan in respect of academic freedom.  We absolutely agree with what she has pointed out there.

The USI welcomes the latter believes that, in general terms, it goes some way to meeting  the needs of the higher education sector.<\/p> <p>  The USI welcomes the list of objects outlined within the general scheme under head 8, particularly the inclusion of students&rsquo; needs as a primary consideration for decisions within higher education.  The USI firmly believes students' needs must remain the priority across the sector to ensure students receive the most meaningful, high-quality college and academic experience possible.<\/p> <p>  The USI warmly welcomes the emphasis placed on student engagement, participation and student success in head 9 on general functions and supports the continuous endeavour towards a high-quality educational experience for students in higher education. The USI embraces the inclusion of the phrase \"[to] promote, support, and fund excellent research\".  However, it is worrying that the challenges facing researchers in terms of precarity will not be covered in this legislation.  Clear commitments to improving conditions for postgraduate students must be constructed and then upheld at HEI governing bodies and authorities.  In addition, USI is gravely concerned about the reference to value for money and believes it must be carefully considered to ensure the conversation does not diverge towards one of further marketisation of higher education.<\/p> <p>  The USI fully supports the appointment of a student representative of a national student union to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s under head 17.<\/p> <p>  The USI welcomes the commitment to promoting student engagement between students&rsquo; unions and designated HEIs within the Bill under head 43.  This provides a statutory footing for the national student engagement programme, an ongoing collaboration between an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, the USI and Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI.<\/p> <p>  The USI welcomes the provision of a student forum under head 44.  Having said that, the operational detail for this forum is not outlined within the general scheme.  It is imperative that this detail is developed alongside local and national student representatives to ensure the success of this forum.<\/p> <p>  Head 45 provides for a student survey of students at both undergraduate and postgraduate level to be run.  This is welcomed by USI because it is an important piece of work which captures the student voice and provides an evidence base for the development of future policy.<\/p> <p>  Under heads 77, 90 and 98 on the composition of governing authorities for universities, TUs and institutes of technology, the USI welcomes the best practice framework to improve governance.  However, we are concerned there is no requirement of a specific numbers of students in each governing body outlined.  The USI is also deeply concerned that there are no amendments to the National College of Art and Design Act 1971 to resolve the challenges faced by the National College of Art and Design Students Union, NCADSU, in being recognised as eligible to become student representatives on the board.  Similarly, with head 81, the USI is concerned that there is no required minimum number of students on academic councils.<\/p> <p>  It is positive to see the emergence of a clear theme underpinning the general scheme of the Bill, which appears to recognise the importance and value of student representation, engagement and participation.  The provisions in place are promising but they must not be allowed to become a series of tick box exercises and must eventually translate into real, tangible and effective actions and outcomes for the student experience and quality of our colleges.  The ambition of USI is to improve the quality of higher education and to increase access, participation and engagement across the sector.  If the provisions detailed in the general scheme are operated and implemented in full, then that progress can be made.

Ms Austic stated that the USI is gravely concerned about the inclusion of the value-for-money criterion and the risk it poses in the context of pushing us further down the road of the marketisation and commercialisation of third level education.  I very much share those concerns.  We all want value for money, but it is an ideological myth that a market logic produces the best outcomes.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, it is positive to see the emergence of a clear theme underpinning the Bill which appears to recognise the importance and value of student representation, engagement and participation.

Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.<\/p><p> At the end of the day, education is a public good, or should be a public good and it is not always easy to measure.  The Bill refers to evidence of value for money without outlining the criteria.  Proving the value of critical thinking and discovery research is not as straightforward as it might appear on the face of it.  Could Ms Austick expand on her concerns about this issue?  Are there concerns about institutional independence and academic freedom?  Perhaps I could get a response to that question first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#B00600","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":898,"content":"<p>USI firmly believes that access to education throughout the academic journey &ndash; from the point of entry, successful progression and continuing on to the workforce for students who have graduated &ndash; should be accessible to everyone.

We must try to ensure that the way we view education and the narrative that we tell ourselves about having access to education, is that it is a right at the end of the day and that people from all different parts of society have access to education.  Our main interest is in ensuring that undergraduates, postgraduate students and international students get the most meaningful and high quality education experience possible.

That is really disappointing.  The students union is correctly mentioned in a number of tables right through the document.  There are a few examples in heads 17, 18 and 37.  There are phrases such as \"appointed by the Minister\" or \"representative bodies of staff and researchers in higher education providers\", but there is no mention of the trade union movement which is extraordinary.  The membership of the Higher Education Authority again includes a student representative, which is correct, but there is no trade union representative on that body.  That is of huge concern, not only to IFUT but to the trade union movement itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Joan Donegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I share Ms Donegan's concerns.

Because of the shortage of funding we find that there is a race to try to get external funding.

First, we have moved from 14 institutes of technology and now have one technological university in Dublin since January 2019 as a result of the merger of IT Tallaght, IT Blanchardstown and the DIT.  We have Munster Technological University, MTU, in existence now since January 2021.  We have the Technological University of the Shannon coming into being on 1 October 2021.  The international panel is down in Carlow and Waterford and hopefully those colleges will receive technological university, TU, status soon.  Over next week the international panel is engaging in respect of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, Institute of Technology Sligo, IT Sligo, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT.  The technological universities are only beginning to embed and are starting that process.  At that very early stage of the process it is unwise to be changing what has been agreed and negotiated because there has been a great deal of negotiation and discussion in transforming from institutes of technology, IOTs, into technological universities.<\/p> <p>  I will give one example of governance.  If the proposals set out in the Bill are to be followed through, that would mean that not all of the campuses for GMIT, IT Sligo and LYIT would have representation from the staff.  If one is in Letterkenny, which is way out there, one will feel aggrieved as will the people being represented and the general community because all of the institutes of technology have a broader remit which will continue into the technological universities era.

Can she perhaps develop that, please?  Can she also dig down into the idea of how precarious the research job is at the moment?  There is a real issue there particularly around primary research which may not always be directly marketable, as it were, and may be difficult to attract funding for.  I used to research medieval English which was not the most close-to-market field in the entire world.<\/p> <p>  Building on that I will turn to Ms Dolan and give her more time to talk about the role of the TU and how this role differs from universities proper within this Higher Education Authority Bill and I will leave my questions at that to allow for answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#D01400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Primary research would be seen as a kind of curiosity-driven science where we are talking about original research.  This would be more around the direction of the researcher rather than it being directed to the researcher to conduct such research.  Section 12 (a) of the Universities Act 1997, which is something that is very important to Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, talks about &ldquo;advancing knowledge&rdquo;.  We have seen in recent years, particularly in the last ten years, that that connection and alignment with business interests has become very competitive, marketised and linked to industry and growth.  This is limiting innovation and those ideas and concepts that we talked about earlier.  There is a sense from academics that it can be just for short-term business interests which, when we look at university as a place of knowledge, takes away from that primary research which should be as special as the applied research.  We can see that being chipped away and we are concerned about it.<\/p> <p>  On the plight of researchers, this is a calling action.  As a trade union official and general secretary of IFUT it pains me to see that in the number of years I have been working in IFUT that this situation has not improved.  If anything, it is getting worse.  We have students and post-doctoral graduates coming into our universities who are very well qualified and on appalling terms of conditions of employment.  We have recently had this new research career framework which the universities and the Irish Universities Association have signed up to, which more or less talks about seven stages throughout their time where a post-doctoral graduate comes into a university.  It could be four contracts, if one was talking about four years each, which would be a total of 16 years and ends then with termination.  Where else would one see that in any other employment?  What does that mean for the universities?  They are losing their talent and the best people, apart from the exploitation of the talents of those people.  This is a very significant concern.<\/p> <p>  I will draw the attention of the joint committee to what happens to lecturers in our universities.  We saw in the independent expert group Cush Report in 2016 the recommendation that after two years if universities still needed lecturers, they should be employed on permanent contracts.  Here we have the shocking situation where we can have a researcher in a university for a period of 16 years and their contract will terminate.

The fear is that we are moving into a model - if have not already started and are now trying to reverse out of it - where there is a reliance on private sector investment in research.<\/p><p>That is part of the issue with regard to academic freedom.

I share all of the concerns raised relating to researchers and PhD students and some of the terms and conditions that have made it very difficult for them to stay in the sector.  How do we ensure it is possible for them to remain in the sector?  How can the unions help us to consider future learners so that we are not reliant on the State coming up with what it is we need for future employment but, rather, we consider how we, as a society, can move forward in terms of thinking about the future needs of workers?

Provisions should be put in place in order that no matter the area or postal code one in which a person lives and no matter whether the person is a Traveller, a refugee, an asylum seeker or from a socio-economically deprived background, he or she should be able to access higher education.  However, that does not happen when the person does the leaving certificate.  The whole process of giving individuals the opportunity to go to higher education has to start when the child is one, two or three years of age.  The supports need to be in place within preschool, primary and post-primary to enable participation in higher education because, otherwise, we will continue to have the same level of participation in the north inner city or in rural areas which currently have poor representation.

I again offer my congratulations to Ms Austick on being elected president of USI.  It is a great achievement.<\/p><p>I approach this issue having worked as a contract researcher on a research award at third level and I also have experience of having worked in funding agencies, so I have a little knowledge of what it is like to be a contract researcher at third level.  I very much disagree with the statement of Ms Donegan regarding research and funding being linked to industrialisation.  I believe the research prioritisation that has happened in recent years has actually increased the number of PhD students.  In fact, the statistics we have that link back to the Central Statistics Office show that the number of PhD students at third level has increased by 100% since 2011.  The number has increased to 30,000, whereas in 2006 there were approximately 11,000 PhD students.  That shows there has been incredible Government investment in third level to encourage excellence in all universities, as well as the institutes of technology that are now making the transformational leap to technological university status.  I point to the fact that more than &euro;1 billion in Horizon Europe funding has been made available.  That is a milestone for Ireland in terms of the funding that has been achieved by researchers on the ground.  These are research teams that have done incredible things.  We are past <i>juste retour<\/i>.  I believe that what we have achieved in third level and on behalf of the researchers and research teams is absolutely incredible.  It shows that we are internationally competitive.  The areas that are being funded are areas of societal challenge.  That is what is being considered.  Researchers are considering the environment, energy, food production systems, robotics and artificial intelligence, independent living and an ageing population.  These are the areas that are being funded.  This is what researchers are doing.  I really disagree with the remarks of Ms Donegan in that regard.  <\/p><p>I wish to highlight that we are here for pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Higher Education Authority Bill.  As Ms Donegan mentioned in her opening statement, there are many areas to be considered in the context of the precarious situation for researchers.  There is a significant amount to be done in this regard.  However, I point to the number of PhD students who are graduating from university and finding employment in areas outside the academic field.  Many graduates are moving into industry.<\/p><p>Some of the key drivers of innovation we have seen, especially in the west, are in medtech, engineering, links between healthcare and engineering and multidisciplinary research.  They are really driving that holy trinity of universities being embedded in their societies and communities and responding to what we need.  I will point to one example I am aware of.  Even in the past year Since Foundation Ireland, SFI, had funding for Covid-related research.  That funding went, I think, to each and every university and institute of technology and allowed researchers to focus on an immediate impact of a crisis we face this year.  There are certain things there that I would take on board.  How can we work towards supporting researchers in respect of the contracts?  I understand that, whether master's, PhD or post-doc students, it is about excellence and trying to ensure that people graduate to whatever levels they can and then have a career in areas that can be outside of third level.  I will ask Ms Austick of the USI about the students.  This is very much about the student experience.  That is at the heart of the Bill the Minister, Deputy Harris, has brought before us.  What one or two things about the student experience would Ms Austick pull out of the Bill before her?<\/p><p> I will leave it at that for the time being.  I might come back to Ms Dolan if I have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#F00750","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":942,"content":"<p>I cannot reiterate enough how important the engagement with students is.  This can be done through not only the national student engagement programme specifically referred to under head 43 but also the student forum.  The one concern we have is that the operational detail of this is still missing.  The student forum has huge potential to engage with students and to look at the future direction of education and how we can support students and enhance the overall student experience, particularly with the student survey.  We are in partnership with the TUI, the USI and the HEA on the survey.  It reviews annually the student experience from the academic side of things but, as we always mention, the student experience is far greater than just its academic side.  It is all about being able to engage the learning that often takes place outside of the classroom while being able to respond to different things emerging throughout the year by ensuring that the student voice is at the centre and at the top of the table and that as issues arise in that regard they can be addressed immediately and over time to ensure a better, enhanced student experience for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Austick"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":943,"content":"<p>Could I ask Ms Donegan the same question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021071300002#G00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I fundamentally disagree with the Acting Chairman.  Obviously, the number of PhD students coming through correlates with the number of students coming into our universities.  In 2008 we had 150,000 students.  That number went up to 213,000 in 2020, and we expect 240,000 to 250,000 students to come into our universities in 2030.  We should be very mindful of that.  The funding crisis before Covid and Covid on top of it are absolutely stretching resources within the universities, but the Acting Chairman is quite right that the PhD students are coming through.  Our academics have worked really hard through the Covid situation and through that financial crisis to support those students.<\/p> <p>  The Acting Chairman talked about medtech and Covid and the research that was done in a very short time.  I think Professor Luke O'Neill, who was at our conference, would tell the Acting Chairman that but for Covid that funding would not have been given to the universities to study those infections.  Because this was a very important economic issue that had to be addressed worldwide and the absolute support for and importance of researchers working on that issue, funding was available.  However, academics in the humanities, social sciences and arts would say that is not the situation for them.  The reason universities are reaching out to other companies to support them in research is that the funding situation in our universities right now is in crisis.  It is not sustainable into the future.  Universities cannot survive, depend on or be sustainable on the core funding they are receiving from the Government.  If I were to pick any issue out of all the issues that have been raised in our submission, it would have to be funding and the sustainability of universities and third level education into the future.  We cannot do this in a real, sustainable way unless we have proper funding.

They will still be stretched, which is a significant problem for us.<\/p> <p>  On the link with business, there is no hard data on researchers and what is happening with regard to primary and applied research.

I would like to touch on a couple of points.  The first is ensuring that the voices of students and staff are heard, and that there is adequate and meaningful representation of students and staff on governing bodies and they are consulted on and listened to in the different processes.<\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the governing authority and the number of union representatives on it.  I acknowledge that there is a difference between being a student representative and being a governor of an institution, be that a university, a college or whatever.  In terms of higher education institutions, they often set values and strategic priorities which pertain to students, including student well-being, engagement, sustainability, equality, diversity and inclusion, which are important areas for students in terms of input.  Students will be able to have their say and encourage and further the mission and purpose of the higher education institution.<\/p><p> There is one other concern I would like to raise.  With this Bill we have an opportunity to look at how we define and pigeonhole higher education.  It is important for all of us to remember that education is a right, not a privilege.  Students should have access to education and be aided and supported in that entry through sustainable funding to allow them to be able to progress to education and also to be able to continue in the lifelong journey around education.<\/p><p> I again thank the committee for this opportunity.  I remind everyone that with this Bill we have a real opportunity to review how we think about education and how as a country and society we define the purpose of higher education.

We are pleased to host this meeting, given that this is the final week of our parliamentary term and members and I were keen to have an opportunity to engage with our guests, however briefly, in order to allow them to update us on current matters within the Irish immigrant community.  We are pleased to meet this afternoon with Ms Aileen Leonard Dibra, Ms Celine Kennelly, who joins us from San Francisco, Mr. Michael Collins from Chicago, Mr. Ronnie Millar of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers in Boston, and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Staunton of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  Apologies have been received from Senators Wilson and &Oacute; Donnghaile.<\/p> <p>  Our guests are welcome.  They are joining us from the United States.  I thank them for agreeing to meet us at this early hour.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear opening statements from them - I believe Ms Leonard Dibra will lead off - before going into a questions and answers session with members.  We are time limited due to Covid restrictions, so I ask that witnesses be conscious of time constraints in their initial addresses so as to allow some time for questions from members.  I ask members to be concise in their questions in order to allow everyone an opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction be complied with immediately.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, which is the case for all of our witnesses today, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  However, I do not expect any of these issues to arise in our discussions.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State - in their case, the United States of America - are advised to be mindful of their domestic law and how it will apply to evidence given to our committee.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex or in the Convention Centre Dublin where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting in plenary session today.<\/p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented Covid circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us in the event of technical issues of an adverse nature arising.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that Ms Leonard Dibra and her colleagues have joined us.  I will give her the floor and ask her to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071300002#A00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":979,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to meet it and to provide an overview of the work of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers as well as to discuss the current state of immigration in the United States.  The coalition was established in 1996 to promote the welfare of Irish immigrants and serve as the umbrella organisation for Irish immigration centres throughout the United States.  The coalition has 11 member centres from coast to coast that provide a unique array of services, outreach and assistance to Irish immigrants, prioritising confidentiality and cultural competency.  The coalition strives to be a strong, cohesive and representative voice for the needs of its membership and the Irish diaspora at large.  Through ongoing and generous support from the Government of Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs's emigrant support programme, the coalition collaborates with its membership to examine the needs of the Irish diaspora.  Furthermore, the coalition supports its members to enhance the direct service work they provide to the Irish community by looking at best practice, information sharing, data collection, national reporting and the distribution of current accurate and reliable information in the areas of, for example, immigration services, J1 visa programming and professional learning.<\/p><p> Over the past four years, the coalition has led a highly successful and collaborative immigration analysis initiative in partnership with the Embassy of Ireland, Washington, DC, which was supported by a strategic diaspora fund of the Irish Government's then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The programme has facilitated the provision of crucial and pertinent information on immigration policy changes and their impact on the Irish diaspora during the Trump Administration, and continues to do so now under the Biden Administration.  As the embassy designated point of contact for current, accurate and reliable information for the Irish community, the coalition has produced and distributed: 38 community information advisories to the wider Irish community; 16 background documents providing in-depth analysis of immigration policy changes for use by the embassy and consulates, as well as Ministers and other Government officials; and 15 internal immigration briefings that streamlined information and accompanying resources for use by coalition membership as well as consular and embassy offices while providing support to clients.  Finally, with the onset of Covid-19, the immigration analysis programme accordingly expanded its purview to include community information pieces on international travel protocols, federally mandated mask-wearing, vaccination information and member centre services.<\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. Stalhl, will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aileen Leonard Dibra","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":981,"content":"<p>The inauguration of the Biden Administration brought with it a collective sense of relief after four years of high anxiety and concern for immigrant communities, the Irish included, and particularly the undocumented community, due to the Trump Administration's hostile rhetoric on deportation, strict enforcement and anti-immigrant policy changes.  However, Trump era policies continue to affect the country under the Biden Administration and the ongoing impact and aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact on the US immigration system.  In particular, the presidential proclamation suspending travel from certain regions, including Ireland, and the shutdown of the US embassies and consular offices overseas are producing the widest ramifications.<\/p> <p>  The travel suspension has produced consequences on both sides of the Atlantic.  First, temporary visa holders currently in the US have essentially been stranded here without the ability to return to Ireland, renew their visa at the embassy and successfully re-enter the United States.  Further issuance of new visas for people in Ireland has almost stopped completely and the US Embassy is not scheduling visa appointments for those seeking temporary visas under the premise that these individuals, with some limited exceptions, cannot otherwise travel from Ireland to the United States.<\/p> <p>  Immigration restrictions due to Covid-19 have created massive backlogs for consular appointments overseas, as well as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS, domestic adjudications.  It is estimated that it could take years to address these backlogs, particularly at overseas diplomatic posts, and although proposals have been made to address the backlogs, much will depend on the new policies initiated by the Biden Administration and additional funding to increase capacity at these agencies.<\/p> <p>  President Biden introduced his US Citizenship Act 2021 in January.  It was subsequently introduced in both houses of Congress.  This is a comprehensive measure that highlights legalisation for the large undocumented population in the US, and looks to expand and reform the pathway for legal immigration moving forward.  To date, there has been no movement on the Bill in either the House or the Senate, and the likelihood of any Bill passing the Senate with the filibuster in place is improbable.  Within this context, the current approach is piecemeal immigration reform Bills through the budget reconciliation process, which only requires a simple majority to pass.  However, there is a lack of agreement on what should be included in these smaller Bills as well as what populations would receive benefits.<\/p> <p>  I will pass to Mr. Millar on the J1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Stahl"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":982,"content":"<p>There are three types of J1 visa programmes.  These are: the J1 summer work and travel, which is a four-month programme; the J1 intern, which is 12 months' long and interns need a placement before they arrive in the United States; and the J1 Irish work and travel, which is a 12-month visa with which Irish students can land in the United States and have four months to find a placement.  All J1 visa programmes were suspended in April 2021 and thousands of young Irishmen and Irishwomen have lost out on the opportunity to come to the United States over the past two years.  However, the Unites States Department of State has ended this suspension of the J1 visa programme and moving forward, Irish students and graduates will now be able to apply for their visas.  Travel restrictions and visa processing delays at the US Embassy in Dublin present uncertainty as to when J1 students will be able to commence their exchange visitor programmes and start their internships in the United States.  The delay in processing has resulted in some prospective applicants becoming ineligible due to the programme timelines.<\/p> <p>  Employers here in the US are keen to resume hiring Irish graduates, especially for the 12-month programme.  The summer programme has not occurred for the past two years because of Covid-19.  Local businesses in areas such as San Diego, Cape Cod and Chicago are reporting a negative financial impact on all of the seasonal businesses that is directly related to the lack of J1 students available to work during the summer months.<\/p> <p>  The J1 visa programme has been an important rite of passage for tens of thousands of young Irishmen and Irishwomen.  It contributes substantially to the transatlantic business and cultural relationship between Ireland and the United States.  In fact, many of us, the coalition's board of directors, participated in the J1 programme.  The programme is really a win, win, win.  It is a win for Irish students who gain intercultural and international experience, for US businesses which are able to increase the seasonal workforce, and also for Irish businesses as these graduates can return to Ireland with skills and leadership and a more diverse and global mind set.

As my colleague said, the ongoing and pervasive anti-immigrant rhetoric of the previous Administration created particular fear and anxiety among the Irish undocumented community, resulting in a pulling away from centres and their essential programmes and services.  The undocumented retreated further under the radar, becoming further isolated from the community.<\/p> <p>  In addition to systemic concerns, many undocumented Irish work in construction, hospitality and other service-oriented professions.  The pandemic and associated year-long shutdown resulted in loss of employment, diminished savings and crisis situations for these individuals, who were also excluded from US governmental benefits, such as unemployment and federal pandemic relief moneys.<\/p> <p>  Coalition membership reported an increase in inquiries from undocumented individuals and families looking to return to Ireland during the pandemic as a last resort, with the pandemic being the last straw for many of them.<\/p> <p>  The coalition member centres transitioned extremely quickly to remote work and virtual programming to facilitate the continuation of all essential programmes including immigration, social services and senior services.  In addition to regular programmes, the centres also provided emergency support services and hardship fund distribution to assist those most impacted by the pandemic.  Centres opened food pantries, increased contact hours and partnered with respective local and state agencies and organisations to advocate for increased financial support for the most vulnerable in the community, especially the undocumented.<\/p> <p>  Centres across the country also continue to work with local government and community partners to implement essential support programmes in their regions.

I was listening to the piece on the J1 visa.  My children had such a wonderful time in the United States with the J1 visa programme.  After they graduated from college, my son worked in the United States for one of the hotel companies.  He was brought back after he qualified and he played golf on all of the top courses in the United States.  He stayed in Marriott hotels right across the US .  The relationship that Ireland has with the US through J1 visa programme is something else.  I thank the witnesses for their work on that and for the support they offer to all young students when they go over there.  A negativity existed during the last Administration and I hope that we see this reversed and the relationship develop again.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on a sore subject where many Irish feel so hard done by, which is the undocumented Irish.  My great friend and former Senator Billy Lawless put it in a nutshell when he said that they are illegal immigrants in that country.  We need to do everything we can to ensure that they stop taking the risk and they start trying to emigrate in a legal way.  It hurts me greatly to hear people talk about the undocumented Irish and yet we have thousands in this country whose residency in Ireland we are not prepared to legitimise.  We need to play this game evenly.  We need to have a campaign to explain to people that if they are going to emigrate to the United States, they need to do it legally.  They need to touch base with organisations such as the coalition before they go in order that they know exactly what boxes need to be ticked in order to arrive over there legally.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  There are also issues for those expatriates who have gone from Ireland to America to senior positions.  These people are working for some of the major multinationals in the pharmaceutical and technology areas, and yet their children who are born and reared in Ireland cannot return to Ireland to go to university without paying full fees.  Given the relationship we have had with the United States and the huge interconnectedness between the two countries, we must work on this jointly to service the Irish expatriates.  From the few times I have been in the United States, I am aware that the expatriates over there do a fantastic job for the Irish community who arrive in the United States.  We do them a great disservice by not looking after their children when it comes to third level education.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Kennelly for her statement on the wellness issue.  I cannot imagine what it must be like to be a young person or a person in middle age, living in the United States of America to find that a parent, a sibling or a relation in Ireland is terminally ill, or that some catastrophe has happened at home.  These people must sit their time out and cannot move because if they did come home, they would not be going back.  So many of them have their lives set up there.  Maybe I am talking out of both sides of that argument in that on the one side, I am saying that they really need to stop becoming illegal while on the other, I am saying it is great that Ms Kennelly has a wellness initiative set up over there.<\/p> <p>  Will Ms Kennelly indicate if there anything the coalition needs from us to improve the service it provides for our people on the ground and to assist it in the job it is doing?  Perhaps Ms Leonard Dibra will deal with the issue of the expatriates sending their children home.  Mr. Collins and Mr. Stahl might address the concerns on the J1 visa and the undocumented Irish.  I really appreciate the witnesses being here.

Last January to was a headline in one of the publications over there that the immigration reform Bill could see more than 20,000 undocumented Irish given a route to citizenship.  Is there any idea of the numbers?  I am aware that a lot of the people may not be known or may not have made themselves known but the coalition may have a handle on how many people are over there.<\/p> <p>  As a previous speaker has said, could witnesses give us an idea of a breakdown of ages and how long people have been there?

If there is anything the committee can do to assist there, we would like to know about that.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the issue of Irish people who want to visit the United States of America.  Currently there is a complete ban but questions have been asked about people who have been vaccinated in Ireland.  Many of us have been vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which I understand is not recognised in the United States.  If and when the ban might be eased, which hopefully will be soon, has there been any discussion on the recognition of vaccines with regard to people from Europe who want to travel to America to visit family there?

It was very informative.  I commend them on the ongoing work they are engaged in.  Like Senator Craughwell, my eldest daughter had the honour of availing of a J1 visa and spent a very happy time in San Diego a number of years ago.  She built up strong relationships and friendships as a result of that.  It is almost seen as a rite of passage for many young people now.<\/p> <p>My first question concerns the J1 visa programme and the serious backlog as a result of some of the Covid measures within the United States Embassy.  With regard to engagement with the embassy, when might they be on top of the backlog?  What measures have been put in place to deal with the backlog?  I appreciate that the embassy officials are working under extremely difficult challenges, which are presented to everyone, even with the other visas.  The embassy staff have been working remotely, which has had a serious impact on their ability to process any visas.  What engagement has taken place and what kinds of assurances or commitments have been given around processing those?<\/p><p> The issue of emigrants returning to Ireland has presented itself as a challenge for many families that have come back to Ireland after spending many years in the US.

Has that cropped up as an issue in any of the witnesses' engagements with Irish people?<\/p><p> The final issue I wish to raise is those who are undocumented.  Following on from some of the comments made, it is a serious issue that faces more than 20,000 Irish people who are living in the US.  They face serious challenges continuously, but particularly in the past 18 months or thereabouts, in accessing the services and supports they should or could have been able to access in the US, were they fully recognised.  In light of the coming to office of a new President in President Biden, what hopes are there or what engagements have taken place to date with a view to trying to address that serious issue, which, unfortunately, has not been dealt with for far too long?  Given President Biden's strong Irish connections and roots, there is a hope the issue will finally be dealt with comprehensively.

That is what leads to the issues of the undocumented here, unfortunately.  The build-up results from the way the system is currently shaped, which is that if you do come to the US and overstay your visa, you are, in a sense, trapped in the US, because if you depart the US after an overstay, you are barred from then returning.  That then forces most people to have to remain in the US and hope for a change or a pathway to open up, of which a few are available for some in the US who have overstayed.  As there are not many such options currently, however, it forces people to get stuck in the US.<\/p> <p>  Now, with the pandemic and the Covid-19 restrictions that are in place, it is also impacting legal immigrants in the US, that is, those who are in the US on proper temporary work visas or student visas.  They are not able to travel outside the country or go back home and they cannot travel back with the bans currently in place.  They are legally doing the right thing, yet they are still trapped in the US and are unable to travel home for funerals or weddings and such.  Hopefully, a logical system will be set up that is based more on science, rather than just a strict ban, which will allow people to go home if they can show proof of a negative test result.  They already have to show proof of a negative test result to come back to the US.  Everyone - citizens, green card holders and visa holders - have to show proof of a negative test result to return.  However, showing proof of vaccination seems to be the next logical step for those people.  Hopefully, that answers the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071300002#D00475","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Stahl"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":998,"content":"<p>I am conscious that our colleague, Mr. Staunton, is also in attendance.

In respect of jobs, there is some interest in agricultural workers and those who want to work in that area.  There is an interest those in the hi-tech business.  There is some interest in the dreamers, that is, those who came over when they were young.  There is very little interest in others than those, with the general amnesty as they call it.  <\/p> <p>  There is a very tight balance in the House.

As Ms Leonard Dibra said, the range of what we do is significant.  Covid-19 has brought many issues to the forefront and has exacerbated a lot of the mental health and wellness issues that many of our community members see.  We are not just talking about in the undocumented community, which has been the primary focus for many of the immigration centres, but we are also seeing those issues across the gamut.  They are impacting visa holders, undocumented immigrants, green card holders and US citizens.  Covid has created a sense of distance.  Many of our community members lost family members during the pandemic, some from Covid-related illness and most not.  It has certainly created an increased need for programming at our end.<\/p> <p>  One of the most important things that the centres provide is cultural competency when it comes to social service programming.  We can all safely say that the Irish are not the best at seeking assistance, mental health and wellness services, or opening up to hard conversations.  The availability of Irish centres means that there is an Irish voice at the end of the phone or there is somebody who, if they do not have an Irish accent, will greet people seeking support with an Irish saying.  It allows the callers to know they are coming into a safe space, almost as if they are coming home.  Some centres refer Irish people in need of support onward and other centres provide services in-house.  Both models work well and are successful.<\/p> <p>  The best support committee members and Oireachtas Members can provide is through continued funding to allow us to continue to provide services.  They must also support the organisations in Ireland, including the Crosscare Migrant Project, Safe Home Ireland and the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas.  All of those service organisations are partners of all of the centres of the United States.  It is important to ensure they also remain supported.<\/p> <p>  On the question about people returning to Ireland, there is a challenge for access to services.  Mr. Staunton has also raised this matter and he might jump in with any comments in that regard.  Access to driver's licences is an issue.  There are also issues with regard to insurance, opening bank accounts and accessing healthcare.  At the moment, we are working with a number of families who, for a variety of reasons, would be better off at home.  They would have support systems, family and friends around them at home.  Some of those people are going home with significant health issues and in need of additional support that is not available to them in the United States.  Having those support services on the ground is extremely important.  Mr. Staunton may have something to add on people who are returning to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Celine Kennelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>Ms Kennelly has covered the issue well.

The Government needs to look at it from the point of view that those are Irish people who are returning.  They have been away for a while but they are not foreigners.

They expanded their hours and increased cultural programming so that people in the community who were further isolated, whether undocumented or documented, were tied back to the centres.

The embassy in Washington DC partnered with the local consular regions and the 11 centres to provide emergency support to Irish emigrant families who were struggling because of Covid.  They were struggling financially.  People had lost their jobs.  In the early days of Covid, many people were in the construction industry which had really shut down.  This time last year, the hospitality sector was wiped out for more than a year.  Many people had lost their jobs and needed help with rent and food.<\/p> <p>  The best example of this was probably in New York.  A number of Irish organisations and businesses came together and formed the Sl&aacute;inte 2020 coalition to provide emergency relief and cash assistance.  We are indebted to the Irish Government for supporting the welfare of Irish immigrants who really struggled.  Many of the centres ran food pantries and cash assistance programmes.  They checked in with families, particularly older people.  The Irish pastoral centre in Boston supported older Irish people as did many other centres.  This was critical and I thank the embassy in particular.  Every month, we had calls with the ambassador and all of our consuls general.  There was a real sense of solidarity through Covid at real time of crisis.  In Massachusetts, we were part of a multicultural coalition of immigrant support centres.  We were able to get funding from private foundations that were able to help Irish immigrants in Massachusetts with emergency cash assistance.<\/p> <p>  We have also been part of racial justice.  Many of the centres have been very active on the multicultural piece in the United States.  There has been a real racial reckoning.  This has been an important part of the past year.

In Illinois, we run the Illinois family support programme, which is a direct cash assistance programme.  This might have been replicated in other areas in the country.  At the onset of the pandemic, direct Covid relief was a very important part of our work.  It continued to be a very important part of our work throughout the duration of winter and a little bit into spring.  Things are improving slightly.  This all comes down to local shutdowns.

I have been very much aware for a long time of Ciaran Staunton's work and have spoken to him by telephone in the past.  What the witnesses are doing is great.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted that the J1 visas are coming back.  I hope this can be expedited.  My youngest son aspires to one for next year.  It is an important rite of passage.  My son will be very disappointed if he does not have it for next year.  At present, my office is dealing with a student who got a place in Springfield University but cannot get the relevant visa processed by the embassy in Dublin in time for the first semester.<\/p><p>That is a real issue.  If it is an issue for the person dealing with my office, that person, obviously, is by no means alone.  We are doing everything - contacting the embassy, etc. - but it seems the best on offer is something like November.  I do not know whether the witnesses can do anything about that or comment on it.<\/p><p> The undocumented Irish are a subject that is really dear to all our hearts in that it involves people not being able to return for funerals, weddings or other family events, and there is a huge amount of emotional trauma and distress there.  I have heard through my office from a few people who are undocumented and were caught.  They were silly enough to leave New York state but then went to hell and back with custody, being held over, delayed flights and, basically, a lack of civil liberties, you could say, and abuse for a period before being deported.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to comment on that or how widespread it is.  Obviously, I do not want to cite the individual case but it was a pitiful example.  We are concerned, obviously, about access for the undocumented Irish.  Could the witnesses comment more on the status of the E3 visa situation?  There were hopes, because it seems Australia does not take up the full numbers, that a considerable number of E3 visas could be available to our undocumented if they could be got on stream.  The witnesses might elaborate on that, where we are at or what they could do about that specifically.<\/p><p> I salute what the witnesses did about the welfare for people who could not access the normal support systems during Covid.  Could they comment on numbers in that regard?  That has to have been a traumatic position for anybody not to be able to avail of state support yet to be displaced from his or her job.  I may not have heard Mr. Staunton correctly but I think he attempted to outline some of the measurements or figures on the undocumented Irish.  I thought I heard a figure of 5,000.  Mr. Staunton might revert to those figures a little at some point if he does not mind so we hear what he thinks the figures are now.<\/p><p> Turning to the people who are documented, there should not be a great need there.  Perhaps the witnesses would like to comment a little more on the impact of Covid and displacement on those people in the context of jobs and what kind of welfare was needed.<\/p><p> I salute the work the witnesses do.

If Covid has shown us anything, it has really rocked us to our core and exposed how reliant we are on friends and family.  When you are away from home or in a foreign country, that lack of familiarity can be extremely unsettling, and this during such a challenging time.  I commend the work the witnesses have been doing with the Irish in America and congratulate them on the men's shed.  I hope it takes off.  I know men's sheds have been a hugely positive experience here.  Also, I thank all the witnesses for sharing their experience and their knowledge.  There really is no substitute for hearing from people on the ground what the Irish are experiencing abroad.<\/p> <p>  I will not go back over what other contributors have said but I do want to hone in on just a couple of points.  One is the US Citizenship Act of 2021.  Mr. Stahl mentioned that there is a lack of agreement as to what should be included in the smaller Bills.  Can he give us some more details on that?  What at this point in time are proving to be the biggest barriers to the smaller bills that need to be passed?<\/p> <p>  As for the undocumented community, Mr. Collins stated: \"The undocumented retreated further under the radar, becoming further isolated from the community.\"  Has that started to change with the roll-out of vaccinations and the easing of restrictions?  Are those people coming back?  All illegal immigrants, from any country, come with a certain level of vulnerability.  When there is a centre from which they can obtain support, to hear they are pulling away and retreating from that I find very concerning.  Are these people starting to come back to the centres for supports?  Do the witnesses know whether there is access to vaccines for our undocumented in America and what the uptake, if any, is at the moment?<\/p> <p>  Finally, the issue of families seeking to return to Ireland is something the committee needs to come back on and have a look at.  I refer not only to those returning from the United States.  In many ways our system here is very antiquated and could do with being updated to recognise that when people leave the country they will not always be gone for their entire lives and may come back.  I just do not think we have the systems in place here, and I speak of this from experience.  I know personally two people who have had to come back from the United States in the past 12 months, and the difficulties they have experienced are mind-blowing.  They do not reflect very well on our system.<\/p> <p>  I will leave it at that.

I will revert to Ms Leonard Dibra.  As I do, I will put a couple of issues to the witnesses, acknowledging the great work the coalition of centres does and all the centres do daily, servicing a most important need.  Mr. Stahl in one of his replies touched on the fact that the centres are dealing now with perhaps more issues than just Irish issues, with particular reference to campaigns on racial justice.  I am not sure to what extent Ms Leonard Dibra will be in a position to share with us her thoughts on the broadening of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres over the years, acknowledging the tremendous work over decades.  As for 2021 and dealing with issues that are perhaps no longer exclusively Irish issues, I will address myself specifically to Mr. Staunton, acknowledging his work as the chair of Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform over a long number of years, taking a position of great leadership.  Is he more optimistic now than on the last few occasions on which we spoke about finally achieving clear pathways to residency if not pathways to citizenship?  I refer to the draft bill as published by President Biden earlier in the year and the extent to which Mr. Staunton sees a collaborative approach towards amendments that might be of benefit to our people, with particular reference to timeframe.  How does he see that working out, having regard to the fact that he said he does not see any immediacy or any date on which the Bill might be submitted for debate or formally?  I acknowledge the Taoiseach's discussions with President Biden on St. Patrick's Day on prioritising the legislation and, more particularly, the discussions the Taoiseach had over the St. Patrick's weekend on the E3 visa Bill with Speaker Pelosi.  Has Mr. Staunton been in a position to follow up with Dan Mulhall, our ambassador, or other contacts he may have on the Hill?  My question, really, is how optimistic Mr. Staunton is.<\/p> <p>  One technical question came up in the context of a reply from, I think, Mr. Stahl when he spoke about the J1, acknowledging that there is no clear date for resumption and that there is a lack of clarity.  Senator Craughwell, Deputy Brady and Senator O'Reilly declared an interest.  Let me declare my interest insofar as my two daughters enjoyed thoroughly J1 stints in Washington and Boston which, I have no doubt, really formed them in their own personalities and assisted them on their return in their careers.<\/p><p>One has only got to look to this committee to see the importance of J1 visas for the tens of thousands of Irish people.  Is there anything that we can do on this end in order to assist in the return of the J1 visa programme?  Mr. Stahl spoke about the 12-month period after graduation.  I notice some technical confusion here in a number of cases.  Is it 12 months after graduation or 12 months after completion of a course?

Regardless of the figures, let us get on with it.  They are Irish people so let us help them out.  That is where that came in.<\/p> <p>  On the E3 visas, they are leftovers from the Australian E3 visas.  This is a bilateral agreement between Australia and America.  Since Australia was not choosing all of the E3 visas, some of our people and the embassy and others came up with the idea that perhaps Ireland could avail of the unused visas.  The leadership came together with Irish America and the embassy.  It was agreed with Speaker Pelosi and the Senate leadership that instead of opting for legislation, they would put it through on a unanimous consensus voice vote.  That means no one can object.  Congressman Richard E. Neal, my friend from Springfield, brought it to the House in March 2020.  It was all set to go through the Senate.  Everyone in both parties had agreed to it.  Then, Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas, pulled out the \"No\" vote to stop it.  One &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote is all it takes.  That means it did not get out there.  We had to allow time to filter before last time to see if there was some way we could get Senator Cotton to walk back his &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote for a future run at it.  Prior to this, we had the same issues with Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa.  He just put up a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.  That is all they have to do, and then everything is dead.  We hope that there will be a road to Damascus for Senator Cotton.  Anyone who follows him says that they do not know how much prayer it will take to turn him.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for all of his work.  We have dealt with him before.  The atmosphere at the time when he was in the United States was fairly difficult.  We think that the atmosphere has improved.  We have dealt with President Biden over the past 20 or 30 years in Dublin, in the US Embassy in Ireland and with the leadership.  He was down in Mayo last year.  There are many great contacts there.  Unfortunately, it has to come through the legislative process in the House of Representatives and the Senate.  The Senate is tied 50-50.  For most things to get through, they need 60 votes.  That means they need the agreement of ten Republicans for everything.  They can hardly even get them in respect of the construction world at the moment.  That is good money going back into constituencies.<\/p> <p>  I would never want to say that I am not positive, because no pessimist ever came to America.  However, it will take a lot of turning again in the fall, after they come back and get those couple of Bills through.  Whether or not they will go with a grand Bill in the form of an immigration reform Bill, which includes agriculture workers, the dreamers and some of the other ones, along with the others who are there.

Those with F student visas and M student visas are exempt under the regional travel ban.  They are able to travel if they have a visa in place.  The issue, though, is getting a new visa or renewing a visa at the moment because of the backlogs at the US Embassy in Dublin.  The difficulty is there.  They are prioritising those visas, among other things.  The problem is that they do not have as many appointment slots as they usually would.  The difficulty is getting people in within the timeframes that are needed.  Most of these students seem to be working closely with their schools to set up alternate arrangements on a remote basis.  As a plan B, some who are not able to get through will attend school remotely, from within Ireland, for the initial part of the semester.  It does not seem like everybody will have the opportunity to get into the US Embassy in Ireland before the end of the summer to process these visas.<\/p> <p>  I also wanted to say that New York State, in its recent budget, passed a few relief measures for undocumented people in the form of rent assistance and an emergency relief fund.

We will be helping those people.  That will bring many individuals forward to seek that financial assistance.

As all of my colleagues have referenced in the context of access to vaccines and information, there was a heightened level of fear.  The individual centres and the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers played a very important role in communicating with communities and making sure they were aware there was a safe space to which they could come and people to whom they could speak about issues of concern to them.  To be fair, all the centres deserve kudos for that.  Their doors were open.  Virtual programming was put in place in a flash.  Those of us who previously knew nothing about Zoom became very proficient in it by the end of April 2020.  The centres have continued to operate in that realm for the past 12 months.  We have created several new elements of programming.  The centre in Chicago and our centre here in San Francisco organised immigration question and answer sessions with our local consulates.  More than 100 people joined those hour-long presentations which provided information and an update regarding what was happening with regard to Covid, Ireland, travel and vaccination.  We have all worked to our collective strengths in making sure people know information is available, current and correct and that our doors are open to receive questions.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked regarding the impact of Covid on the documented community.  As Mr. Stahl referenced, travel stopped for many members of the documented community.  For the past 12 months, the only people who have been able to travel to Ireland and return, for any reason, are US citizens, that is, those of us who have dual citizenship, or green card holders.  Many visa holders were used to having the ability to come and go and being able to have that touch back to home.  Several members of the committee mentioned the importance of that touch back to home, of coming back to family and friends and being able to regroup.  It is very important that the symbiotic relationship that exists between Ireland and America is maintained and that we have a free flow between our two countries.  Many of the documented living in the United States got a very sharp taste of what it is like not to be able to move freely or to travel over and back.  In many cases, they got a taste of what it is like to be a member of the undocumented community who, to answer an earlier question, would do anything in their power to regularise their status.  I can safely say that all undocumented immigrants living in the United States would do anything possible to regularise their status.  Unfortunately, as has been mentioned, we struggle to find the path for them to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021071300002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Celine Kennelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kennelly.  I will circle back to her comments regarding the immigration clinics and whatnot that carried on virtually.<\/p><p>To highlight something we mentioned in our statement, the coalition's immigration analysis initiative is thankful to its partners at the embassy in Washington DC who, with the onset of the Trump Administration four years ago, came together with generous funding from the then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to make this happen.  The centres do a magnificent job of answering the questions of members of the Irish community who come to them.  I am pleased to say that we at the coalition on the national level feed that information into the centres.  My partner, Mr. Stahl, walks me through the legal side of everything input from the centres, which have magnificent legal minds working for them.  It is a real national effort.  We have been able to streamline information, let the Irish community know that this is where people will get accurate and reliable information, to educate themselves and to go to the centres to get the support necessary to make the best and most educated decisions for themselves, based on their personal immigration cases.  <\/p><p> I would welcome members of the committee to follow the coalition.  We post and distribute everything publicly for the most part, on our social media, in order that people have access to it.  We would welcome it were members to see what we are doing and perhaps we will send the committee a follow up on some of the work we have done in the past four years.  Feedback has been great from our members and support from them in distributing that information to their regional clients has been fantastic.  Our partnership with the embassy is priceless.  The support from the consular offices who feed into and use the materials also is really great.  I wanted to highlight that because it is a significant programme that we do and it is very helpful.  <\/p><p> One of the last questions was from the Chair looking at the diverse diaspora.  I think it is something that we have done very well stateside for a number of reasons.  We have some social justice work going on here outside of the coalition, within our own cultural context.  In keeping with the diaspora strategy, as well as the immigrant support programme that highlights looking at non-traditional diaspora members, the coalition through our social services committee is now looking closely at inclusivity and how to look at different areas of the Irish diaspora that our centres serve, whether it be racial diversity or the LGBTQ+ community, who all make up the amazing Irish diaspora here in the United States.  We are happy to be doing that work and happy to continue that work.

All the organisations work in partnership with other non-Irish immigrant support centres.  A big part of what has happened during Covid-19 is that we have come together as an Irish community and in partnership with other, non-Irish organisations.  It makes me really proud to be able to say that I am Irish and working alongside other immigrant groups.  I want to clarify and emphasise that any funding that came for welfare support was absolutely for Irish families and supported Irish families.  The reality is that race is the dominant conversation we are having right now, around racism.  It is really important for us as Irish men and women in the United States to be standing up and speaking out against racism.  That has been a big part of our identity.  We are partnered in Boston with the Irish Network Boston which was business leaders and other Irish organisations.  We ran online conversations about racism and systemic racism and that has been an important part of our experience of being Irish in America.

Certainly, Ms Leonard Dibra and her team have left us in doubt as to the importance of this engagement.  I thank her again and acknowledge the work that the coalition manages right across through California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Philadelphia and Washington D.C.<\/p> <p>  It is also timely that we have this meeting now because as we break for the summer, the focus will be heading towards budgetary matters in September, and of course the Department of Foreign Affairs budget, and support under the emigrant support programme, ESP, as well as various other headings, are issues which are important to us in the committee.

We certainly hope that the positive relationship between the Department of Foreign Affairs and our Government and your coalition will continue and will be manifest in the budget for the ESP and associated programmes.  It appears to me that the Covid-19 response fund has been put to very good use and even though we are moving towards the end of Covid-19, hopefully, it seems to me from our engagement that there still is a requirement for Covid-19 funding through your centres.  I want to acknowledge the positive relationship between yourself and our consular team across the United States of America.  That is crucially important to us, as parliamentarians, and indeed to all Irish people.  In fact, the connection is such that our current consul in Boston is Dr. Laoise Moore, who was policy officer to this committee not long ago, and I would be grateful if you would pass on the regards of the committee to Dr. Moore, and thank her for her work and indeed acknowledge all the work of our consuls and their team across the United States.<\/p> <p>  As well as thanking you, I want to acknowledge that we have more work to do.  It is important that we would meet again before the end of the year.  We have work to do in terms of the immigration issue, listening closely to what Mr. Staunton has said about possible timeframes and the need to ensure active engagement on the part of our people in Washington D.C., including Ambassador Mulhall, with your group.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Our engagement this morning is with Mr. John McCallister, former MLA for the Ulster Unionist Party and NI21 who also sat as an Independent Member, Ms Anna Mercer, public affairs consultant with Stratagem, and Professor Jon Tonge, professor of politics, University of Liverpool.  The witnesses were nominated by Ms Claire Hanna MP under our agreed procedures for deciding who to bring in.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the witnesses to today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  I will now read the notice on privilege.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.<\/p> <p>  I will call the witnesses in alphabetical order to give their three-minute opening statements.  It is part of our rules and regulation that we have to wear masks so I ask the witnesses to forgive us for doing so.  I will call on Mr. McCallister.  He will be followed by Ms Mercer and then Professor Tonge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#A00200","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I assume everybody can hear me okay.  I have a few comments and thoughts.  It was with wisdom that the framers of the Good Friday Agreement ensured that a review mechanism was built into the agreement and recognised that those provisions would need adjustment over time in the interests of efficiency and fairness.  At the heart of those provisions was a recognition that political institutions must evolve over time in order to develop and remain secure amid inevitable social, cultural, economic and political change.  Of course, the existence of the review mechanisms also implies recognition that the political architecture of the institutions was designed to deal with the immediate post-conflict context of 1998 and might not remain appropriate for Northern Ireland in the decades to follow.  Despite the political wisdom that shaped those provisions, the political will to act upon them has not always been present, principally in Belfast but also in Dublin and London to some extent.<\/p> <p>  The one serious initiative to reform this architecture was the Private Members' Bill I introduced which became law as the Assembly and Executive Reform (Assembly Opposition) Act (Northern Ireland) 2016.  I knew when I was framing that Bill that it would not only have to garner support but that it represented a legislative mechanism to test what support existed for the various provisions.  Things were certainly removed or significantly diluted.  Like most people trying to pass legislation, I probably set the bar much higher than I expected to reach.  However, I would argue that some of the things we failed to do have come back to bite us and may also affect us in the future.  I refer to things like designation, which I will speak about in a minute, collective Cabinet responsibility and renaming the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister to reflect those particular roles.<\/p> <p>  I will start with collective Cabinet government.  Throughout the process, I argued that we do not have power-sharing but rather power that is shared out.  It is stated in the Irish Constitution that the Government will act as a collective.  It would have been very difficult for Ireland to get through the changes caused by the economic downturn and financial crash without collective Cabinet government.  There are approximately 300 years of convention at Westminster.  Collective Cabinet government broke down during Theresa May's time and we saw the difficulties that caused.  It is essential.  If Government is not acting as a collective, it becomes very difficult for us in Belfast and Northern Ireland to tackle waiting lists and to reform the health service.<\/p> <p>  The designation system is responsible for preventing the emergence of serious and meaningful parliamentary culture.  I understand why it was introduced at the time.  It was necessary to help build in trust.  It almost provided a veto.  However, times have changed and we now have more MLAs who are not designated and who are therefore classed as other.  You have to look at where their votes count in a designated voting system.  That is unfair and not necessarily reflective of the situation.  It brings us back to my point on efficiency and fairness.<\/p><p> We could well be in a position after the next Northern Ireland Assembly election where even more MLAs will refuse to designate as either unionist or nationalist.  Society is moving beyond those labels of unionist and nationalist and people may have strong views on the constitutional position.  There is much more to it.  I believe the designation is a frozen part of time and has probably held the institutions back.  I am of the view that it should be seriously looked at and changed.  The absence of reform has undermined the ability of the assembly and the Executive to govern.  It has undermined the public's perception of the institutions.  For those generations, the terms unionist and nationalist do not adequately or fully define their politics.  Irrespective of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, it is clear that the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement will remain as a means of administering this region.  It is imperative, in the interests of everybody on these islands, that we encourage, promote and facilitate reform of the institution and that we maintain that efficiency and fairness.  Edmund Burke once said: \"A state without the means of some change, is without the means of its own conservation.\"  The failure to reform and to go further has been a blockage and has held us back.<\/p><p> One of the great successes brought about by the assembly was building relationships.  It got people in to talk about the business of government and what concerned their constituents.  Suddenly people were working across parties.  Over the past four and a half years, we have neglected that.  There are probably two good reasons.  One is that the Assembly collapsed in January and February of 2017, so there was a three year back in the assembly running.  Devolution continued but the assembly and the Executive were not in place.  We have now had almost 18 months of virtual working.  That has not been great for building those relationships between MLAs, parties and people working together to get to know each other on a more personal level.  It is much easier to demonise somebody when you do not know them.  I am happy to take questions.  I thank the committee for its time this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCallister","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1052,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to present at it.  My name is Anna Mercer.  I am a senior consultant at Stratagem, which is a Belfast-based public affairs agency.  Based on a paper which I delivered at the MacGill Summer School in 2019, I hope to provide some practical suggestions that could support our politicians to deliver more effective government through institutional and policy reform.  Drawing on the current thinking about the relationship between citizens and the state, alongside the importance of societal, economic and environmental well-being, Northern Ireland has the opportunity to build on both the Good Friday Agreement and the principles and practice of recent innovations such as an outcomes-based programme for Government.<br\/><br\/>I will look first at an overview of institutional review and reforms.  Mark Durkan famously referred to the &quot;ugly scaffolding&quot; of the Good Friday Agreement when describing some of the safeguards installed to protect against abuses, such as community designation, a lack of opposition and the petition of concern.  Over the years, we have seen agreements reached, including the St. Andrew's Agreement, Stormont House Agreement and New Decade, New Approach, which have dealt with some of the aspects that have bottle-necked our politics.  Each of these has responded to a specific crisis.  They have been reactive rather than proactive or strategic.  They have been subject to political negotiations and horse-trading.  These are not the optimal conditions under which we should be reviewing our institutions.  We need to put some oxygen back into this debate, do it away from a crisis, and review the Northern Ireland Act in its entirety to ensure that institutions are fit for purpose in a modern and evolving post-conflict society?  One option when doing this would be to mandate an external body such as a citizens' assembly to deliver this, as has been done in the Republic and across the water.  There is an opportunity to incorporate this into a commitment within New Decade, New Approach to establish this model of deliberative democracy in Northern Ireland.  Other contributors in the committee have looked at this previously.<br\/><br\/>Moving on to public policy reform, getting a strong framework follows on from the need for a renewed institutional framework.  It is critical in setting the tone for good governance.  The prominence and dominance of constitutional politics permeate our public policy.  The extent of the normalisation of this approach is such that it has become an acceptable and sadly often self-fulfilling characteristic of our policy.  We only need to look at our education system for evidence of this.  We need to find a vision that all parties can coalesce around which is nothing to do with constitutional preference and which can unify rather than divide.  There is an opportunity to make this shift through the welcome development of an outcomes-based programme for Government and the centrality of well-being in this approach.  A concept which has promoted by the Carnegie UK Trust for this focus on well-being establishes a more long-term vision that endures beyond electoral cycles, which we need for issues such as climate change, poverty and things which are not just fitted into the electoral cycles, and which is based on a clear, unambiguous ambition to improve the well-being of citizens.  Key to making this work is underpinning it with legislation.  We have seen the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act and the Well-being of Future Generations Act in Wales.  They have been able to implement this legislation.  Legislation was introduced just two weeks ago by Lord Bird, which seeks to introduce this across the UK for reserved matters, but principally for England.  All this legislation has had well-being at its heart.<br\/><br\/>This may also enable a rights-based narrative that is more acceptable for those who are less comfortable with this language.  We know that the rights debate, which has been part of the Good Friday Agreement, has become toxic and unpalatable in some political corners.  If we reframe the debate and change the language around it while maintaining the integrity and the principles to which we committed, we might be able to inject life into the debate again.<br\/><br\/>Accompanying the legislation to underpin the programme for Government, there needs to be a duty to co-operate.  In the same spirit as my proposal on institutional reform, this goes hand in hand with enshrining well-being in policy.  Mr. McCallister talked about collective responsibility.  It does not just happen.  It is about moving people together and integrating rather than having them separate but equal.  A pick-and-mix approach will fail to address the structural requirements that we need to support the policy ambition.<br\/><br\/>How our politicians interact with the institutions has evolved.  An independent, system-wide review is required to consider how the legislation that governs them is fit for purpose and promotes integration and not just equality.  We need to move away from the <i>quid pro quo<\/i>approach that has characterised our politics and our policy and agree a new platform that can sustain the turbulence of governing and which accommodates but does not prioritise our constitutional positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Mercer"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>I call Professor Jonathan Tonge from the department of politics at the University of Liverpool.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#B00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>I thank the committee and Claire Hanna in particular for the invitation.  I am grateful to be able to appear before the committee.  It is a great opportunity to advance a positive case.  For all the naysaying and doom-mongering about the Executive and the assembly, what is remarkable is that the public has remained so supportive of the institutions in the North.  I speak as the director of general elections surveys for Scotland, Westminster and Northern Ireland for the Economic and Social Research Council.  We have tracked public opinion across those four elections.  It is remarkable how the public stuck with the institutions.  When we asked at the June 2017 Westminster election what percentage of the population in the North would want the institutions to come back, it was 70% and only 7% were opposed.  The number in support of the return of the devolved institutions rose between 2017 and 2019.  By the December 2019 Westminster elections, it was at 81%, with only 2% of the population being opposed.  Absence actually made the heart grow fonder of the institutions.  People wanted them back.  They recognise that there is no alternative.  Other options, if you want to call them that, such as direct rule from Westminster, are simply non-runners.<\/p><p>The figure of support for Westminster direct rule has never risen above 12% for any of those options in past election surveys.  The first positive point to make this morning is that the public back the institutions and want devolved power-sharing.<\/p><p> The second important point is that the public backs the principles of cross-community consent for key decisions.  The majorities are not as strong, it should be said, in favour of principles of cross-community consent as they are for the principle of devolved power-sharing, but we still found the majority of unionists and nationalists, and even a slight majority of those who say they are neither unionist or nationalist, back the principle of cross-community consent and the idea that the Executive must contain unionists, nationalists and, indeed, others.  The principles that were there in 1998 that led to the introduction of devolved power-sharing on 2 December 1999 remain intact.  That is not to say, as I will touch upon in a moment, that those communal designations should remain as rigid in the long term.<\/p><p> The other point to make, starting on a positive note, is that the assembly can be an effective legislature.  If one looks at the volume of legislation the assembly passed during its most functioning period, between 2007 and 2016, it was almost the equivalent, in the context of legislative items and Bills passed, of the Scottish Parliament, which has and has acquired substantially more powers since the period of devolution.  There is a very strong case for the Executive and the assembly, and no one has come up with any credible alternative to them.<\/p><p> That said, there are sensible proposals for reform, some of which are very modest and could be usefully made.  The first is a very simple one, namely, to co-badge the titles of First Minister and deputy First Minister.  Michelle O'Neill is not deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland; she is co-First Minister.  It is a simple case of altering the badges.<\/p><p> Second, designation size should be immaterial in the context of who fills these posts.  Why should the size of an overall bloc matter?  I do not like the term \"sectarian silos\", but designation size represents thinking in terms of ethno-national blocs and it permeates appointments at the top.  There is no need for designation size to be a factor in those positions.<\/p><p> My third point - and I do not want to engage in utopianism - is that, as the two previous speakers highlighted, in the longer term there is a case for a fundamental review of the assembly.  As we have just heard, such a review should not be carried out in desperate circumstances where the assembly has collapsed.  There is an argument to make, in the context of the longer term, in favour of getting rid of those communal designations or of only applying them in certain circumstances in respect of what might be designated very key legislation.  It would be up to the MLAs to decide what would constitute key legislation whereby one would register as a unionist or a nationalist, or, rather than using either of those, under the rather reductionist label of \"other\".  Already, 81% of votes in the assembly are taken on the basis of a simple majority.  Cross-community consent is only deployed on a fairly irregular basis.  Why not reflect the way in which those votes are taken in any event through the nature of designations within the assembly?<\/p><p> Other points to make very briefly, recognising that my three minutes are virtually up, is that I have in my statement to the joint committee undertaken some consideration of the legislation that is going through Westminster at the moment, namely, the Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill.  I have some concerns about that Bill because it is a negative one and is all about preventing collapse rather than rethinking the institutions.  It creates greater space and time before the institutions collapse.  My concern with that is that one creates a zombie government of caretaker Ministers with undefined powers in order to prevent collapse.  That does not amount to good governance for the North on anyone's basis, be they unionist, nationalist or other.<\/p><p> I also note that that Bill addresses the issue of petitions of concern.  The vetoes within the petitions of concern are not the big issue for the current assembly.  They were of their time and were over a period when the assembly was of a larger size when parties could realistically expect to win more than 30 seats and could go on solo runs to block measures.  That simply is not the case anymore.  There are other forms of veto that lurk within the Executive and the assembly that are much more important than petitions of concern<\/p><p> I do not have any particular objection to the measures that are going through Westminster at the moment, I welcome the provision in the Bill to which I refer that bolsters the ministerial code.  That is all there in New Decade, New Approach.  My regret about this current legislation is that there is not a great deal more of New Decade, New Approach, which is a very healthy document, in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Jonathan Tonge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>There were some very interesting suggestions there.

A key part of any democracy is getting all people around the table to agree. Everybody recognises that the agreement is not perfect and that changes may be needed but the key question for me is how one gets buy-in from the political parties and from the people of Northern Ireland.  The key to anything, and, in particular, the Good Friday Agreement, because so much work went into it, is that when people get involved in something, one gets the return and the buy-in.  If we are going to establish a citizens&rsquo; assembly, how do we get the political buy-in?  Without it, I would have doubts about how anything that would be brought forward would really stick together.  That is my key question.

Is the lack of additional autonomy, structures and powers crippling the Northern Ireland Assembly?  At present, one party might go to the UK Government on a particular issue and another party will do the same thing in respect of a different issue.  We saw that very recently with the Irish language Act, where those big problems are solved by outside bodies.  Is it the case that more autonomy is needed in order for people to be able to act and react and to get away from an us-versus-them mentality whereby those occupying the middle ground are left out and their voices are not heard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#C00400","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>Mr. McCallister, Ms Mercer and Professor Tonge may reply in whatever order they wish.

That is an excellent point about a citizens' assembly.  Provision is made for the use of a citizens' assembly.  I confess that initially I was cynical about deliberative democracy and citizens' assemblies but then I saw how well they have worked in your own jurisdiction in resolving very tricky problems indeed.  I am a convert and I bring that zeal of the convert to the idea.  There is provision within the New Decade, New Approach agreement for at least one item per year to be resolved via a citizens' assembly.  I stand open to correction, but I believe it is up to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to choose which topic could be put out to a citizens' assembly.  I very much hope to see that implemented because it is there within the devolution restoration deal.  It really ought to be implemented, and I hope it does not fall by the wayside.<\/p> <p>  On the extra powers, one of the problems with the regulatory collapse is that the assembly has been collapsed for 38% of the time since 2 December 1999.  Amidst its good periods, there have, as we know, been really bad periods.  One of the products of this is that the assembly has not acquired any significant new powers with the big exception - and I do not underestimate the importance of it - in 2010 of the devolution of policing and justice.  Given the troubled history of the North, it was a phenomenal achievement to acquire those powers.  The assembly has not acquired powers of any real significance beyond that.  In the context of direct legislative powers, it has actually been overtaken by what was previously the national assembly for Wales and is not the Senedd.  Until the Northern Ireland Assembly gets that stability from a prolonged period of sustained devolved government, it is not going to be given substantial new powers.  It cannot be given that.  It is a question of the sequencing.  Longer term, however, it makes perfect sense to devolve more powers to the assembly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Jonathan Tonge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>It is good to see Senator Blaney.  I congratulate him on his return to the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  As we get buy-in, we can use measures such as citizens' assemblies.  What I have been seeing from the public have been incredibly high levels of support, as mentioned by Professor Tonge.  On some of the key issues, I sense that the public is well ahead of the politicians.  There is certainly buy-in and support.  People want to see good government.  Sometimes one has to manage expectations as to what a government can deliver, but I certainly sense the public appetite to get on.  There are no great alternatives out there, as Professor Tonge pointed out.  Direct rule does not have public buy-in.  What we have, like it or loathe it, is what we have.  The vast majority of the population will know an MLA personally.  As a result, there is a very much a culture of chatting to people and knowing about and supporting local issues, which people like.  All elected colleagues across both jurisdictions know this.<\/p> <p>  Senator McGreehan referred to the lack of powers.  I agree with Professor Tonge's point.  I would very much have been a supporter of devolving tax varying powers to the assembly, but one would have to reform it first.  I would love to see the assembly being more powerful but it must be reformed and functioning.  In my view, that would be a truly collective, functioning government, preferably with an opposition holding it to account.  We went through a period where politics had no consequences, and even the failure and bringing down of the assembly in 2017 had no real impact on the electoral support of the parties.  Consider, for example, the political parties that had to take very difficult decisions ten or 12 years ago.  This had a real impact for them when it came to elections.  We have not had that and it is part of building up an actual parliamentary culture.<\/p> <p>  From a personal perspective, I was very pleased that Professor Tonge mentioned how productive the assembly was between 2007 and 2016, which entirely reflected my membership of it.

One of our tasks was making the case to politicians as to why this would be helpful to the political process and not a hindrance.  That journey was challenging.  There were sceptics at the outset but we did manage to bring most people around.  It was about making the case to the MLAs that we were not trying to replace them or challenge their mandate.  That it is a very positive thing to bring the public in.  All over the New Decade, New Approach agreement is a commitment to civic engagement.  Professor Tonge mentioned the commitment to it.  It may be actually two citizens' assemblies per year, which seems a wee bit ambitious, but we would take one and that would be a great start.  We also referenced how successful these assemblies have been in the Republic on subjects such as marriage equality.  It was a game changer.  The assemblies changed how an issue was perceived.  It is an opportunity to widen the conversation beyond those within the assembly who of course have a bit of a vested interest in sustaining some bits that they like and not others.  We need to take it outside of Stormont.<\/p> <p>  On Senator McGreehan's points around having more devolved powers, I am not sure that it is about the actual powers; I believe it is the processes.  The issues referred to have needed a bit of help, shall we say, from the UK Government, but they have not been reserved issues.  The Irish language Act is not a reserved category, it is just because it has been too hard.  We need to look at the process around how we facilitate policy development here.  I have referred to some of this in my presentation such as the development of a fiscal council, which is another commitment in New Decade, New Approach that will bring better governance to some issues, and particularly around budgetary matters.  We really should be looking towards how we can do this and how we can facilitate these processes.  We have a lot of politics but we do not have a lot of governance.  Of course there is a place for politics, which is so important, but sometimes politics can completely subsume the actual processes and then the issues get lost.  This is why we need the systems and the institutions to reflect that and to have stronger foundations.  The policy-making itself needs to be more robust also to take the heat out of going back to what we know, which is nationalism, unionism and constitutional positions.

Have they had any support from the political parties regarding a citizens' assembly?  Funnily enough, something that came up at our meeting last week with the up-and-coming politicians is that they feel that political decisions which affect the Good Friday Agreement are made behind closed doors and not in the open, when the Good Friday Agreement is the people's agreement.  I am not giving my opinion.  I am asking for more information on the matter.<\/p><p> It was stated that the institutional framework reinforces constitutional politics.  Does that benefit the two main parties and extremes?  Given Mr. McCallister's healthy statistics on how people support power-sharing and Stormont, why does he think that people vote for parties which threaten their collapse or parties involved in the collapse?  With regard to 2016 and the efficiency of the Bills up until that point, nobody has mentioned Brexit.  How much has that played into this?  How much of this is trying to fix local problems based on bigger issues?<\/p><p> As regards the well-being piece, is that similar to what we are doing at present whereby we are changing our measures of success with regard to well-being?  New Zealand is doing it as well, and Scotland has done it.  I am not as familiar with what is happening in Wales and England.<\/p><p> Can we afford not to address community designation in search of more stability and to bring more young people with us?  One thing I came across last week was how effective the councils are at working together.  Do the witnesses see a difference between how the councils work together versus Stormont?  Perhaps the witnesses can give us their views on the petition of concern, the problems involved and the perceived solutions?  That would be useful as well.  I did not mean to ask so many questions, but there is great stuff here and I appreciate the witnesses' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#D00500","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>There are just five minutes left in the slot so I ask the guests to reply in whatever order they wish.

As to whether the citizens' assembly would be strand 1, in an ideal world it would be strand 2 and could be an all-island citizens' assembly.  One can see the obvious political difficulties with that, however.  One would want buy-in support for it from the unionist parties to create an all-island citizens' assembly, but that would be the optimum solution.  It would very much depend upon the topic that was chosen by the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  As Ms Mercer corrected me, one can have up to two citizens' assemblies per year.  I hope they go ahead.  I suspect the first will certainly be strand 1 and will only be for people in the North.  It would be necessary to get a representative sample of those people, but it is perfectly doable as can be seen in this jurisdiction.  There is no reason that it cannot take on very contentious issues such as marriage equality and abortion were, although they might seem entirely uncontentious now.  There is no reason that it could not be replicated in the North.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the review mechanisms, a review mechanism for the Good Friday Agreement is long overdue.  We need a formal review of the Good Friday Agreement every five years.  As to whether it would get rid of the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, not necessarily.  The Good Friday Agreement was a fantastic political document and a conceptual framework for the future when it emerged, but not every clause of the agreement has to remain in stone in perpetuity.  It can be adjusted and adapted.  It was adapted, somewhat controversially, in 2006 with the St. Andrews Agreement, but that was an update that was very necessary to restore devolved power sharing.  There is no reason that one cannot adjust aspects of the Good Friday.<\/p> <p>  As regards decisions taken behind closed doors and alienating young people, one of the biggest problems we have is that only one third of 18-year-olds to 24-year-olds voted at the last Westminster election.  I strongly suspect the figure is very similar for the last Assembly election, although I have not checked it.  People aged between 18 and 24 are less likely to vote in an election on my side of the Irish Sea, full stop, but that is particularly acute in respect of elections in Northern Ireland.  That is a problem.  Young people appear to be disaffected by the type of politics taking place.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Good Friday Agreement and the reinforcement of constitutional politics, the constitutional question is dealt with by the agreement.  Consent, North and South, will be required for constitutional change.  I do not see changes to the Good Friday Agreement affecting that.  I would argue that there are aspects of the Good Friday Agreement that are unsatisfactory in terms of the way it deals with constitutional politics, for example, the criteria by which the Secretary of State shall call a Border poll in the North.  We might want to look at whether they should be clearer.  It seems to be based on whatever the Secretary of State's criteria appear to be on a given day, but the constitutional issue is dealt with in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  On the question of why people vote for parties that threaten its collapse, the obvious, if unsatisfactory, answer is that the voters for those parties would not see their parties as being responsible for those collapses.  It should be said that the collapses of the institutions have been for very different reasons.  The post-conflict reasons for instability between 2002 and 2006 when we had the assembly hiatus are very different from the issues that collapsed the assembly in more recent times.<\/p> <p>  As for Brexit, even if there had been an Executive in place, I do not believe it could have dealt with Brexit.  There were the initial encouraging noises after the Brexit vote when Martin McGuinness and Arlene Foster issued the joint statement talking about the special circumstances in the North that had to be dealt with and addressed in the fallout from Brexit, but soon afterwards the assembly collapsed anyway so there was nothing that could be done in terms of assembly and Executive management of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the question the Senator raised about petitions of concern, I dealt with that in the statement.  I do not believe petitions of concern are the big problem now.  There is an argument for saying that petitions of concern should only be lodged where there is not just two parties but that those parties should be from different designations.  That way one can argue that one is not playing the communal veto game.  However, I do not believe petitions of concern will be a major issue.  I do not see parties adopting petitions of concern as the major veto tactic over the next life of the assembly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Jonathan Tonge"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I must move on to Sinn F&eacute;in.

It is good to see Mr. John McCallister again.  I always thought he was a thoughtful and conciliatory parliamentarian.  In terms of the submissions that are being made, the proposition is that the form of parliamentary assembly or democracy that is in place in the North is satisfactory.<\/p><p>I think we all agree that it is not an ideal scenario.  Ideally, in any democracy, you want a government and an opposition with legislation debated back and forth.  In no normal democracy would the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in be in coalition government together.  They are diametrically opposed on social, economic and constitutional matters.  It is not just a question of whether we should have a united Ireland or a United Kingdom.  We disagree with the DUP on a whole range of matters and would never be in coalition together in a normal democracy but this is not a normal scenario.  I put it to everyone, not only the contributors but all the members of the committee, that the reason we came to this type of Assembly and Executive under strand 1 of the Good Friday Agreement was to reflect the experience particularly of the nationalist community of unionist misrule over many, many years.  We needed to have protections and guarantees for the nationalist community particularly and shared government was what we arrived at.  It is not ideal at all.  It is very regrettable that the civic forum element of strand 1 has been disposed of, that it is not up and running.  It is really healthy to have a citizens' assembly and a civic forum.  It is badly missing in the North.  I would like to believe the members of the committee, TDs, Senators and MPs, would have the humility to accept that we do not have all the wisdom and that there are people in civic leadership who may have a lot to contribute who may be better connected to communities than ourselves, God forbid.  There is definitely a need to put back in place a civic forum-citizens' assembly that could input into the governments.  <\/p><p> Changing the structures will have to be negotiated out.  That will be a very sensitive matter.  We should be open to changes.  As the presentations pointed out, the problem has been that we have made the changes, whether it is the St. Andrews, Stormont or New Decade, New Approach agreements, it is always from a crisis.  It is not proactive, it is responding to a crisis and that is accepted.  Sinn F&eacute;in would like a citizens' assembly to look at the whole issue of Irish unity and a border poll to prepare properly for that.  That is the context in which we would like to see that but it could look at transitionary arrangements and the form of governance we have on the pathway to that border poll or potential Irish unity down the line.  <\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in does use the title of joint First Minister for Michelle O'Neill.  It is correct that it is, in all reality, a position of joint First Minister.  It would be good to have that formalised.  I agree that the criteria for a border poll is very vague and not satisfactory at all.  This committee has corresponded with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland seeking clarification on that.  There are not that many failings in the Good Friday Agreement but that is one of them.<\/p><p> Would Mr. McCallister acknowledge there is a concern in the nationalist community about moving away from firm power sharing protections?  How would he, as a unionist, reach out to the nationalist community and reassure it on those issues in the pathway to change? <\/p><p> Will Professor Tonge and Ms Mercer comment on how we deal with a civic forum?  I would be interested to know why they thought it was removed, and why it has not been put back in place.  I certainly cannot understand that.

It is good to see Mr. McCallister again.  Ms Mercer's opening statement referred to an outcomes-based approach and governance that is essentially fit for purpose.  I was struck by the absence of the economic reality which Stormont is subject to.  Conor Murphy as Finance Minister has set up a fiscal commission to deal with the problem around the inability to budget on a multi-year approach so that we can identify priorities and provide fit-for-purpose governance.  Can Mr. McCallister comment on how having to budget on a year-by-year basis impacts on the points he is making around governance?  <\/p> <p>  In his opening statement provided to the committee, Professor Tonge said that no amount of legislative insulation can prevent against collapse and that it is political attitudes that need to change.

It is a really good point.  Places like New Zealand have budgeted for outcomes.  One problem, and why I think legislation is needed for the outcomes-based approach, is that if you do not put all the pieces of the machine in place, it will not work.  There is a really good example of this in community planning.  Our local councils were given duties to deliver well-being in 2014.  We have been working with the Carnegie Trust on delivering that.  One example is in Derry where a community crisis intervention service was set up in response to crisis mental health issues.  It had buy-in from a range of public agencies which are obliged under the legislation to act in partnership as well as community and voluntary service.  In the first six months it had 141 interventions, which is essentially suicide prevention, and generated &pound;23,000 in savings in that time.  However, because we do not budget for outcomes, the Assembly had a debate on this twice, calling on the Minister for Health to provide funding to cover the services.  Part of this is about health but a lot of it is about other issues, including poverty, community, and policing and justice.  It sits within so many areas.  Until we move our budgeting to reflect an outcomes-based model we will not get it right.  We cannot do this in little bits, we need to do it in totality.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned the civic forum.  The citizens' assembly model might be a better one now because it brings everyone in, it does not just take the people whose voices are probably heard in other walks of life that are advocating and representing.  It is the people on the ground who are living in communities are those who we really need to hear from.  They are the people whose confidence in the institutions is probably a lot lower and their voices are not heard.  We need a model of deliberative democracy.  That energy would be better spent in a citizens assembly model at this point.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Mercer"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>There is just half a minute left in this slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#F00600","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn and Mr. Finucane for their kind words.<\/p><p>On Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point on the experience of nationalists, if one looks at the numbers in the Assembly now there are 40 designated unionists and 39 designated nationalists.  There are no majorities.  It is an assembly of minorities, in effect, so there are no concerns about that.  An earlier questioner mentioned councils which work on weighted majority voting, and asked what would happen If we were to remove things like designation.  Designation does not impact on creating the Executive, as such, as that is done with d'Hondt.  That is why we end up with the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in the one government, which as the Deputy rightly says, would not happen on any other planet, almost.  Those two parties would not be in same government otherwise.  Unionism is much more fractured at the moment than nationalism.  There is probably more of a confidence in nationalism.

It has been a really interesting session and really encouraging as well.  We heard some surprisingly positive statistics there about people's attachment to devolution.  To paraphrase what Mr. McCallister said, nobody has come up with a better idea than an architecture to facilitate power-sharing.  I know where Senator Blaney was coming from in terms of the Good Friday Agreement having been endorsed by the people and we must be sensitive about potentially changing it.  There have been some problematic divergences, like the fact the petition of concern has never really been used in the way envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.  It has never or rarely had the <i>ad hoc<\/i>committees that were supposed to look at the reasoning.  Also, some of the more problematic changes like the privatisation of the election of First Ministers happened at St. Andrews over the heads of people.  Thus while things like reviewing designation should absolutely go back to the people for endorsement some of the changes have already happened and were done by politicians, for politicians.  Notwithstanding Professor Tonge's point that no amount or rules and regulations can counteract the will not being there it is important we see the Good Friday Agreement not as a family heirloom or some relic one just looks at but rather as a living, breathing toolkit to facilitate this stuff.<br\/><br\/>I have loads of questions and I am interested in the Chairman's suggestion we might be able to get the witnesses back.  I have a brief question for each witness.<br\/><br\/>Ms Mercer suggested well-being concepts could be legislatively embedded both as a way of getting better outcomes and going around those who set their faces against a rights-based approach.  Are those Bills working in Scotland and Wales given they have some of the same strictures on their finances as we would, in other words, the lack of the full tax toolkit?<br\/><br\/>Mr. McCallister spoke about the mandatory coalition aspect and the fact there is not really an incentive to compromise.  The parties know that so long as they get their mandate and their voters out for their position there is not really a need to appeal to anybody else.  He is right to say that the five parties in government are a fairly unnatural set of partnerings.  Will he briefly touch on some of the other mechanisms that could give protections short of mandatory coalition, and maybe if designation changed, things like qualified majority voting?  I believe he touched on the latter in his bill, though it did not pass on that day.<br\/><br\/>Turning to Professor Tonge, how would a review of this stuff optimally happen?  I was interested in, and did not know about, Ms Mercer's point about how citizens' assemblies can come from the First Ministers regularly.  Some things, like formally equalising the First Ministers, the SDLP tried to do by amending the New Decade, New Approach Bill.  In theory, if the will and legislative time were there could these changes be done in the Assembly or are they reserved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Hanna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hanna for the question and the invitation today.  She asked about well-being outcomes and how that is working in other jurisdictions.  Scotland has the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 and Wales has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.  Wales also has a future generations commissioner whose responsibility is to ensure public bodies are fulfilling their duties to long-term planning and to putting well-being at the centre of it.  Wales is probably the best example for us to look at locally.  The Carnegie Trust facilitated a study trip with a lot of councillors and community planners from Northern Ireland over to Wales to see how it was operating and it was a really useful trip for them.  As to whether they are working, both are in pretty early days at the minute.  The right signs are there.  The problem is the only place doing budgeting to outcomes is New Zealand.  We are all limited across the UK by the Chancellor moving to annual budgeting, as Mr. Finucane mentioned earlier, so we cannot plan for multiple years.  I believe it was because of Covid we moved away from that commitment but that is an an issue and we must move beyond that.<br\/><br\/>One of the things that has been really interesting has to do with New Zealand, which is the world leader in this.  I read an article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>recently by one of the public health experts on New Zealand's response to Covid.  As members probably know, New Zealand has been one of the most successful countries in the world in terms of Covid response.  The expert said New Zealand's commitment to well-being and seeing its people as its economy had underpinned the response and the value base was part of the success in that.  Due to New Zealand putting well-being at the centre of what it was trying to achieve in its response it has been able to have very low levels of death and hospitalisations.  That whole approach has been something that has characterised how its public policy is delivered.  She said if new Zealand had not had well-being at the centre she did not think it would have done the same thing.  There is a lot to learn from other places and a lot to learn locally from community planning, as I touched on earlier.  Those are really good working examples of how we could take that forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Mercer"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>I might answer Mr. Finucane's question on a bill of rights as I did not get time before.  I am unambiguous on this and can give a very short reply.  I totally support full implementation of a bill of rights in the same way I support full implementation of Irish language provisions.  It is a clear-cut answer.  On the question on political institutions and the attitudes to change, the point I was trying to make was not to put blame any particular party but to say collapse must be a last resort.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Hanna for helping to raise the invitation.  On what would happen with a citizens' assembly, there are obviously different models for setting those up.  I would try to follow the model that is there in the South for setting up and getting a truly representative body.  It is certainly entirely doable.  On the mechanisms of it, it is there in New Decade, New Approach that one would have this civic advisory panel set up under that agreement which advises the Executive.  I think I was mistaken before in saying the First Ministers choose the issue.  It is the civic advisory panel that advises the Executive on how that citizens' assembly should proceed, the nature of topics that could usefully be addressed and the decision-making forum.  What influence it would have would again be up to the Executive and whether it would then make legislative recommendations and draft a Bill on the basis of what a citizens' assembly proposes.<\/p> <p>  The citizens' assembly model is better than a civic forum model.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn's question about what happened to the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland is a good one.  It disappeared without trace.  I would like to see it back but it is more important to have a citizens' assembly.  The civic forum was contentious because some people objected to who should be in it.  There was never consensus about who should be in it.  For example, the Orange Order asked why it was not in it as it represents thousands of people in Northern Ireland.  Thus you will not get consensus, whereas with a citizens' assembly, because it is randomly selected, albeit weighted to be representative of the population, no one can seriously object to who takes part in it.  It would not be a credible position to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Jonathan Tonge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hanna both for arranging this and for her question.  There are a few things.  Around the removal of designation, we can easily move to weighted majority voting, like our councils do.<\/p><p>This is even though some of our councils are quite heavily skewed towards one community or another, such as Derry City and Strabane District Council versus the area of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council I live in, which is quite heavily unionist.  As was stated earlier, they still function.  One could move to that designation but it is something that belongs to the late 1990s and early 2000s more so than today.  <\/p><p> I would certainly move a petition of concern.  If there is a move away from designation, at least three parties should have to sign a petition of concern so broad support is built up in order to really challenge something.  I recall someone, who is now First Minister, wanted to bring in a Bill on some issue and Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Green Party and the Alliance Party were all willing to sign a petition of concern to stop it.  That type of broad coalition is needed.<\/p><p> There are other issues we need to look at.  We are nowhere near talking about the D'hondt formula, which is the mathematical calculation that populates the Executive.  It goes back to Deputy Mac Lochlainn's point that in no other place would there be parties as diverse as that.  One could look at other mechanisms and the D'hondt formula as a default if a Government cannot be formed, considering how long it took to negotiate and form a Government in the Republic.  <\/p><p> It should also be asked if one party, of any persuasion, should be allowed to collapse the Assembly.  The lesson learned from the 2017 collapse was that it is easy to collapse the Assembly but be warned about how long it takes to get it back.  The reasons for the collapse included the renewable heat incentive, RHI, scheme, the Irish language issue and, more recently, the problems when the DUP changed leader, wanted to nominate a First Minister and the problems around that.  Mechanisms to have a vote in the Assembly whereby not only First Ministers but the entire Executive are approved could be looked at.  The issue of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister is key.  I pushed for it in my Bill but did not get support, even from people I thought would have been more supportive of it.  We could well hit next year when suddenly this becomes an issue and we are trying to solve something that need not, and should not, be a problem, that is, to do that.  <\/p><p> Those areas are on whether one party should have the monopoly on collapsing the Executive.  If one party wants to sit out of the Executive there is space now for opposition, but should it have that monopoly of nobody else being allowed to go in?  There is a challenge to all parties in this.  For example, would members of the Ulster Unionist Party want to go into an Executive if the Democratic Unionist Party was not in it, or would the SDLP want to go into an Executive if Sinn F&eacute;in was not there?  There is almost this fig leaf or cover of respectability in having the other party in there.  We might not like or agree with a party but it gives an element of political cover for worries about who will move or do what at the next election and jog in for position.  All of those issues play a part in how we build up.  If we can get over the hurdle of another election, get into a period of more stable Government and get the Assembly working, we can start to do this and, as was stated at the very start, not deal with this in a time of crisis but in a time of stability.<\/p><p> Professor Tonge mentioned the Irish language issue.  The time to have dealt with that would have been after the 2016 election, when unionism was in a very strong, confident position and was being generous about doing something about the Irish language.  If I had been re-elected then, I wanted to do something on the Irish language and on the armed forces covenant.  I would have got something done as long as I could have avoided the petition of concern.  That would have been an interesting way to do it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCallister","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>This has been a very interesting discussion.  I will reflect on the sobering reality that while the Good Friday Agreement is a remarkable document, in the current context we have to be realistic that it is very difficult to see, with the current state of relations between the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland, how an agreement could be negotiated on first principles today.  This really puts into context how fragile our politics are but given Northern Ireland is a society of contradictions, at the same time, we have a very fast moving, evolving society, especially in its attitudes and how people are framing their identity.  It is important that the agreement is capable of evolving and keeping up with developments in that regard.<br\/><br\/>My first question is probably one for Professor Tonge, as the academic, to pick up but it may also be for Ms Mercer and Mr. McAllister, if they have anything to say on it.  I look elsewhere in the world, particularly to other deeply divided societies, to see how and where peace agreements can evolve either by agreement or force of circumstance.  I am conscious that there are more examples of situations that have become more ossified.  I am thinking of somewhere like Lebanon where I believe there has not been a census since the 1940s because people there are scared of the implications of the results in undermining the very rigorous consociational model seen in somewhere like Bosnia.  In Bosnia in the mid-1990s, around the same time as the Good Friday Agreement, a three-stranded Bosnian-Serb-Croat sharing of power was locked in, which is still with us today and is, perhaps, stopping Bosnia from evolving.<br\/><br\/>How can we persuade those parties with a vested interest in the current system, particularly, of the need for reform?  I am struck by the fact that the Governments, primarily the UK Government, will not move with more radical change unless the parties, collectively, ask for it, especially the two largest parties that benefit from the vetoes in the Executive and the designation.  Those parties do not see it as in their interests to reform.  How can we manage this process of evolution of our structures outside of a crisis having to force action in that regard?  How can we persuade those who have an interest in the <i>status quo<\/i>of the need for change?<br\/><br\/>I will highlight what can often be the law of unintended consequences.  I am particularly conscious of the petition of concern issue, which was put into the agreement for very good reasons given the history of Northern Ireland over the previous 70 years but has acted, not to protect minorities as such, but to ossify power structures.  If we have neutral vetoes, it tends to serve the interests of those who are happiest with the <i>status quo<\/i>and has hampered those who want to see change.  In that regard, I am particularly struck - and I stand to be corrected - that I cannot think of any significant time when the Assembly passed any significant human rights or equality legislation.  It has always had to fall back on the Westminster Government, either during direct rule or through other types of intervention, to address those issues.  How can we break the cycle of the Assembly being incapable of addressing those issues that cut to the heart of identity, human rights and equality issues?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephen Farry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>I promise the Chair I will be brief.  Mr. Farry is correct that there has not been a census in Lebanon since 1932, given the sensitivities of it.<\/p><p>Consociational deals like the Good Friday Agreement are inherently unstable because they are about trying to resolve acute constitutional differences within a framework which at least parks those constitutional questions.  That is inevitable.  The Bosnia case mentioned by Dr. Farry has created three different presidencies, a whole mass of legislatures and approximately ten different cantons.  That is the nature of it.  Without getting bogged down in it, you have Bosnian Serbs who resist further moves to integrate into a Bosnian identity with which they do not associate and that is the problem.  There is a limit to which you can push identities if they are not dearly held.  The Good Friday Agreement is a step up on the Lebanese and Bosnian cases because it offers far greater respect for differences in identity.  That is why I am more positive about the Good Friday Agreement than those two cases which I teach and are regularly fairly disastrous politically.  That is the only point I want to make.  There is no alternative to a consociational deal for Northern Ireland pending a longer-term resolution of the constitutional position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Jonathan Tonge","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>It is good to see Dr. Farry.

With regard to the petitions of concern, I accept Professor Tonge's earlier point that with numbers below 30, it is harder to trigger, but I would like to see a broader number of people being able to sign it, at least from two or three different parties or independents, whereby you have to build in and argue for support and it not just being triggered because you are greatly opposed to equal marriage.  Even over contentious things such as abortion, had the Assembly acted on abortion when I was coming to the end of my time there - amendments were coming from Trevor Lunn and others - there would have been no need for Westminster or no pressure for it to do so.  However, Dr. Farry is right on human rights issues and we are fortunate to have things such as the human rights commission, the equality commission, section 75 and things like that to do that.  I do not know whether there would be confidence that the Assembly would necessarily address those issues.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to things such as a bill of rights, we have probably seen movement, albeit minor, on that over the past 18 months from the New Decade, New Approach.  I agree with Dr. Farry's points around that.  Were Alliance to do well in next year's elections, it would raise the question of how do you handle this large group of others with no designation.  What would happen in respect of the posts of First Minister and deputy First Minister, or the First Ministers?  I refer to all those issues.

What we need to do is to create a situation whereby we are not trying to get one over on the DUP or one over on Sinn F&eacute;in or any of that sort of thing.  We are trying to make the institutions work and no politician should be afraid of that.  The <i>status quo<\/i>does not suit anyone at present.  I do not know whether anyone will be terribly concerned about keeping things as they are, because everyone has their issue with it.  There is an opportunity, in that Brexit, Covid-19 and the climate at present in terms of the need to build back better means we may be at a point in the road at which it would be appropriate to have a wider public conversation and, critically, to take it outside Stormont.  I know it is hard.  We need to get Stormont's buy-in to take it outside of Stormont but if you look at the text in the New Decade, New Approach, NDNA, and the tone, it is all about public engagement.  It is all about accountability.  It is really making people do what they say they will do and holding them to account.<br\/><br\/>The other thing is in terms of switching the focus from everything is about the constitution.  People are rightly entitled to hold their beliefs, whether they are nationalist, unionist or they do not care.  We are not taking away from that.  I am harping on about well-being but going back to changing the focus of why decisions and policy are made is really important.  When that outcomes-based approach came out in 2016, there was so much excitement.  We had Martin McGuinness and Arlene Foster standing side by side, really excited about this concept.  Wider civic society was really excited about it as well and there was an opportunity there for us to be, not quite world leaders, but up in the top five of being able to deliver on this.<br\/><br\/>With regard to creating a bit of ambition about what we can do within the current state we live, we need to somehow take the heat off the constitution.  The provision is there within the Northern Ireland Act for a border poll.  That is there and that is not going anywhere but we need to be a bit more at ease with ourselves in terms of what we can achieve when we are living in this moment, because we are missing the opportunity to deliver better outcomes for people by always transferring the focus to whether you want live in a united Ireland or in the UK.  We need to look at other ways of having that conversation, reframing the debate and changing the focus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Mercer"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>I thank all our witnesses this morning for an amazing and informative discussion and I am intrigued by it all.

It should not have been allowed to disappear.  As I said earlier, citizens' assemblies ultimately are better ways of resolving issues than a permanent civic forum but there is a place for both.

It is important that we frame it in the right way.<\/p> <p>  Also, it is of critical importance to look at what issues we talk about.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned earlier about whether it should be strand 1 or strand 2, or all three.  We need to start with strand 1.  We need to have the conversation with people within Northern Ireland first to get buy-in because once you start bringing in strands 2 and 3, you start losing support from unionism.  We owe it to ourselves to have that conversation within Northern Ireland initially and then broaden out, because you need to take people with you.  If you want to find your agreed Ireland, we need to start having those conversations with our neighbours first.

I see the inherent difficulties of necessarily getting unionists to engage if you have a citizens' assembly on the constitution but it is not impossible.

There is not a uniform position within unionism.<\/p> <p>  It might not be the starting point.  I would not necessarily recommend the first citizens' assembly to be on the constitution, but there is an argument for a citizens' assembly on the constitution, not least to work out the structures.  Unionists would still be unionists.  They would still vote for the union in a border poll but you could have a legitimate debate within a citizens' assembly as to the structures to try to form what a united Ireland would look like if there was a vote in favour of a border poll.  For example, what would be the role of Stormont?  How much power would be devolved to the North in the event of Irish unity?  That would be one area to consider.<\/p> <p>  As a starting point, I would echo Ms Mercer's point.  One should build up gently.  The first citizens' assembly topic might have to be something rather more routine, whether it be integrated education provision or something like that.

It is nice to see Professor Tonge again.  It has been a while.  Before the pandemic, Professor Tonge was here in Leinster House and I thought what he had to say then was extremely interesting.  I thank Mr. McCallister and Ms Mercer as well.<\/p> <p>  I get what Mr. McCallister says in terms of attitudinal changes being more important than institutional reforms.  I suppose what would concern me is that the focus here is particularly on institutional reforms and the fact that we have an international legally-binding agreement that we all bought into on that basis.  I suppose what concerns us as a committee is the implementation deficit.  Are we only to keep moving on and on without implementing what was painstakingly agreed, whether it be in New Decade, New Approach or the Good Friday Agreement?  Are we running away from this?  Mr. McCallister says that we should lead in gently but I had to smile at that.  After 23 years, maybe it is time for us to grasp what we need to do.  My sons were not born 23 years ago.  We are moving on to another generation.  All of us here on the call have a real responsibility to make sure that it does not continue on for generations.  We have to try to stop it at this generation.<\/p> <p>  My questions, I suppose, are for everyone, but maybe Professor Tonge and Mr. McCallister in particular.  What are the main blocks, as they would see it, to implementing the outstanding elements, particularly in terms of the bill of rights?  We can talk forever and a day about outcomes for citizens, but the measure on all of us, whether we are here in the Oireachtas, in the Assembly or in the Executive, is what difference there is for people on the ground.  After all of those agreements, are we in a situation where the mother or young person in Shankill Road, Falls Road or wherever has a greater opportunity?  Are we opening up things for them or are we closing them down, and are we almost using them to build up an industry around talking about it without getting in there and doing what needs to be done?  For me, even going through New Decade, New Approach, all of the answers to all of the things that we spoke about in terms of the societal well-being are there.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel around it.  I very much appreciate I am coming from Mayo.  I am coming from an outside view of this and I stand to be corrected on most or all of it.<\/p> <p>  The thing with the citizens' assembly is there is real hope for us there.  If it was to be done right in terms of the terms of reference and the make-up, in particular, in having an inclusion of voices there, the architecture and structures that we talk about here could be examined and discussed within the context of other issues like rights-based health, education - in which I have a special interest - etc. regardless of the constitutional preference.<\/p><p>We can also have over-consultation and over-engagement with civic society as well.  In 2019 we had 1,000 citizens from across the country and right across the island writing to the Taoiseach and to the people who are responsible for implementing these agreements saying what they basically wanted in a citizens&rsquo; assembly.  The Taoiseach at the time agreed that he would certainly not rule that out and engaged with the idea of it.  I want to know what our witnesses think where we cannot just keep pushing the can down the road.  The Taoiseach at that time said that this should not be a threat to anybody&rsquo;s constitutional preference and he even said that the Good Friday Agreement explicitly recognises and validates the legitimacy of both constitutional positions.  <\/p><p> I would even say to Mr. McCallister that it is very difficult to hear what the merits of the union are, other than identity and we want to hear what these are.  As republicans, nationalists and everyone across the island, would a citizens&rsquo; assembly not be an opportunity to say that this is why we really believe that the Six Counties should be a part of the union rather than Irish unity and we could have the discussions there.  <\/p><p> I am sorry that I have gone on for so long because I want to get back to the issues of the bill of rights, the Assembly and the political attitudes and to ask whichever one of our guests would like to deal with these questions first.

Civic unionism is way ahead of political unionism and there are many people who want to be involved in creating a better society for all of us on the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Brexit was a game-changer.  Farmers in the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone are deeply frustrated about the challenges they face as a result of Brexit and they want to be involved in that discussion.

Looking at the citizens&rsquo; assembly, I probably would not start off with a discussion of Irish unity or the merits of staying in the union like Professor Tonge.  There is a very significant swathe of issues that we need to look at and address.  We need to make Northern Ireland work, no matter whether one wants to stay in the union as I do, or leave the union as Ms Gildernew would like us to.  The Assembly does not debate very often the merits of staying within the union or of a united Ireland.  The vast majority of the Assembly&rsquo;s time as a legislative institution has been spent putting through legislation and it is one thing that it has been actually quite good at.  Professor Tonge mentioned the figures of how much legislation it covered in the 2007 to 2016 period.  <\/p> <p>  Even when I was sitting on the health committee with Ms Gildernew we would have been talking about issues such as services in South Tyrone Hospital, Daisy Hill Hospital or Craigavon Hospital that affected all of our constituents.  In respect of under-achievement in education, I always knew that there would be much support from members of Sinn F&eacute;in in tackling under-achievement in places like the Shankill Road and the Falls Road and in Protestant working class areas.  There was a real hunger to actually address those issues way up-stream with early intervention.  We have talked a great deal about this in the Assembly but have never really started to deliver on it.  There will be a plethora of issues that any citizens&rsquo; assembly could really start to unpick and help that policy development that Ms Mercer has talked about right through this morning&rsquo;s presentation.  All of those things are worth doing.<\/p> <p>  Where does Deputy Conway-Walsh want me to begin on the merits of the union?  It is a very good product and well worth selling.  From being part of one of the world&rsquo;s largest economies, and need I say more than the National Health Service, which did a fantastic job in looking after the level of the vaccine roll-out in Northern Ireland and across the UK, which has been phenomenally successful.  That is one of the big advantages of having a dedicated public health system.  I will not overdo it too much but it is all of those things.<\/p> <p>  On issues like a bill of rights, it is probably getting at the times when there is the political will to do this.  Sometimes, when the pressure is on we can get agreement but then we can quickly move away.  Without naming parties or anybody there was probably enough guilt on all sides of things with this not being totally backed by all or where people moved slightly away from different positions when we got going.  It is almost like keeping the train on the track and hoping that none of these things come and derail it.  <\/p> <p>   There is a great appetite over some of those policy matters and the bread-and-butter issues.  On some of those issues, there is a much greater unity of purpose between the parties than sometimes the opening labels, the party websites or the party mantra might suggest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCallister"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1114,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCallister very much.

Senator Blaney is entirely right about being practical about this.  I think Deputy Conway-Walsh and Ms Gildernew alluded to the fact that 23 years later things have not been delivered, so there is a real need to start bringing things forward.<\/p> <p>  As for institutional reform, the model is there.  We have a commitment to a citizens' assembly in New Decade, New Approach.  It is a matter of holding people to account and delivering that.  There are citizens' assembly models across the UK now, as well as in Ireland.  There has been one on Scotland's future and one on climate recovery across the UK, so the model is there and it is a matter of holding our politicians to account in delivering this.<\/p> <p>  As for embedding the policy, we have an outcomes-based programme for government.  It is just about getting the legislation to support well-being within that.  There are people lobbying for that at the minute.  These things are doable and practical.  As responsible organisations, we need not to stand on the fringes criticising what politicians are doing but to give them practical tools and to tell them, \"If you do this, it may help make your job easier.\"  Change is nothing to fear.  That might not be a statement that has characterised the past 23 years, but we need to make the case for these changes in helping the political process.  No one should fear being more effective at governance.  It is not just about supporting politicians; it is about layering not just the politics but also governance for them to do the best job they can.  If we have not created the optimal conditions for people to deliver legislation, to deliver on policy and to deliver on outcomes for people's lives, we cannot be surprised when things fall apart every few years.  There are practical things we can do in that regard; I have alluded to them in my presentation.  It is about having those conversations and taking them forward.  None of the things I have suggested have been completely pooh-poohed by any party, so it is about having the will to take them forward.  The role of this committee is really important in doing that because it is charged with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, so perhaps the members are the people to start putting these recommendations to the Assembly and delivering a paper in that way, while getting the British and Irish Governments involved as well.  There is a bit of a perception that they come in at a crisis point and then leave the stage.  How do you get the British and Irish Governments to come in when things are not too bad and to facilitate conversations, using the mechanisms that are already there, to discuss how Northern Ireland can optimise its operations in a political sense?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2021071300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Mercer"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>That was a very important contribution.

Professor Tonge had some very interesting data on people's attachment to the institutions and the concepts of power-sharing.  Is there anything out there that disaggregates people's attachment to power-sharing and to the precise set of regulations we have at the moment?  Could Mr. McCallister and Professor Tonge build generally on Ms Mercer's point about how this could be brought forward?  I appreciate that this is kind of an entry-level conversation, not least because the agreement has been our lifeboat or our amulet against a very hard Brexit and there are those who would be only too willing to throw the baby out with the bathwater in examining it.  As we have established through the likes of the St. Andrews Agreement and, for example, Mr. McCallister's Bill in 2015, which created an official opposition, we have tweaked this in the way the Good Friday Agreement was designed to accommodate these matters.  Perhaps all the witnesses could build on how we should best advance this conversation.  I agree with Ms Mercer that this committee is charged with overseeing the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  There are so many external impediments, frustrations and challenges, Brexit being the key one and Anglo-Irish relationships being a broader one, but there are efficiencies and improvements here that could be in the hands of the Assembly and that are entirely within its gift.  It would be a good function of this committee to help facilitate that conversation and, as Senator Currie suggested, maybe advance a paper on it.

We commend the committee for giving visibility to the key issues affecting Travellers during this challenging time.  Given the limited time that we have and the complexities of the issues that we wish to highlight, we are going to focus explicitly on key issues and strategic recommendations as related to Travellers.<\/p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge from the beginning that while Covid-19 has had a huge impact on people globally, it has disproportionately impacted on marginalised and minority communities, including Travellers and Roma.  We know that Travellers and Roma who get Covid-19 are more likely to end up in hospital, go into intensive care units, ICU, and die from the virus than the general population.  This should not come as a surprise to anyone given Travellers well documented poor health, severe overcrowding and lack of access to the most basic facilities on Traveller sites.  All of us were told how important it was to keep our distance and wash our hands to stop the spread of the virus.  How can we expect Travellers to do this when we are living on top of each other and many of us do not even have access to running water?  We know that the past year has been difficult for everyone's mental health and we rightly hear about this in the media, but for my community, the Traveller community, this pandemic came at a time when our mental health was already at a crisis point.  The shocking data on Traveller mental health is well known.  As a community we are a high risk group for suicide and poor mental health, including frequent mental distress.  We know that Travellers experience a six times higher suicide rate, which accounts for about 11% of all Traveller deaths.  This means that one in every ten Travellers will die by suicide.  This is unacceptable for any community, let alone my community.<\/p> <p>  As mental health workers in Pavee Point, we have seen how Covid-19 has impacted our community and the stress that it has caused.  Could members imagine the stress of living on a site without any water, toilet or basic facilities, worrying about trying to socially distance oneself and not spread the virus to one's family, or spreading it to one's older grandparents or older Travellers who are already vulnerable to the virus?  Added to that, we must try to make sure that our children keep up with their education while often not having formal education ourselves, lacking computer literacy and digital skills.  Most sites do not have Internet and it is hard to get space for children to do their work and concentrate in a crowded trailer or house.<\/p> <p>  The lockdowns were very hard for us.  Most sites or group housing schemes no longer have green spaces, play areas or places for us to mix.  We are increasingly forced to live in large ghettos on the outskirts of towns or near motorways.  Where can our children safely play or go for a walk when there is no public lighting and no safe paths to walk?  This all adds to our mental stress.<\/p> <p>  During the pandemic we have seen a lot of hate speech and anti-Traveller racism published on social media platforms.  Imagine how this makes us feel.  We are made to feel not welcome in Ireland, that we are second class citizens and that the country would be better off without us.  This affects our health, especially our mental health.  We have seen that in order to deal with this stress some Travellers, similar to the general population, have turned to drink and drugs, which has made the situation worse.  We have witnessed the alarming numbers of Travellers self-harming and, unfortunately, Traveller suicides during this time.  We personally know of two Traveller suicides in the past week alone.<\/p> <p>  We also know that similar to the general population, many Travellers did not have access to mental health services during this time.  Instead, telemental health services were deployed to bridge the gap.  We understand that this approach will be the one the services take in the future, but this approach is not suitable for the majority of Travellers given the well documented low levels of literacy which is needed to navigate technology, the lack of access to suitable technology and the lack of privacy when living in overcrowded accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Traveller organisations and Traveller primary healthcare projects have mobilised across the country to protect Travellers' health, including mental health.  We have seen goodwill, support and collaboration from colleagues in the HSE and from Departments in working with us to ensure Traveller health concerns related to Covid-19 are addressed in an accessible and culturally appropriate manner.<\/p><p>That has been especially important at this challenging time when Travellers have been scared of the impact of the virus on our families and the wider community.  We are hopeful that this will become a legacy of Covid-19 as we move into the future.  However, what the pandemic has taught us is that we need Government leadership and a long-term plan.  Such a plan must be focused, strategic and well resourced if we are serious about having better outcomes and protecting the health of Travellers.  I hand over now to my colleague, Mr. Reilly, to present our recommendations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1139,"content":"<p>First, we recommend the urgent publication and implementation of the national traveller health action plan without further delay.  We understand this plan is being reviewed by the Department of Health.  Travellers and Traveller organisations participated in consultations in 2018 and three years later, we are still waiting for this plan.  We welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to implement the national traveller health action plan, but there have been major delays.  We are concerned that our health is getting worse because of a blockage somewhere in the Department of Health and this plan not being prioritised.  Is this fair?  We need a health action plan and we need it now.  Travellers cannot wait any longer.  We are losing our people and we cannot wait any longer.<\/p> <p>  Second, we recommend that resources allocated to Traveller mental health must be spent on Traveller mental health work.  In 2018, we presented to the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care.  It recommended that more resources and funding be targeted at the areas of highest need, with particular attention being paid to Travellers and to addressing suicide.  It would be good if this committee could see what has happened to this recommendation.  With the exception of the appointment of nine HSE mental health service co-ordinators for Travellers and dormant accounts funding, we understand that there is no dedicated budget for Traveller mental health.  Since the co-ordinator posts were funded in 2015 and recruitment for the roles was undertaken in 2017 and 2018, one such community healthcare organisation, CHO, post has never been filled, at an approximate loss of &euro;300,000, in addition to the loss of resources and support for Traveller mental health.  This is unacceptable, given the current Traveller mental health crisis, higher rates of suicide and poor mental health among Travellers.  While we acknowledge dormant accounts funding from the Department of Health, it is imperative that this is mainstreamed and that ongoing Traveller mental health work receive sustainable and ring-fenced funding to respond to Traveller mental health inequalities, especially in the post-Covid-19 context.  I hope we will get to that stage.  Pavee Point, alongside other Traveller organisations, is ready, willing and able to undertake this work in partnership with the HSE and Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  Third, we recommend that Traveller mental health is prioritised within the Department of Health and the HSE.  Traveller health structures at national and regional levels often lack high-level engagement from the Department of Health or the HSE and, as result, Traveller mental health remains marginalised.  We recommend that there be representation of HSE mental health heads of service on national and regional Traveller health structures, given the documented mental health crisis our community is living with.  Traveller representation on mental health structures at national and local levels must also be prioritised.  We have seen evidence of this in our own area where we have engaged with the local structures and have witnessed the difference that such collaboration can make.  Following our presentation to the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care in 2018, the development of a Traveller and Roma mental health action plan was recommended and we welcome the commitment in this regard in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, we recommend the implementation of ethnic equality monitoring across all health data collection systems, including mental health.  Without this, we are basically invisible in mental health policy and service provision because we are not being counted.  Information on ethnicity is not being collected, despite this being Government policy.  We recommend the implementation of ethnic equality monitoring, including a standardised ethnic identifier consistent with the national census and inclusive of Roma, across all routine data administrative systems in mental health services, and including the National Self-Harm Registry Ireland.  The World Health Organization, WHO, supports our position on this aspect.  As Dr. Mike Ryan said last week, \"What gets measured gets done\".  If we do not measure things according to groups, then we are never going to have the data to identify the extent of the problem and make sharp improvements.  This is straightforward: without those data, we will continue to be invisible and we will be having this conversation year in and year out.  <\/p> <p>  We thank the Chair and the members of the committee again for their time this afternoon and we welcome comments and questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reilly and Ms McDonnell for their informative and concise presentations.

I apologise for the time change but other matters were going on.  Unfortunately, though, that time change has torpedoed all our schedules.  I have great admiration for the work Pavee Point does.  It can sometimes feel like two steps forward are being made, only to end up then taking five steps backward.  I state that because housing obviously is a major problem.  Proper and appropriate accommodation for members of the Traveller community is an enormous problem.  It is a situation that clearly leads to mental health challenges and especially during the pandemic we have experienced in the last 18 months.<\/p> <p>  My next point may be somewhat off topic but it is relevant.  Turning to the local authorities and their role in this matter, could the witnesses give me an example of best practice that they are aware of in this regard?  I refer to a local authority and its engagement in respect of Traveller accommodation.  I also ask them to give an example of worst practice by a local authority.  I ask that because I always find it astonishing that central government allocates millions of euro to local authorities to upgrade and provide accommodation for the Traveller community, while year after year only a small proportion of that money is ever drawn down and spent.  The Government, therefore, can make policy and allocate funding provision in the budget for Traveller accommodation but the local authorities are just not spending those funds.  I would like the witnesses' views on those aspects.  If they may not be in a position to answer now, perhaps someone in Pavee Point might respond on that point.<\/p> <p>  My other question concerns the oversight function referred to in the fourth recommendation.  Can the witnesses point to somewhere in Europe that we could learn from and emulate best practice in respect of such oversight?  Those are two of the thoughts that occurred to me during the comprehensive presentations of our guests.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#B00500","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1142,"content":"<p>With permission from the Chair, I will answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>Yes, that is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#B00700","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for his questions and comments.  He rightly alluded to accommodation having a huge impact on people's health.  It has presented a particular challenge in respect of mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I would be slow to recognise a particular local authority for its good practice, because there has been little good practice in this regard that could be emulated.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has conducted an equality audit of all Traveller accommodation programmes and made specific recommendations to each local authority regarding required improvements in their work concerning the provision of accommodation.  Those findings are being launched tomorrow.  We have not had sight of them yet, but I will refer the Senator to that information when it is available.  Recommendations will be made regarding each local authority and it will be important that all Oireachtas committees monitor their implementation.<\/p><p>As Senator Conway rightly says, many local authorities do not draw down the funding.  Between 2000 and 2017, the expenditure for Traveller accommodation fell from &euro;135 million to &euro;20 million and since the establishment of the Traveller accommodation programmes in 2000, a total of &euro;69 million has never been drawn down.  There are complex reasons this happened but poor, overcrowded living conditions leads to poor health.  According to the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, there are 134 excess Traveller deaths per year.  When Travellers are dying from respiratory and heart complaints and cancer, you have to ask yourself why are they dying in greater numbers at all levels for all illnesses.  For us, that is linked to institutional racism.  Cancer does not affect a Traveller's body in a particular way.  It is because people are either not getting access to services, not getting timely access to services or not receiving quality services.<\/p><p> In terms of the oversight issue the Senator asked about looking at Europe.  I would have to be very proud of being Irish and very proud of our NGO sector and the collaboration we have with the State in Ireland.  We can be very proud of that.  The big fault we have in Ireland is we do not implement policy that we have developed.  We have much better consultative forums, we have much greater participation of NGOs but where we fail abysmally is in implementing agreed Government policy.  If you look at the Traveller accommodation plans, there never seems to be any sanctions.  We warmly welcome the recent report of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in terms of a particular site and the impact it has on children.  What we need to focus on into the future - that is why we would highlight the need for the ethnic data - is outcomes, how is policy implementation and identifying the blocks, that is, why the policy is not getting implemented and why we are not achieving good outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>How do the witnesses find the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACCs, in each of the local authorities?

I would consider these committees a useful forum.  There are some counties where there is very little Traveller participation in them which is a pity but, overall, the structure works well.

We can send the committee more detailed information after this presentation.<\/p> <p>  The LTACCs are not an effective tool, and it is related to my earlier point in terms of implementation.  Often they result in being a talking shop.  The conversations happen but the action does not happen and the improvements do not happen.<\/p> <p>  What we saw during Covid, which is interesting and is something we would strongly recommend, is that public health needs to engage in Traveller accommodation issues.  With the involvement of public health departments and doctors, we saw during Covid that we could get water, toilets, electricity, hardstand and rubbish collection delivered in a short space of time because public health and the Public Health Act superseded the local authority.  We need to look at it as a potential enabler in terms of future delivery of Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We will send in more detail.  There are concerns about some of the LTACCs.  In some cases, local councillors deliberately go on them to make sure there is no site provided in their part of the constituency.  There are some local authority officials who leave much to be desired in terms of their public sector duty to promote equality, combat discrimination and protect human rights.<\/p> <p>  As I say, in some areas - the Senator himself alluded to it - there is not effective Traveller participation but I would say that is the least of our problems.  Some of the reasons people choose not to participate is they feel it is a complete and utter waste of time - you go there, you raise the issues and very little happens.<\/p> <p>  Something Pavee Point has been calling for for many years is a Traveller agency which will look at the oversight of all Traveller policy because accommodation is a key issue but so are health, education, employment and culture.  We will not get ten agencies but if you look at what happened in Northern Ireland at a time of huge discrimination against Catholics, the power was taken out of the hands of local unionist-dominated councils and put into the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to try and ameliorate some of that.  If you look at it in terms of the Republic, there is the National Roads Authority.  There are examples where national institutional mechanisms have been put in place to try and address some of these issues.  We would say the current structure is not working in terms of policy implementation for Travellers and we need to improve it.

It was a sobering commentary on Traveller mental health in the past 18 months.  A situation that was dire prior to the pandemic has been exacerbated because of this terrible virus.<\/p> <p>  I will maybe ask Ms McDonnell a question.  Dr. Mick Ryan from the World Health Organization, WHO, addressed a Galway Traveller movement event last week.  Dr. Ryan stated, in general terms, that Ireland and other countries are underestimating a \"tsunami of mental health issues\" that are emerging as the pandemic continues.  In terms of the Traveller community, how was this exacerbated?  Ms McDonnell alluded to it already in her statement, but in what Ms McDonnell, friends and her family have seen, how was this exacerbated in the past 17 months?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#C00600","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>I am sure my colleagues can jump in and join in on this as well.  For me, on the ground, living as a Traveller woman and working during the pandemic, there are many issues, as we all know, that Travellers face in relation to their mental health.  You are living in severe overcrowded accommodation, trying to work, trying to find space for your children to sit quietly doing their home work and to keep up with their studies, and trying to encourage them to see past the deadlines and into the future of where they need the education and that they need to put in the work.  It is almost impossible when you are living in these situations where you are fearful of the virus for yourself and you are fearful for your children.  Personally, I have lots of family who are living in one yard.  There could be three mobile homes - all separate families living very closely together.  It all has a great impact on your mental health.<\/p> <p>  From personal experience, we would know many Travellers who, if they were accessing mental health services, would look for somewhere out of their local area that they would not be seen by other people to be attending these services but that is not supported by the mental health services.  In some of these services, we would push for the ethnic identifier but it would not be a question that would be asked.  During the pandemic, I was pregnant.  I was having my first baby.  There is a maternity hospital that I was attending that was supposed to be asking all of these ethnic questions.  They had the training already delivered and the ethnic identifier question was a question that should have been asked.  Only for I had the education that I knew this question had to be asked, I had to alert the hospital that I was an Irish Traveller where this question was not asked of me.  On my level of care after I had the baby, I had to alert the hospital to the fact that my baby was an Irish Traveller and that it would need a specific different type of care.<\/p><p>That had a great impact on my mental health during the pandemic.  I was trying to work, I had my first baby, and I was dealing with everyone else.  I was worried, not being able to visit friends and family.  I was fearful that I was going to pass the virus on.  My family's overall health is already poor.  I was fearful that I would potentially cause more harm than good to my family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>I would like to come in on the question that Deputy Gino Kenny asked.  I would like could come back to the first point he made, which was that this was already a crisis stage for Travellers.  He referenced Dr. Mike Ryan talking about a tsunami of mental health problems coming the line.  We could see this once the virus entered Ireland last year.  Mental health was already at a crisis stage.  Suicide and funerals were so common, we did not wonder about them anymore.  It was that common.<\/p> <p>  Ms Fay spoke specifically about what happened to Travellers in the lockdown.  Basic human needs, such as running water and access to safe and adequate electricity, were provided through the work of the Travellers' organisations.  As Ms McDonnell said, Traveller parents had to homeschool, shop, and cook for their children.  Travellers have had bad experiences in schools themselves.  There is a low level of literacy.  That was added stress for Travellers.  They had to worry about parents and loved ones.  The lockdowns of 5 km and 10 km meant they could not visit or check in on family.  I live on a site with my older grandmother.  She depends on family members to get her medication, as well as to read the instructions for her medication, so that she knows to take it at the proper time.  <\/p> <p>  Although there was isolation, we were already in a lockdown before lockdown ever happened.  There is racism and discrimination online, as seen by anyone who watched Sky Sports recently, especially after the match where England players experienced racism and discrimination because of their skin colour.   Travellers experience racism because of their ethnicity.  We have seen that on social media.  Our young population was exposed to that.  The community development approach that Travellers took within the organisations was crucial.  Health care workers on the ground need to have the trust of Travellers.  I see Senator Eileen Flynn nodding.  It was important to get proper, right, accessible information.  There was so much misinformation flying around that the virus was not real and the vaccines are going to do this and that.  That was scaremongering.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to have a relationship with Traveller organisations.  I know I said it in the recommendation.  They should be nothing for Travellers, without Travellers.  We are here as members of Traveller organisations.  We know Travellers best.  Who knows Travellers better than ourselves?  Ms McDonnell spoke about being a Traveller mother.  I am a Traveller man.  What works from one community might not work for another.  People can take what I am going to say in any way that they want, but as a Traveller man I am fed up with having the same conversation over and over.  We are losing young Traveller men and women.  We are here, but it is as if our voice is not heard.  I know Deputy Gino Kenny was there in 2018.  There were good presentations, submissions and actions yet, here we are further along, still having the same conversations.  It is hurtful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Reilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Reilly.  We have had this conversation in regard to Traveller issues three or four years ago at the committee.  It seems like a broken record.  It is shocking to hear statistic relating to the numbers of suicides in the Traveller community.  It is beyond words, sometimes, how this can be happening.  The State and the authorities are essentially allowing it to happen.  It should not happen and it has to be addressed in a fundamental way, so that we do not have this conversation again in another three years.  If the fundamental issues are not addressed then we will be having this conversation in three years.  In that time, hundreds of men and women from a Traveller background will be dead.  This is the sombre narrative we have to address collectively.  Fair play to Mr. Reilly for that honest testimony.<\/p> <p>  I have one last question for Ms Kavanagh.  It is on the report by the Ombudsman for Children on housing and living conditions in the Traveller community.

The population of the Traveller community is young.  More than half of Travellers are under the age of 25.  They live in overcrowded accommodations and they not have access, as Ms McDonnell said, to basic play sites or footpaths.  On top of that, they had to live with lockdown after lockdown during Covid-19.  It has had a huge impact on mental health.  We, therefore, welcome the report of the Ombudsman for Children.  Although it was shocking, we were not as shocked to read it as others.  We have been hearing for years about the dire situations on sites.  Although it was shocking, we welcome that this has been documented.  We are now hoping for clear action.  There were clear recommendations set out by the ombudsman.  We hope that clear action happens and that the recommendations are implemented.  As Ms Fay said earlier, we are great at developing policies.  We have great consultative mechanisms but we tend to fail on implementation across the board.

I would be hard pressed to find a group with whom I would like to talk through the mental health impacts of Covid-19 more than the Traveller community.  It is a timely discussion.  I have a couple of questions.  I will start with the slightly dry question of the issues around data.  We hear over and over again at the health committee and this committee and in a number of other areas about a lack of data collection and the failure of the State to provide disaggregated data.  It is a particular problem in the health system.<\/p><p>Only a few weeks ago at the health committee, we heard from NGOs in the area of cardiovascular health and they said they could not get the long-term services that people recovering from stroke and heart disease require because they do not have access to the disaggregated data.  I cannot recall who said what gets measured gets done.  I am interested in the issue of allowing budgets to follow the numbers of people who need a service.  I would like to unpack that a little because there is a particular challenge with mental health given that it always sits on such a spectrum.  The witnesses are dealing with people who have significant challenges and are at risk of self-harm, but then there are cohorts that just need ongoing support.  I am mindful as well that we are trying to bring in well-being indicators which would affect budgets, but that is all predicated on having enough data to do that.  Could we talk about that for a moment?  What do the witnesses think the barriers are to that?  What we are hearing at other committees is that there is concern in particular Departments relating to GDPR and sometimes people are reluctant to provide particular information.  Do the witnesses think that healthcare staff or staff at the point of access to education or whatever else need training in how to broach that kind of data collection?  What do they think could be done?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#D00700","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1159,"content":"<p>My colleague, Ms Kavanagh might come in as well.  For us, it is ironic that we keep hearing from the State that it wants evidence-based planning and policies, yet it cuts the hands off us by not giving us the tools that would give us the evidence so that we can argue for what we know is needed.<\/p> <p>  Regading ethnic data, early on in Covid we knew that Travellers and Roma were more vulnerable and we asked the HSE, as far back as last March or April, to put ethnicity as a category on all the Covid tracking and testing information.  To be honest, it did finally get introduced, but again, as the Deputy said, some of the people did not feel comfortable and they did not ask the questions so it did not get implemented.  We had the experience of piloting the ethnicity question in the Rotunda Hospital more than 20 years ago.  Exactly as the Deputy said, we provided training to the staff on why they needed to do this.  We worked with Travellers, Roma and other minority ethnic groups to explain that this question would be asked and what the purpose of it was in order that both the service providers and the service users would understand.  We had 100% take-up and then after five months or so it went to zero.  We wondered what had gone wrong so we went in to find out.  The person who had been asking the question at the point of registration had gone on maternity leave and the new administrator did not feel comfortable asking the question, so it was not asked.  It just shows the importance of ongoing training.  Data disaggregated like this can be particularly sensitive but it is totally legal, and it must be done with a human rights framework, which means everybody gets asked the question, not just minorities.<\/p> <p>  Ms McDonnell gave the example of the maternity hospital.  Travellers have 20 times the rate of galactosemia, which means that if a baby is breastfed, brain damage could be caused.  They have to get the heel-prick test done quickly and get the results so that they are not exposed to danger but also facilitated to breastfeed.  Traveller women had come to me at the time and said they were being discriminated against as they were not allowed to use formula milk and they were given a special soya milk.  I thought that was most peculiar.  Being young at the time I went to hospital and asked what was gong on.  They explained the rationale, which was a very good one, but no one had explained it to Travellers.  They were experiencing it as discrimination when in fact it was well intentioned, which shows the importance of collaboration and education and training.<\/p> <p>  I asked how they knew so-and-so was a Traveller and they said it was by their name or address.  I said lots of Travellers live in houses and are now beginning to marry settled people.  There are different Traveller names.  Not every Joyce or McDonagh is a Traveller.  What they were doing was well intentioned but very poor practice.  That is why we would say in terms of human rights it should be a universal question that everybody is asked.  All of us should be asked the question.  It is based on the principle of voluntary self-identification.  One cannot be ascribed a label and be told one is a Traveller and be put in a box.  It is up to the individual to identify.  The information that is collected must only be used for the purpose for which it was collected and not for other purposes that would make people suspicious.  Ethnic data is really important.  It has to be done within a human rights framework, but consistent questions are needed.  That is why we recommend the census question on ethnicity.  Then we will have comparative data.  Although people may change jobs or Departments in the public service and Civil Service, they know why they are asking the question, because it is the same question no matter what Department or agency they are working in, and equally the service user knows.  It is the same as the way traditionally in Ireland people might have been asked their religion or gender.  It becomes the norm and then everybody understands.  That is what we promote.  Ms Kavanagh might want to talk about GDPR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1160,"content":"<p>To follow on from Ms Fay, there is no impediment to the collection of ethnic data as it relates to GDPR or data protection legislation.  That has been used as the rationale by some State agencies and Departments not to do it.  The Department of Education has an ethnic identifier in its primary school online database, which is its data collection system, and other State agencies have also implemented the ethic identifier.  Pavee Point worked to support the implementation and roll-out of the ethnic identifier.  That is one of the key issues and we are saying there is no legal impediment.  The Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed that.  Some of the barriers were highlighted by Deputy Hourigan and Ms Fay in terms of data collectors being uncomfortable asking the questions.  It is important that we build training mechanisms into any roll-out of the ethnic identifier.  Some 98% of people answer the census question.  It is the same question on ethnicity, which is a testament to the fact that people are very comfortable once they know the rationale for why it is being asked.  That is one of the key pieces to ensuring that where the ethnic question is introduced that people are given a clear rationale and that those who are asking it are also given adequate training.<\/p> <p>  Some mental health services have an ethnic identifier but others do not, so there are massive gaps and it is very much fragmented.

For anyone that is experiencing mental distress and reaching out for support, first and foremost, the support needs to be there and there should not be a worry.  The Deputy touched on young Travellers for example.  I worked with young Travellers, including my own nephews, and they said they worry about being discriminated against before it even happens.<\/p><p>We must think about the impact that has.  I will refer to our collaboration with the HSE.  This touches on the issue of the ethnic identifier that Ms Fay spoke about.  Members might be aware of the national service whereby people can text \"HELLO\" to 50808.  We worked with the HSE to train more than 500 volunteers.  The service now allows people to text \"Pavee\" to 50808.  The word \"Pavee\" is the word for \"Traveller\" in our language.  When the service sees the word \"Pavee\" in a text, it will know that a Traveller sent it.  We are catching Travellers there.  In the absence of the ethnic identifier, we cannot wait around.  It is as simple as that.  We worked with the HSE to provide this training.  It is a useful service for Travellers.  Travellers on a site or sitting outside on the step can text the service and get support.  There are people there who are trained up for that.<\/p><p> I will go back again to the idea that one shoe fits all.  I said this at a meeting during the term of the previous Oireachtas.  Services are tailored to deal with anyone who comes in the door.  Everyone is treated the same.  That has the potential to do more harm than good even though people might not think that is the case.  What works for one community might not work for another.  The importance of those data Ms Fay spoke about is that service providers like to know who is coming into their services.  They want to provide a good service.  With those data, providers can tailor their services to their service users.  It is therefore very important that these data are collected.  I am on a halting site at the minute.  If I fill the trailer with ten or 11 Traveller men and we make decisions for women without women present, how will those decisions fit when they fizzle down the line?  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  It was a broad question.  Ms Fay may have something to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Reilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1164,"content":"<p>It is important to note that Pavee Point and many other Traveller organisations always take an intersectional approach to our work.  We recognise that Travellers, Roma and other peoples are not homogenous groups.  Mental health is not homogenous either.  Traveller women's perinatal mental health is different from Traveller men's mental health.  We always adopt that intersectional approach.  As Mr. Reilly mentioned earlier, we always adopt both a mainstream and targeted approach to ensure that services are accessible for Travellers and are intercultural.  We work with our colleagues in the HSE to make sure that is the case.  As Mr. Reilly said, unless we have the data to allow us to identify people, it is very difficult for mainstream services to do that.  That is why we have spent the past 30 years talking about this <i>ad nauseum<\/i>.  To inform services and policies and to ensure equity across the board, data are needed.  That is the key point.  Such data are needed if we are to ensure the intersectional concerns the Deputy has raised can be addressed in an equitable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lynsey Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1165,"content":"<p>I know Senator Flynn cannot speak today so I will paraphrase her and say how important it is that mental health services meet people where they are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#F00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1166,"content":"<p>I am in the convention centre so I hope everybody can hear me okay.  I am in one of these great boxes with no light.  I thank Ms Fay, Ms Kavanagh and Mr. Reilly from the Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre for coming to speak to us.  I got to hear last week's very powerful session with the Galway Traveller Movement, Ms Kathleen Sweeney and Dr. Michael Ryan.  Dr. Ryan is a wonderful speaker and he had some great quotes.  He spoke about being an incurable optimist, which I thought was a wonderful way to describe a man who has been handling one of the most pressurised jobs in the world this year and trying to look at vulnerable populations.  He spoke about how the UN is a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves.  He spoke about change and about how, if we want to change things, we have to change how we think.  I have spoken about unconscious bias previously.  This is something we all have, whether we like it.  It is a result of our environment, education, society and many other factors.  With regard to unconscious bias, it is important that we all actively work to increase our awareness of our own actions.  Dr. Ryan spoke well in saying that it is not just a matter for the State, the Government or local authorities, but for all of us in society working together.  It is very important that all parts of society work together.<\/p> <p>  I will go through a few points on which I have taken notes and then ask a few questions, if we have time.  I apologise.  The division bells have started going off the very minute I get to speak.

Some key issues were spoken about, such as social determinants in the context of mental health.  Deputy Kenny mentioned the tsunami of mental health issues coming down the line.  That is very important.  I have a question for Ms Fay and Ms Kavanagh.  What are the areas we should focus on with regard to building awareness of bias?  What can we and our organisations do?<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the social determinants.  These include housing, accommodation, employment and education.  A wide range was mentioned.  It was an interesting debate.  It was about looking at the most vulnerable in the community.  I have an interest in two areas in particular.  I spoke with Ms Nora Corcoran, a project manager for the Galway Traveller Movement.  She had put together a report.  We might try to get an article about that event, how important it was and the quality of the speakers into our local magazine for Galway and Roscommon, which is based in Ballinasloe.  Ms Fay mentioned access to facilities and how the public health Act had superseded local government.  In our local area, the local authority provided water and Portaloos for families who were not living on proper halting sites.  This happens and I understand that.<\/p> <p>  Another element I will ask the witnesses about is that of education.  I know the Minister, Deputy Harris, indicated in March that approximately &euro;300,000 had been ring-fenced for higher education.  What has the impact of this been?  Another important point is that secondary school students sometimes do not have space to study.  As spokesperson on education, this is something I am conscious of.  We are trying to look at spaces.  In Ballinasloe, we have a study centre where space is provided.  However, it is not operated on a not-for-profit basis.  It is a facility offered to parents to accommodate their children studying in a focused way.  Could we consider using community spaces to allow children somewhere to study?  I may come in again at the end but those are my questions for now.  I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#F00600","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1169,"content":"<p>The bias the Senator has mentioned is an important issue.  The Black Lives Matter movement has made it more acceptable to talk about racism, which is what we are talking about.  We are talking about people being discriminated against but the State is not taking enough action.  We warmly welcome the development of a new national action plan against racism, which is under way.  It is key that the specific issues involved in anti-Traveller and anti-Roma racism are addressed in the plan and that the plan is not based on colour alone.  While colour is important, ethnicity is equally as important in an Irish context.  It is not about a hierarchy of oppression but about looking at the reality.  I talked earlier about the 134 excess deaths per year.  In our view, this is down to racism.  With regard to the national action plan against racism, we welcome the active engagement of Traveller representatives on the steering committee.  It is important that representatives of Traveller organisations are included in the mechanisms that are developed in respect of oversight and implementation of the plan.  It is great to see because the previous action plan ran out in 2008.  Despite our organisation and many UN bodies calling for it, the State has been slow to address the issue.  We warmly welcome that.<\/p><p>As the Senator said, Dr. Mike Ryan talked last week about deep biases in the way systems work and that everybody needs to take responsibility, including politicians on local authorities, who can feed racist rhetoric that results in people not being given basic human rights in terms of a safe place to live.  The Senator talked about the social determinants of health, mental health issues and their consequences.  In that context, an interesting figure from the census is that 40% of Traveller households have more people than rooms compared to 6% of the majority population.  It shows that Travellers are living in very overcrowded spaces and they have larger families and fewer rooms than the majority population.  I am not saying that a room to yourself is the answer to dealing with mental health issues or anything else but, clearly, having space is very important, whether it is to do homework or feed a baby.  All those broader social determinant issues need to be dealt with. <\/p><p> We have been looking for ethnic data from homeless services.  Again, it is meant to be on the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, but it is not disaggregated, collated or analysed and action is not based on it.  We know from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage figures that in excess of 13% of Travellers are homeless, which would be more than 600,000 people, were that figure aggregated up for the majority population.  Clearly, homelessness has a major impact on mental health, as Ms McDonnell said, particularly during the Covid pandemic. <\/p><p> As the Senator probably knows, since there are many Travellers in Ballinasloe, the extended family is very important to them, including the support they get from peers, parents, aunts, nieces and all of that, especially when a woman has a baby.  Normally, when the woman comes home she is looked after and other women do the housework, help with the cooking and cleaning and let her take six weeks off, which is the minimum needed to look after herself and her baby.  If someone is homeless, isolated and in substandard accommodation, that will clearly affect mental health because all the extended family support is missing.  <\/p><p> Pavee Point is very clear about the social determinants of health.  We have identified this in our work for the past 30 years, as we have for the right to health.  Healthcare has to be accessible, affordable, available and appropriate.  We know these things but, unfortunately, the State does not listen.  We have a particular challenge with the Department of Health in terms of the lack of priority it gives to Traveller health and its refusal to convene the Traveller health advisory committee since 2012.  The Department states it is all the responsibility of the HSE, whereas we say the Department is responsible for policy.  We need to be in there at policy design stage in order that we can promote an intercultural approach and are not seen as awkward when a policy comes out and we state that it excludes Travellers.  We are then seen as awkward and always complaining whereas if we were in there by design, we could anticipate some of the problems and that would, hopefully, build trust.  We certainly saw that during the Covid pandemic when we worked hand in hand with the State and managed to get some very good initiatives.  We hope that a joined-up Government approach, pooling of resources and responding to emergency needs will be a legacy of the pandemic.<\/p><p> Vulnerable members of the community were talked about.  Throughout the pandemic we highlighted the fact that there were particularly vulnerable Travellers and Roma and the State worked with us on that.  We need that to continue and we need the involvement of public health.  The Senator talked about education.  While there have been very important initiatives that we warmly welcome, and a new higher equity of access plan is being developed, getting a target in the last equity plan was what resulted in a real change in third-level access for Travellers.  We saw the numbers increasing and they have gone up - Ms Kavanagh might have the figure - from a very low base that has been doubled in the last five-year plan, which is really good.  <\/p><p> That is happening at third level but we need a comprehensive transformation of the education system.  We need a national Traveller education strategy, which is committed to in the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  This has to happen so we can look at early years, primary, secondary and third level education.  The ones who make it to third level are privileged but two thirds of Travellers have left school by 15 years of age.  We need to get them earlier and we need to have the groundwork done in order that we can bring about a transformation in Travellers' education experience and outcomes.  We need the ethnic data to be able to see what is happening.<\/p><p> We did training with St. Patrick's College a few years ago and some of the teachers there had returned from doing their teacher practice.  We asked them for feedback on what the experience was like and one of them was appalled.  She gave an example from a classroom she was in where the teacher asked the children what they wanted to be when they grew up.  The children said nurses, doctors, fire fighters and so on.  A Traveller child said he or she wanted to be a nurse but the teacher said \"Oh, you're going to get married\" and just skipped to the next person.  What was that telling the Traveller child if teachers have such low expectations?  I am not saying all teachers but unconscious bias-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>That is anecdotal.  It is very tough and we see this in all walks of life.  We cannot just pick out one grouping when it happens in all walks of life.  It would be great to get more training.  Funnily enough, this is an issue we are looking at in the education committee in the context of the roll-out of the FUSE programme.  That programme is about looking at areas of inclusion for children from all kind of backgrounds because we have a lot of different minority groups for many reasons, such as disabilities and so on, where children can be challenged.  There is a wider perspective here when it comes to bias.<\/p> <p>  On housing, we have seen the largest budget ever, more than &euro;3 billion, allocated to housing this year.  The Department has looked at reducing homelessness targets.  From my perspective, Galway County Council is the second-lowest funded council in the country and it is very important that we see resources allocated.  The Minister has noted that project teams will be assigned to housing within local authorities so that will be a higher resource.  The Minister also stated this year that the Department is looking to take more ownership of the allocation of Traveller housing by directly supporting local authorities in delivering that.<\/p> <p>  On the other areas Ms Fay mentioned, I note that Mr. Reilly mentioned the recommendations for which I thank him.  Ms. Fay mentioned the noting of ethnicity, which is done through the census.  I will highlight that the HSE has undergone an incredible year.  It has been our front line against this pandemic and it has saved everyone's lives.  I worked in National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway and I had the opportunity to work in health innovation in University Hospital Galway, UHG, and, as with anything, which is incredible, they triage based on need.  That is how the health service works.  It is those who are in most need of medical attention that get immediate attention.  It is incredible that that is how it has to be triaged.  <\/p> <p>  There has been a lack of beds, supports and everything else but there has been incredible investment this year in health alone.  The community healthcare west organisation has a specific grouping looking at mental health within the CHO in that area.  It has conducted workshops on inclusion and diversity that particularly looked at issues with a Traveller voice.  Mr. Reilly spoke about \"nothing for us without us\" so it is very important that we are looking at having more of these workshops where we are speaking and ensuring that our voices, and Traveller voices, are heard. <\/p> <p>  On the ethnicity issue, again, that information is gathered through the census.  On the HSE gathering data and having registers, there are so many areas for which we do not have registers.  We do not have a register for diabetics or diabetes.  We are talking here as if it is very simple matter but there are many things for which we do not have registers.  It is probably a case of the HSE and the healthcare system not being as advanced as we would like them to be in terms of software, online or electronic medical health records.  We saw all of these issues, and they are being looked at now, during the vaccine roll-out.<\/p><p>Now is the period in which there is an investment into the healthcare system and into looking at how we can bring an awful lot more of our systems in healthcare online and we would be able to gather more data in a better way and gather the information that is needed to form an evidence base for policy.<\/p><p> I welcome the information from Ms Kavanagh on GDPR.  I was not aware of it.  I was going to ask that question.  She has caught me before I asked it.  I have taken on board the two areas Mr. Reilly mentioned.  With regard to the Traveller health report,  I do not know if he wants to make any other comment on that, but I thank him for highlighting the recommendations and I take that on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#G00200","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1173,"content":"<p>One of the other pragmatic approaches to looking at inclusion is the implementation of section 42 of public sector duty.

That could also be looked at because public bodies should be doing that already.  It is really important.  With regard to the other point around registries, it is not that we are looking for registries, we are looking at where data collection systems exist at the moment where the ethnic question could be built into those systems to inform services and policies.  It is not that we are looking for a whole different system to be put in place, but we know the HSE has capacity in this area.  As I said earlier, there are examples of services that have an ethnic identifier in place but it is not being used; the data might not be collected; might not be collected in line with human rights approaches; and is not used to inform services and policies.

Part of our ethnic equality monitoring processes requires us to quality proof.  That is why we are saying we need stakeholder engagement and Traveller proofing in all of these things.  I take on board the complexities.  We originally piloted the ethnic issue on the HYPE and then discovered it did not talk to the GPs.  We have been there.  Initially, when we looked for the ethnicity, we were told there were computer problems, then we were told there were personnel issues.  We have a long history of trying.  Taking a pragmatic approach and making sure that it benefits a whole range of groups is really important.  We are ready, willing and able.<\/p> <p>  We harnessed the Traveller infrastructure among Traveller organisations but especially Traveller primary health care projects and did our best to mitigate the impact of Covid-19.  As Senator Dolan has said, last week, the committee heard examples from Ms Kathleen Sweeney who is co-ordinator down at the Galway Traveller Movement, GTM.  The irony is that many of those workers are on minimum wage and barely get 12 hours per week and if they go over a certain point, they lose their medical cards.  One of the things we have been asking the State to do is recognise the important role of primary healthcare projects and give all Travellers, given their health inequities, the benefit of a medical card until such time as the health inequities are levelled up.<\/p> <p>  We do not think that is too big of an ask because given that 80% of Travellers are unemployed, the majority have a medical card anyway.  However, for these key people who have the trust of the community and the partnership with the State agencies, there is a real danger we will lose some of them.  We also need to look at their terms and conditions in order that they are better remunerated and people who have worked for 20 or 30 years in this really different work should not have to retire with nothing.  Their terms and conditions need to be looked at.  As I said, we need the Traveller health action plan.  There has been no increase in the core funding for Traveller health in terms of the health development money.  There has been once-off dormant accounts and that kind of funding since 2008, before austerity.  We are seeing the impact of that and we need urgent publication, implementation, budgets indicators, timelines and resources for the implementation of the Traveller health action plan, given that Traveller health is at crisis point and given that has exacerbated the mental health issues that predated Covid-19.  I do not know if Mr. Reilly or Ms McDonnell want to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ronnie Fay"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>I was going to come in and speak about what Ms Fay covered in the second half of her piece, with regard to the importance of the primary healthcare projects.

Traveller infrastructure needs to be taken seriously.  It is far too long saying \"we need to be doing this and that\".  We have great examples of the positive and great work we are doing.  That needs to be at the forefront.  We are here.  We are ready to do this and we did not just come here today and whinge and moan although God knows, we have much to whinge and moan about.

With regard to the primary healthcare workers, I see them as the most important Traveller workers.<\/p><p>In the context of Covid-19, when everyone was told to keep their distance, stay away and keep to themselves, the primary healthcare workers have been putting themselves in that situation, have been going out on the ground, collecting the work and giving support to other Travellers in a very serious situation while having the added stress and worry for themselves of going out onto the sites if they were not living there and possibly bringing the virus back home.  That has a great impact on a person's health and overall mental health.<\/p><p> Ms Fay made a point earlier about the example of one teacher in school.  I was engaged young, but when I was engaged to be married it was not a case of me thinking that I was going to get married and drop out of school or that I did not want education and did not want to work.  However, when I came into school one of my teachers noticed that I was wearing an engagement ring.  I was also called aside and told: \"Geraldine, it is okay if you do not have the homework in this week, it is okay if you do not attend this class and it is okay if you do this.\"  I was told all these things that it was okay not to do, whereas the previous week I was told to have my work in, to have something done and that I needed to be in school.  It was assumed that I was just going to get married now that I had an engagement ring and that I did not need education.  These are the barriers that Travellers are facing.<\/p><p> Then there is an added thing.  I was in a large secondary school.  I was the only Traveller in my year of more than 90 girls.  There is the added pressure that there are not many Travellers in education, and one is also being singled out and highlighted in front of one's peers at a young age.  That has an impact on one's mental health at a time when overall mental health for teenagers is very important.  A young person's image among his or her classmates and peers is very important for the young person, and not just for a Traveller.  However, when somebody is being called up in front of her classmates and being highlighted, as to whether she is going to get married and whether she will drop out of school, it adds an extra little layer to an issue somebody already would not need when in school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021071300002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Geraldine McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1183,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonnell and Ms Fay.

First, I am inspired by your fantastic presentations.  I have worked with the Traveller community with an organisation called the RISE Foundation.  I learned from phenomenal women in the Traveller community.  I looked on them as warrior women, to be honest, because of the daily discrimination they had to face.  People do not really understand it.  I think about it to this day, what it is like even to walk down the street and have comments made.  There was one story about a woman who got a house in a housing estate.  There was a little green outside the housing estate and she sent her little boy, who was only five or six years of age, to play football with the other children.  He went out, played and had great fun with the children.  On the next day he was sent out the children were told not to play with him.  That is the daily discrimination.  There was devastation for that family and for the little boy.  I still carry it with me today.<\/p> <p>  I hear what our guests are saying.  I thank Geraldine McDonnell for her fantastic presentation.  Mr. Patrick Reilly's recommendations were very powerful and they will definitely go into our report.  I worry about implementation and action.  I understand his comment about the many reports and conversations.  There is no doubt that we need more action and we need to change.  We need to change the discrimination that happens every day to the Traveller community.  I believe there is hope with having Senator Eileen Flynn in the Oireachtas.  She is a powerhouse.  I am very happy that she is a colleague and I know she is doing great work here, so there is hope in here with Senator Flynn.<\/p> <p>  I thank you all.  I did have a few questions but perhaps we can have you in at another time.  They were about alcohol harm and mental health and whether alcohol harm has increased in the Traveller community.  However, perhaps we will return to that at another time.  We appreciate you attending the meeting today and I am sorry that we have run out of time.

I thank them for participating, given that the notice given to them of this meeting was short.  The committee has sought to be constructive regarding the EU digital green certificate.  Today, we are dealing with the public service side and the implementation team.  The Minister of State with responsibility for this matter, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will be before us tomorrow.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.  For witnesses who are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contributions to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chair, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask for everyone's forbearance should technical issues arise.  The public will be interested in what the witnesses' will say on the up-to-date position on the digital green certificate, particularly with 19 July looming next Monday.  I call on Ms Canavan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021071300002#A00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to this meeting to discuss our implementation of the EU digital Covid certificate.  I am the chair of the <i>ad hoc<\/i>subgroup of the senior officials group on Covid-19.  The group was established to monitor and update the Government on all operational risks associated with the implementation of the EU digital Covid certificate and the public health risks associated with the easing of restrictions, particularly in light of the progress of the disease and the emergence of variants.<br\/><br\/>The EU digital Covid certificate regulation entered into application on 1 July.  It was developed to facilitate safe free movement of citizens in the EU during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The European Commission has built a gateway through which all certificate signatures can be verified across the EU.  On 29 June, Ireland joined the gateway.  This means that digital Covid certificates issued in Ireland are recognised by authorities in other EU member states and that Ireland can verify digital Covid certificates for travellers arriving from other EU member states and apply the public health rules associated with those certificates.<br\/><br\/>As a pilot run on 1 July, which was &quot;go live&quot; day for the digital Covid certificate service across Europe, Ireland issued its initial digital Covid certificates, including the necessary digital signature attesting to the fact it was issued by the Irish issuing authority.  On the same day, we had a team working at our ports and airports verifying the QR codes of travellers.  On 9 July, Ireland published its travel rules, one of only four countries to do so at that stage.<br\/><br\/>Implementation of the EU digital Covid certificate cuts across a number of Departments and Government agencies.  The challenge is that many Departments and agencies are involved in related Covid-19 projects, policy and legislative developments that connect with the implementation of the certificate.  The role of the group has been to develop a unified project co-ordinating the respective efforts of colleagues around the system, identify potential risks and gaps, and progress mitigations and alternative solutions to identified gaps and risks.<\/p><p>Thanks to my colleagues right across the Civil Service and the public service, we have made good progress to date on implementing what is a large and complex programme that has required delivery in a tight timeline.  On their behalf, I will give the committee a brief overview of the approach being taken.  <br\/><br\/>Our primary focus was to fulfil our EU obligations in a robust and effective way, including operability by 1 July in context of EU compliance and delivery of certificates to eligible members of the public in line with Government&rsquo;s proposed lifting of restrictions on non-essential travel on 19 July.  In doing so, we had to be very mindful of developing the certificate in a way that provides the greatest assurance, in line with data protection, as regards sensitive personal information.  A group involving the relevant Departments and agencies, many represented today, have been meeting regularly in plenary session to deliver on the project since the end of May when the Government agreed the group's establishment.<br\/><br\/>On the generation of certificates, in light of significant pressures on the HSE and particular ICT teams following the cyberattack, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, has undertaken the certificate generation process on behalf of Government.  Digital Covid-19 certificates for vaccination and recovery are being produced by the OGCIO using data provided by the HSE.  Vaccination certificates are being pushed out.  This approach is enabling us to get certificates to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>In respect of vaccinated persons,  the vaccine certificates are being sent out by email where a verified email address is available.  That will mainly be the case for people who registered on the vaccine portal.  Where no email address is available, vaccine certificates are being posted out to home addresses.  That applies mainly to those who have been vaccinated through GPs.  Where there is insufficient contact information to send out a certificate, a call centre will be available from 19 July through which a vaccine certificate can be requested once a person&rsquo;s identity and eligibility have been verified.  As regards persons who have recovered from Covid-19, recovery certificates will also be available upon request through the call centre, subject to verifiable evidence of recovery from a prior infection within the previous 180 days.<br\/><br\/>An upgraded version of the Covid tracker application will be available shortly.  This will allow people to upload a paper or PDF version of their certificate to a wallet on their phone.  The Covid tracker application serves as a pandemic response tool and currently carries a number of functions that are independent of each other.  It will be possible for people to disable those features and use the tracker solely as a digital wallet to store their digital Covid certificate on their phone, should they wish to do so.<br\/><br\/>Data to support certification is the purview of the Department of Health and the HSE.  The HSE has multiple data sources for vaccine and recovery data including, for example, the vaccine portal, GPs, pharmacies and acute hospital settings.  The data quality is varied.  Extensive data quality work has been undertaken to ensure sufficient and fully accurate information is available to support both generation and issuing of the certificate to an individual.  That work is well advanced and as regards 1.9 million vaccinated persons, this data is available to allow for the generation of these certificates on a push basis.<br\/><br\/>It was necessary to undertake extensive data validation on the vaccination data as many people did not always provide their full contact details, particularly prior to the public portal.  In addition, efforts were made to minimise instances whereby certificates are sent to people who have deceased.  Work on data relating to persons who have recovered from Covid-19 is continuing apace.  Given the quality of this data and the relatively smaller numbers involved, it has been decided to provide recovery certifications on a pull basis, that is, on request.  This will enable us to complete missing data fields, authenticate identify and ensure address and email for issuing of the certificate are accurate and up to date. <br\/><br\/>I will now discuss the generation of certificates based on a negative or not-detected test.  Those certificates will be provided through private operators who meet minimum entry requirements including, for example, the use of tests approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, an ID verification process, the use of medical professionals and data entry requirements.  An information notice to prospective test providers on accessing the digital service required to generate a digital Covid certificate was published last week.  To provide citizens with an EU digital Covid certificate, Covid-19 testing providers of both nucleic acid amplification tests, NAATs, including RT-PCR and rapid antigen, will be provided with access to the EU digital test certificate service, operated by the OGCIO within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Access to this service will allow test providers to generate EU digital test certificates for all negative or not-detected test results, in line with national and EU regulations.  Approved access to the EU digital Covid test certificate service is contingent on test providers being compliant with the relevant national and EU regulations in respect of SARS-CoV-2 testing, associated public health measures and the standards and obligations detailed in the standard operating procedure.  Prior to receiving access to the service for test certificate generation, providers are required to review and digitally sign the standard operating procedure and return by email to digitalcovidcerts.business@per.gov.ie.<br\/><br\/>On the question of services for people who were not vaccinated in Ireland, the EU regulation gives the option to issue vaccination certificates to persons vaccinated elsewhere, with EMA approved vaccines, upon receipt of appropriate proof.The main development focus at the moment is on the delivery of the obligations of the EU regulation in respect of persons who received a vaccination or a test in Ireland.  Arrangements for provision of vaccination certificates to persons not vaccinated in Ireland, including Irish passport holders vaccinated in Northern Ireland, will be considered once the initial roll-out is in place.  Discussions are ongoing between the European Commission and third countries with a view to facilitating interoperability and mutual recognition of certificates.<br\/><br\/>It should be noted that the EU digital Covid certificate is not a travel document and the possession of an EU digital Covid certificate will not be a precondition to exercise free movement rights.  Therefore, travellers who do not have a digital Covid certificate can provide other verifiable forms of proof of vaccination or a valid negative test.<br\/><br\/>I will move on to the passenger locator form.  Passengers entering Ireland must fill in the Covid-19 passenger locator form before they arrive in Ireland.  Failure to do so is an offence.  The Covid-19 passenger locator form is now an online form.  As of 12 July, carriers are obliged to check for a completed electronic passenger locator form before allowing passengers to board or embark.  Through enhancements to the electronic passenger locator form, which are currently under development, travellers will be required to make a statutory declaration as to their travel status, that is, whether they are vaccinated, recovered or in possession of a negative or not-detected test and form of proof.  This determines what other public health advice, quarantine or testing measures will be applicable to the passenger, depending on what country they are arriving from.  <br\/><br\/>Once operational, the enhanced electronic passenger locator form receipt will identify those who have a certificate of an EMA-approved vaccination or recovery or negative PCR test or who are otherwise exempt from the requirement to have such a test.  For those travelling on a vaccine or recovery certificate, no further pre-departure checks are required by carriers.  Passengers travelling on a negative PCR test will be required to provide proof to the carrier of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of arrival or will be denied boarding.  Passengers arriving from designated states who have pre-booked a place in mandatory hotel quarantine will be met at the aircraft and escorted separately from other passengers through the airport building for check-in as required.  Currently children aged six and under do not need to take a PCR test prior to travelling to Ireland.  The age limit is currently being reviewed. <br\/><br\/>A verifier application has been developed to support checks of the digital Covid certificate, which allows a mobile device, for example, a phone, to scan the QR code on the certificate in either paper or electronic form.  The border management unit and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will conduct spot checks of public health documentation, including the digital Covid certificate, at ports of entry to the State for the purpose of ensuring the integrity of the enhanced public health travel regime.  The verifier application for checking the digital Covid certificate is available to the carriers, should they wish to avail of it. <br\/><br\/>It is acknowledged that there is considerable complexity associated with travel at the moment given the impact of Covid-19 worldwide.  Part of the work of the group has been to provide a unified source of information for the public.  There is comprehensive information on both the digital Covid certificate and international travel in general on <i>gov.ie\/travel <\/i>and Both web pages will be kept up to date with all the latest information. <br\/><br\/>A digital Covid certificate call centre is being established to take calls, provide support and resolve queries for citizens who have been vaccinated and received certificates.  It will also resolve issues for those citizens who require a certificate but have not yet received one or are requesting recovery certificates, having recovered from Covid.  The contact centre has been created at exceptional pace to manage the required workflows and communications, while meeting all data protection requirements.  This has required an incredible effort across multiple Government agencies to put in place the people, processes and technology required.  An interim emergency line will be operational from today.  We are prioritising queries for people who are travelling in the near future and have received their certificate and may have queries on that certificate.  A fully capable centre will be available from Monday, 19 July.  This line will be focused on dealing with urgent queries only over the coming days and, therefore, we are requesting that only those with an urgent query contact the centre this week.<\/p><p>The service will be ramped up significantly between now and 19 July, when a full call centre service will be available.  Meanwhile, travellers can access the most up-to-date information through <i>gov.ie\/travel<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Data protection has been the subject of ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commission to ensure the process is fully compliant with GDPR regulations.  The requisite data controller and data processing agreements are in place for any data transfers in respect of the generation of the certificate.  All other requisite processor and sub-processor agreements will be in place prior to any further transfer of data.<br\/><br\/>On the position as of today, 160,000 paper vaccination certificates were posted yesterday and are due to arrive in homes today.  Approximately 1 million emails will issue between yesterday and tomorrow.  Altogether, it is anticipated that more than 1.8 million certificates will have been delivered by 19 July.  The certificates are generated based on available information and there may be circumstances where information needs to be updated on certificates.  This can be done through the call centre.  A small number of private operators have already signed up to provide certificates and further information on relevant providers will be made available in due course.<br\/><br\/>Work is continuing on making the necessary enhancements to the electronic passenger locator form for 19 July.  The Department of Transport has been engaging with carriers on their role as part of the verification process and to update them more generally on progress on the implementation of the digital Covid certificate and enhanced electronic passenger locator form.<br\/><br\/>In summary, progress is continuing apace on the implementation of the EU digital Covid certificate.  The challenges involved should not be underestimated but from the technological developments that were required to be stood up at pace, data governance arrangements and scaling up of all operational matters throughout the end-to-end solution, we are on track for the system to be operational for the reopening of non-essential travel on 19 July.

As Beaumont Hospital, for example, might be the address, we contacted our health service providers and all of our facilities so that they had arrangements in place to distribute those as quickly as possible as they arrived.  There will be issues during that period but as Ms Canavan has said, the call centre will be one mechanism to tackle that.

We managed to sustain the vaccination and testing and tracing systems.  We had many issues relating to logistics and operations, which had to be done manually during that period.  There were some issues relating to GP data, GP referrals and so on.  One of the biggest impacts was on the staff.  They were operating 24-7, essentially trying to build a vaccination system as we ran out a programme at pace.  As a result of the cyberattack, they have now been sucked into that.  As Ms Canavan noted in her opening statement, Mr. Lowry and his team at the OGCIO stepped in to support the wider development of the technology to implement this.  One of the key impacts related to some of the resources.  Those teams were already fully stretched with testing and tracing and vaccination systems and then had to deal with the cyber attack.  They have been working almost every weekend.  Members will be aware that pharmacies are now on board in the context of a new opt-in model within the vaccination programme.  To illustrate the efforts of the staff, I point to the fact that last weekend they performed a major upgrade on the vaccination system to allow the pharmacy data to be brought in live, while also working with Mr. Lowry and the team to get the data transferred.  Those are some of the key impacts on the resourcing side and expertise, but also in terms of some of the practical areas I mentioned earlier relating to systems that just were not accessible and for which we did not have data for a considerable period after the cyberattack, with GP data being the primary example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021071300002#G02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1307,"content":"<p>It is probably worth stating that notwithstanding that we have done our best to wrap ourselves around the staff of Mr. McCallion, there has been significant work in the data clean-up and the expertise and know-how locally in terms of managing everything and, indeed, our concerns relating to data protection being ensured.<\/p><p>It is not that they have had all of the load lifted from them, but we have tried to wrap around it as best we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021071300002#G02300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Canavan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1309,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Canavan and her team very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021071300002#H00200","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1310,"content":"<p>When the 160,000 certificates are issued to the people by post today and the 1 million over yesterday, today and tomorrow, are those certificates issued two weeks after the recommended period after which one has the full effect of the vaccine?

Mr. McCallion covered many of the points I wanted to make about the Civil Service in general and the public service we have, the workload that they have been under for the past 18 months, and the way that they have turned things around in terms of supports and everything that has been addressed.

We have some made some calculations as to what the level of demand might be but we will obviously have to keep that under review and we are aware of that.<br\/><br\/>I do not have the helpline times off the top of my head.  It is not from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but it is not 6 a.m. to midnight either and is somewhere in the middle, if memory serves me correctly.

We will try to capture errors on certificates and any calls that require resolution that we cannot resolve until the full call centre is set up will be held, processed, logged and ready for processing on 19 July.  We ask people to have patience over the next number of days so that they are not ringing up and clogging up that line for people who may have urgent travel requirements.<br\/><br\/>On the US and proofs, we covered a little bit of this ground earlier.

All of this information is coming in but some people will take a leap of faith and travel.  The letter could then arrive in the post when the neighbours are over feeding the cats and dogs.  The neighbours will notice the digital green certificate has arrived.  How does that correlate, when that vital information comes in, if the person is already out of the country?<\/p> <p>  The third question is on what happens if the scientific information changes.  I caught some of this earlier in the debate.  Right now, the digital Covid certificate will last for an indefinite duration because the individual is vaccinated.  It is believed that this will continue going forward.  However, scientific information may change and there is some suspicion that it might, on foot of some information from Israel.  If the efficacy of the vaccine reduces in the months ahead, and booster shots are needed, how will that be reflected in certification?  I am bundling my questions and I might come in again briefly later.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, what happens if a person travels a day or two before their digital Covid certificate is issued?  I am aware that the guidance is to wait until 19 July 2021.  However, this is like trying to keep lambs in a field.  Once people heard that the date of 19 July 2021 was the possible date of travel, some people immediately started looking at what flights were available.  A few have booked to fly on 17 or 18 July 2021.  What can people in that category expect when they go to an airport?  It is 24 or 48 hours out from this regime being in place.  They are anxious to know what they will face.  I understand that 19 July 2021 is the official date but as we approach those dates, it is important to give some guidance.<\/p> <p>  My fifth question is on where the check will happen.  I heard a previous contributor say that the carrier will check the digital Covid certificate.  As someone prepares to fly from an airport, will this happen at check-in?  Will it be at the passport screening point?  Will it be at the departure gate?  Where will it happen? I apologise for bundling my questions.  Finally, will there be any indication of live waiting times?  Britain is a little ahead of us on all of this and British national news agencies, including Sky News and the BBC, have on a daily basis provided live trackers of waiting times at airports.  I direct this question in particular to Ms Canavan.  The Department of the Taoiseach, the heart of the Government, should have some official communication, like it has had all along for Covid-19 figures each evening.  It would be important in the initial weeks, as people get into this new regime, to have some indication of live waiting times.  Those are my six questions and I hope the witnesses can come back on some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021071300002#L01600","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1626130800,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>My colleagues have been evacuated from the Department of Health, so they are not on the line at the moment.

If the letter comes while you are abroad, and we talked about this earlier, and if you have a neighbour minding the cats, they can open your letter, photograph it and send it to you.  The QR code will transfer and it will be readable in that way, so there is a work-around on that.  Obviously, you can pick up your email abroad, if you are getting it by email.  However, it can be photographed and photocopied.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the science changing, what the Deputy set out is correct.  For the vaccination, at the moment validity is indefinite, as he said.  The science may change on that, but that is what the EU rules are at the moment and we are working on the basis of that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of recovery, validity is 180 days.  That will be the duration of the validity for a DCC based on recovery.  PCR or antigen tests will have a more limited validity.  In general terms, PCR is considered to have a 72-hour validity and antigen a 48-hour validity.  The digital Covid certificates based on the tests are of much shorter duration.<\/p> <p>  Regarding travel delays, we are advising people to check in advance everything relating to their travel arrangements and that they have everything they need.  To be clear, the main document they will need to enter this country will be the electronic passenger locator form.  They will not be allowed to board without it.  The carriers are carrying out the check for that at time of boarding, so it is necessary to have that form completed and to have a receipt to show it has been completed.  The electronic format is live now.  The requirement for carriers to ensure they have checked for the EPLF before boarding is in place since yesterday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021071300002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Elizabeth Canavan"},{"type":"speech","time":1626130800,"counter":1399,"content":"<p>I suggest the departure gate is rather late in the system, given that everything from the boarding card to the passport is screened further back in the airport concourse.

There will be people who will try to wriggle their way out of this, not having been tested, and they will be at the point of departure, holding it up for everyone.  I would suggest a better place to do whatever screening is required would be further back in the airport concourse, before reaching the actual departure gate.  We do not want flights to be delayed.  We have had few enough flights taking off over the last few months, and the last thing we want is a kerfuffle before people board a plane.<\/p> <p>  Members of this committee have been huge advocates of antigen testing.
