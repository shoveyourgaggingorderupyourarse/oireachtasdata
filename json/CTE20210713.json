I welcome everyone to the meeting.  Due to the situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is attending remotely.<\/p> <p>  Today we engage with officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Department of Health.  This engagement is a continuation of our meeting in February and we will resume our examination of the board's 2019 financial statements.<\/p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the board: Mr. David Gunning, chief officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance officer.<\/p> <p>  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by officials from the Department of Health: Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary of health infrastructure and Ms Fiona Prendergast, acting director of health infrastructure.  All of the witnesses are very welcome.<\/p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give their evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege.  Today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statement on the board's financial statements in February and it was recirculated to the committee before this meeting.

I thank the committee for inviting the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, today via video link to provide an update on the construction progress on the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I am the chief officer at the NPHDB and I am joined this morning by Mr. Phelim Devine, project  director; Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director; and Mr. Jim Farragher, finance manager.<\/p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8, and two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Connolly, Blanchardstown, and Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Tallaght.  The national children's hospital project, NCH, a government priority, will have a significant impact on the healthcare outcomes of  25% of the population once completed and is the most significant single capital investment project in the healthcare system ever undertaken in Ireland.  It will bring together the services currently provided at the three children&rsquo;s hospitals into one modern, custom-designed, digital hospital where staff will  deliver the best care and treatments to Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children and young people.<\/p> <p>  The NPHDB&rsquo;s 2019 accounts were audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General on 17 June 2020.  The expenditure as of 31 December 2019 for that year on the design and build of the hospital was &euro;199,622,610.  The NPHDB&rsquo;s 2020 accounts are currently being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General  and will be finalised shortly.  We have provided in the statement a brief table showing the 2019, 2020 and cumulative to the end of 2020 expenditure. <\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the construction update.  The new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre, CHI at Connolly was opened in July 2019 and is already fully operational.  On the CHO Tallaght update, it is a priority for the NPHDB and indeed all stakeholders to open the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Tallaght in 2021 and we are pleased to report that we are on target to do that.  Members will see from the images distributed as part of the briefing pack that construction work on the 4,600 m2 centre is nearing an end with a substantial completion date scheduled for September 2021.  It will then be handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open for services after an eight-week period of operational commissioning and equipping.  The works at Tallaght are nearing completion.<\/p><p>Final internal works comprise painting, commissioning, cleaning and snagging.  External works comprise final pavements and landscaping.  The work on the OPD centre at Tallaght included a significant investment in the adult hospital which involved the delivery of a new changing and administration block, a new creche and the upgrade of roads, pavements, car park and electrical infrastructure.<\/p><p> Progress on the main new children&rsquo;s hospital is also continuing at pace.  The primary concrete frame was completed in March 2021.  The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame closing in the concourse will be completed by August 2021, as will the unitised glazing to the ward block at levels 4 to 6.  The fa&ccedil;ade will be complete by the end of 2021, with the glazed biome that links the building to be completed by the end of the first quarter of next year.  The fit-out of the south finger rooms, comprising outpatients, cardiology and therapies, and the hot block rooms, comprising emergency department, imaging, critical care and theatres, are progressing well.  The remainder of the fit-out of the north finger rooms, comprising outpatients, the hospital school, third level education, parent overnight accommodation, pharmacy and the ward block rooms, will commence in the next month.  The primary mechanical and electrical plant, comprising boilers, combined heat and power plant, generators, transformers, main distribution boards and medical gases, are well progressed, with the focus now on primary and secondary distribution around the site.<\/p><p> On equipping, some of the group 1 medical equipment, such as theatre and critical care pendants, are currently being installed.  The group 2 equipment, comprising automated guided vehicles and clinical decontamination unit equipment, is in procurement.  The balance of the group 2 equipment, such as MRIs, CTs and other advanced diagnostic equipment, will commence procurement in the next quarter.<\/p><p> Sustainability is embedded in the design of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  The hospital very recently received a BREEAM excellent rating in design and is one of only a small number of hospitals in the world to have achieved such a rating.  BREEAM is the world&rsquo;s leading sustainability assessment method for major projects.<\/p><p> On the topic of wider construction sector challenges, the global pandemic, Covid-19, has disrupted the construction sector and all its supply chains both nationally and internationally.  The NCH project has not been immune to this.  In 2020, both the construction of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Tallaght outpatients and urgent care centre were closed for a period following the arrival of Covid in Ireland.  In 2021, the sites remained open during the level 5 lockdown.  The contractor introduced extensive health and safety measures, which include weekly screening and PCR testing for all workers, and more than 5,000 tests were conducted during the month of June.<\/p><p> It is acknowledged by all stakeholders that Covid and Brexit will likely place pressure on the availability of essential supplies in the market globally.  The construction sector is facing challenges related to the supply of market essentials as a result of increased global demand and shortages driven by Covid-related factory shutdowns, production disruption and inventory depletion.  In addition, it is reported that there are Brexit-related import delays and constraints.  This is a global challenge, one that is not unique to the construction sector, but one that will have potential impacts on the project, with cost and lead time uncertainty.  The contractor continues to work through these challenges and will manage the risks.<\/p><p> With regard to the timeline, as outlined to this committee in December 2020, there are delays to the programme of works.  We have previously reported to the committee that we did not have a compliant programme from the contractor.  I am delighted to be able to report to the committee that a compliant programme was submitted by the contractor in March 2021 and has been determined by the employer&rsquo;s representative, ER.  This, in itself, is a major milestone for the project.  With over 40,000 separate activities to be completed over the course of the build, the programme details each and every one, ensuring that it is in the right sequence and at the right phase of the build.  By determining the programme as compliant, the ER has essentially confirmed that it is feasible to complete the construction phase within the timeframe set out.  This is only feasible if the project is executed and resourced efficiently by the contractor and its subcontractors, and if all other external factors, including Brexit and Covid, do not impact on supply issues and goods and services.  The compliant programme takes account of the known delays, and all stakeholders are fully aligned around the goal of opening the hospital in 2024.  The NPHDB and the main contractor are engaged in a series of workshops to map out the detail within the programme to take account of the risks that remain and to make every effort to ensure that the target date can be achieved.<\/p><p> As part of the combined effort to achieve delivery of the programme within the shortest timeframe possible, all dispute mechanisms have been paused for a period of time.  This moratorium has been agreed, which enables the parties to focus all their efforts on ensuring that the new target completion date can be realised.  This does not remove the risk of claims, nor does it mean that we will not continue to receive claims.  Claims will continue to be determined by the employer&rsquo;s representative as set out in the contract.  We have provided an information document as an appendix to this document setting out the current position with contractor claims on the NCH and on Tallaght.<\/p><p> With regard to cost, the Government approved an investment decision of &euro;1.433 billion for the project.  This investment decision excludes items where there was no price certainty, nor can there be certainty for the duration of the project.  These include construction inflation, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting from healthcare policy changes and also the sectoral employment order.  While we now have a compliant programme, the target completion date for the programme is 14 months later than that set out within the contract.  Any elongation of the programme will lead to additional cost.  There are potential cost implications in regard to Covid-related delays, costs associated with additional health and safety measures, as well as ongoing claims that have the potential to contribute to the overall costs.  These matters, as well as those associated with any change to the programme duration, are currently subject to commercial mechanisms and are part of the live contract that exists between the NPHDB and BAM, the main contractor.  Therefore, I am not in a position to elaborate further at this time as it could compromise our ability to negotiate on behalf of the State.  There is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice enforcement of the existing contract and very likely negatively impact or jeopardise our current engagements with the contractor.<\/p><p> On project governance, the NPHDB reports to the children&rsquo;s hospital project and programme, CHP&amp;P, steering group on a monthly basis, providing comprehensive updates on risks to costs and programme, including all aspects of the project.  We also report to the CHP&amp;P board.  We continue to work closely with officials in the Department of Health and the HSE, as well as with colleagues in Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the children&rsquo;s hospital is taking shape and the outpatients centre at Tallaght is nearing completion.  Significant progress has been made, as is evident from the photographs and video that we have provided.  The project continues to have challenges.  However, we are moving forward with a spirit of co-operation with the main contractor and with all of our stakeholders to ensure that this badly needed hospital is delivered as soon as possible.  I look forward to answering any questions the committee members might have on the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021071300002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Gunning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626165000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am director in the health infrastructure division.  I was hoping to be joined by my colleague, Mr. Derek Tierney.  He is having some connectivity issues and, hopefully, he will join us shortly.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge that the committee has requested a detailed update on the current status.  The Department has previously written to indicate there are commercial sensitivities and elements which are confidential due to the fact there is a live contract in place, and there is an extremely high likelihood that any discussion on costs, however hypothetical, would prejudice engagement between the parties and could very likely negatively impact or jeopardise this project.<\/p><p>The children&rsquo;s hospital is the most significant capital investment programme ever undertaken in Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system.  It is a Government priority project and will bring together the services currently provided at three children&rsquo;s hospitals into a modern, custom-designed, world-class digital hospital to deliver the best care and treatments for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children.<\/p><p> Despite the obvious challenges the Covid-19 pandemic has imposed on us all, significant progress has been made on the project.  Mr. Gunning and colleagues have spoken to the specifics but the distinctive shape of the building is now clear.  The fit-out of certain internal areas has begun and rooms and clinical areas now discernible.  On a recent site visit, we got a real sense of how welcoming an environment it will be for children, their families and CHI staff, with lots of natural light and break-out spaces in addition to the world class health facilities.<\/p><p> I understand that committee members will be visiting the site tomorrow and will see at first hand the progress on the ground.  It it will become clear to members that this is not just a hospital.  It is effectively a new village to provide for Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children, their families and the healthcare professionals who will care for them.  There will be gardens, recreational facilities, a school for the patients and a university campus for future healthcare professionals.<\/p><p> One of most impressive aspects for us is the seemingly endless corridor on the theatre level that will be home to 22 world-class theatres and the respective prep rooms and anterooms.  With the mock-ups of how the various rooms will be completed, there is a tangible sense of the positive clinical care experiences that patients and their families will have in the new hospital.  I hope members will see that the vision for this new hospital is being realised and will garner an appreciation of the scale and complexities of the project, as we did.<\/p><p> The paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown opened in July 2019.  From 4 January to 7 May of this year, approximately 2,500 children presented to the centre at Connolly.  Approximately 96% of children are discharged home after their first visit.  A small number are transferred for further investigation and treatment at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght hospitals.  The average amount of time spent by patients in the urgent care centre is 102 minutes.  This is the time it takes from registration to being discharged after being seen and receiving the appropriate treatment from a doctor.  The efficacy of this new facility, despite the challenges of the pandemic, speaks volumes.<\/p><p> The second satellite centre at Tallaght will open before the end of this year.  This opening of the second of the three new campuses will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s health services.<\/p><p> As already stated, the members of the committee also expressed an interest in the timeline and projected costs for the completion of the hospital.  The Department acknowledges the responsibilities and duties of the Committee of Public Accounts and the interest of members in such matters.  As the committee will be aware, a thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Minister for Health in the summer of 2020 to consider the optimal way forward for the completion of the project.  I must advise that the analysis remains ongoing and the Department continues to work closely with the NPHDB towards its completion.  As this analysis relates to the best way forward on a project that is subject to a live contract, it is commercially sensitive and must remain confidential for an extended period.  A definitive update on costs cannot, therefore, be provided and it would be inappropriate and likely detrimental to the project to speculate on these.<\/p><p> Following the completion of this analysis and submission to the Minister for Health, who commissioned it, an update on the position will be provided to the relevant stakeholders, where appropriate, in light of the commercial sensitivities.  I am pleased to say, however, that the development board is providing an update in relation to the timeline.  In addition to this ongoing analysis, the NPHDB and the main contractor are currently working together to identify possible obstacles to the timely completion of the project.  To allow this process to continue unencumbered and without distraction, both parties have agreed to a period of moratorium on claims.  This ongoing moratorium applies to conciliations, adjudications and High Court proceedings.  This will allow both parties to dedicate all their energies towards delivering the project as quickly as possible and is very much welcomed by the Department.<\/p><p> While there is demonstrable progress, there are also challenges associated with the project.  Many of these are not specific to this project, however.  We are still in the midst of a global pandemic.  While work on NCH sites continued through the lockdown earlier this year, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is advising that we should expect a significant wave of Delta variant transmission and we must anticipate the many challenges this pandemic will continue to present.  Indeed, the wider construction industry is challenged by supply chain issues and dramatic price increases.  This was reflected in the recent national economic dialogue where it was noted that the pandemic and Brexit are impacting the economy and productivity and creating bottlenecks in the context of supply.  These challenges face the children&rsquo;s hospital project too, and notwithstanding the commercial sensitivities, makes speculation and definitive forecasting of costs and timelines even more unwise.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, reflecting the positives, we now have paediatric outpatient and urgent care being delivered at Connolly, a site at St. James's that is progressing well, with constructive engagement between the development board and its main contractor, and a new paediatric outpatients&rsquo; facility at Tallaght University Hospital is coming online later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021071300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Prendergast","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626165000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The lead speaker today was to be Deputy Hourigan but she is absent.

We all want to see a national children's hospital built, completed and fully operational as soon as possible.  During our last engagement, we heard about the number of claims that were potentially outstanding.  As other speakers noted, it is extremely regrettable and very worrying that we cannot get a handle on the cost.  We are here on behalf of the public to establish the costs to, and potential exposure of, the public purse in respect of this project.  For the witnesses to come here this morning and say they cannot estimate that cost, or will not do so out of fear of litigation, is worrying from our perspective and will be worrying for the public.  That is not to take away from the importance and strategic nature of the children's hospital.  I look forward to visiting the site again.  I was there before when I was on the HSE's regional health forum prior to being elected to the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to seeing the progress made on site.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  Colleagues have asked about claims.  I refer to the report of this committee in 2019 arising out of its engagement with the witnesses.  Recommendation No. 1 stood out for me.  It notes: &quot;The Committee finds it absolutely unacceptable that nobody can give a reasonably accurate estimate of the expected final costs for the completion and fitting out of the National Children's Hospital.&quot;  Two years later, we are still none the wiser and that is why I am so worried.  It is really concerning that, two years on and given the delays that have occurred, both the witnesses from the board and the Department still cannot estimate the cost.

It is that kind of resource level, or above, which is required to deliver completion of the hospital in December 2023.  We are hoping and becoming more confident that the resources are increasing and going in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Gunning outlined regarding completion in 2023, when we hand over the hospital to Children's Health Ireland, the technical commissioning of all the mechanical and electrical, M&amp;E, systems will be completed in the hospital.  An operational phase then follows, which will be undertaken by Children's Health Ireland.  It includes putting in the equipment - which we will assist them with - cleaning the hospital and familiarisation.  Some 2,500 to 3,000 staff must become familiar with the hospital before it can go live.  Therefore, a serious amount of detailed planning is going on now regarding that exercise.

It has been stated that there is ongoing analysis, presented by Mr. Gunning to Ms Prendergast, where updates are provided based on the challenges coming in, the expected costs and the liability that may go a certain way if those costs come in or not.  There is a stream of documentation between Mr. Gunning and Ms Prendergast in this regard.  If representatives of this committee went to the Department of Health in a private context, and if these documents were to remain private and not to be leaked in some fashion, I wonder if would we get to see this documentation, analysis and accountability throughout.

What I do not want to see in two or three years, though, is that the way in which this process has been handled, possibly because of pressure from this committee - but which I hope Mr. Gunning will resist - resulting in an increase in costs because of a failure to have offered an appropriate defence in this regard.

Is this a reasonable statement to make?  Effectively, the main contractor is the postbox used for any subcontracting increases or variations.  The witnesses explained what a variation or claim is.

He referred to expenditure until 31 December 2019.  He gave us a statement and said by way of example that at the end of December 2019 the contractor had progressed 8.5% of the work by value when it should have been progressed by 22%.  The contractor is responsible.  The delay continued to grow month by month.  The contractor is responsible for some of the delays by virtue of not having sufficient staff on site.  This was prior to the pandemic.  It was part of the contract.  The longer this goes on the more likely it is to accrue construction inflation or add it to the ultimate cost.<\/p> <p>  We also see the site was shut down for seven weeks due to the pandemic but the contractor did not come back for 15 weeks.  I presume the staff were paid a wage subsidy or a pandemic unemployment payment in that time so there was a double cost.

The issue we were concerned with was the timeline because we want to see the hospital built, like everybody else.  As public representatives, we are acutely aware of that right across the political spectrum.  There is obviously the issue of costs as well.  Subsequently, as Mr. Gunning will recall, that engagement was delayed because the report was not ready.  We met on 9 February and we were promised on that date that we would have that in the month of March.  We are now into the second half of July, the second half of 2021.  Although Mr. Gunning cannot speak for the Taoiseach, he will recall that the Taoiseach said that the national children's hospital project would be built by 2020.  However, we learned today that the board and the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform are aware of where the landing point is in terms of price.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we are accountable to the public and to the taxpayer, who will see at the bottom of their wage packets this week deductions for PRSI, PAYE and various other deductions, and it is similar for self-employed people and small businesses across the country, yet we are not able to extract answers.
