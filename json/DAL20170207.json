We saw the human stories behind the figures and they were quite harrowing, particularly in the case of young children with scoliosis.  The programme was a shameful and disgraceful illustration of how those children were failed.  It is not today or yesterday that the issue pertaining to scoliosis patients was raised.  Less than two years ago, we were given assurances that the issue would be resolved but that has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  The people who volunteered to be interviewed showed great courage and were articulate and brave.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude.  We saw Dara from Kilkenny, a very bright child of seven who has scoliosis and who is exhausted on a daily basis because of the lack of action to address his needs.  His mother, Clare, described the physical impact on his breathing, his ability to eat and so on.  We saw how Megan Halvey Ryan found it impossible to attend school because of her scoliosis.  We heard from Colette, John and Betty, all of whom are living in chronic pain because of the lack of access to vital surgery.  It is difficult to comprehend how a person with a brain tumour could be waiting so long for surgery at Beaumont Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund was mothballed by the then Minister for Health, now Senator James Reilly, in 2012.  It was not the solution to everything but while it was in operation, between 2002 and 2011, it dramatically reduced waiting times to six months or three months for the vast majority of people waiting for elective surgery.  For some reason, however, it was mothballed and the figures began to deteriorate rapidly from 2012 onwards, particularly for those waiting beyond 12 months, of whom there were up to 12,000 in 2016.  The figure in 2010 was a fraction of that.  It is easy to track what is going on, as well as the lack of capacity and investment in our system.  Many people resisted the re-establishment of the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the purpose of surgery.  Even in our talks on a confidence and supply agreement, many Fine Gael Ministers did not want it brought back.  To be fair, the current Minister for Health has said that he has &euro;20 million for this year and &euro;55 million for next year.<\/p><p>If anything comes out of the programme, I would ask that the Government make it a certainty, no matter what it takes, that no child with scoliosis has to wait beyond when it is medically important for that child to have the operation and that the curvatures do not get so extreme that it damages the child and causes more clinical complications.  Parents want nothing less for their children.  I cannot understand why private capacity was not sourced for those children or why might and main was not moved to ensure those children's operations got done if they could not be done in Crumlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486476300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin.

I, no more than the Minister, found it difficult to watch this programme, and the stories of Betty and Pat, and Peter and Kate and Patricia, and Elaine and John and Alan, and Kira and Darragh and Megan speak for themselves.  This is 2017 and nobody wants to see a situation like this.<\/p>  <p>  A perception that there was an attempt to cover up figures is not true.  Since the National Treatment Purchase Fund started in 2002, this was always the way, according to best international standards at that time, that these figures were presented.  Patients would get a call to say they would have an operation or a treatment.  Those who have had one treatment but need a second were never counted on this figures.  Irrespective of that, it does nothing for the parents of children who have curvature of the spine, which Deputy Martin mentioned.  This is a serious issue, and Deputy Martin raised it in that spirit.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;2 million that was provided in 2016-2017 specifically for surgery for scoliosis has meant that 133 spinal fusion treatments for scoliosis have been conducted in 2016 for children under the age of 16 years and adolescents between the ages of 16 and 18 years, of which 44 were outsourced to the independent or private sector or the UK under the HSE winter initiative funding.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin himself has been through this.  During the previous Minister for Health's time, the big question about scoliosis was whether we had the theatre capacity.  A sum of &euro;3 million was found and invested in a theatre specifically for this purpose in Crumlin and it is still not open.  The Minister is meeting the chief executive later today, as well as the NTPF and the HSE.  He wants to make it clear that the scoliosis issue is an absolute priority, that he will do more and that he will refer again to the question of the private sector to assist with this.  The opening of a brand new theatre is dependent on the recruitment of adequately trained staff and exceptional efforts are being made to recruit staff who are qualified to do this work.  This is an issue the Minister was upset about.<\/p>  <p>  In respect to the situation that applies generally, &euro;900 million more has gone into the health system this year than last year.  It is now &euro;14.5 billion.  The strategy of health reform is correct in the decision in respect of the National Maternity Hospital, the decision in respect of the national children's hospital, the provision of primary care centres throughout the country and the reduction in the waiting list for routine colonoscopies by 90%.  These are all improvements in the health service which both of themselves and in respect of the staff who deliver them are also to be commended.  However, this is not something that we can stand over.<\/p>  <p>  I found it difficult to watch the programme but it is very necessary that these programmes and patients' stories in 2017 be heard.  I would point out that the function of the Minister for Health, on behalf of Government, is to set the overall policy and strategy and to provide funding within what can be provided, that is, &euro;14.5 billion or &euro;900 million more than last year.  Those charged with delivering the services differ in their opinions.  I heard opinions today about bringing in business people.  I heard opinions today about doing a lot of small things together.<\/p><p>There were also other opinions.  None of them deals with the issue of the child who is waiting for scoliosis treatment.  Today the Minister, in seeking a whole-of-Government response, will examine what it takes to open a theatre which the taxpayer paid &euro;3 million for but which is not open and was designed specifically for dealing with children with scoliosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700004#B00400","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486476600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The way the waiting lists are calculated was changed in many years - 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2014.  The most recent change has been to extend the targets to 18 months, which is extraordinary.  Why did the Government bury the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2011?  We could never get an answer as to why the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, did that.  He took away a capacity that got operations carried out for citizens.  Money was allocated and the individual got the hip, cataract or whatever operation was required.  The Government buried that at a time when there was increasing pressure on the public sector.  The Government was warned time and again about the lists getting worse but the former Ministers, Senator Reilly and Deputy Varadkar, were in denial about that and, in particular, the length of time on waiting lists.  That is a key metric here.  The time was down to six and three months for the vast majority of disciplines and procedures, but now the new target is 18 months and 12 months in some cases.<\/p>  <p>  On the scoliosis situation, the Taoiseach says 44 were outsourced.  All of them should be done, whatever it takes.  The Taoiseach knows about the nursing crisis; he has known about it for three years.  We pointed out in the D&aacute;il that the recruitment of theatre nurses was the greatest crisis in nursing recruitment over the last three years, but nothing has been done to incentivise the recruitment and, critically, the retention of theatre nurses.  That exacerbated the situation that already existed due to closing down the treatment purchase fund from 2011 and the stress and strain on capacity in the public system up to recent times.  There is also the issue of clinical prioritisation.  The growth of C contracts, for example, will put greater strain on public sector capacity to carry out surgery as well.  These issues must be examined.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is urgent that the money not be drip-fed to the treatment purchase fund but fast-tracked and accelerated so there are early significant amounts of money going to the purchase of operations for people such as those we saw last night.  It is unacceptable, as the Minister and everybody say.  Those people should not be waiting any longer in their current chronic pain.  There is a way to deal with it - go out, find the capacity and have the operations carried out for those people.  That is the immediate first step, after which there are wider issues to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1486476600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>That is exactly what the Minister is going to do.

I heard somebody with considerable experience in the medical profession say this morning that the NTPF was a waste of money.  I agree that it has a role to play here.

They are counted now.  That is fair enough but it does not do anything for those who suffer with the difficulties and challenges of scoliosis.  The Minister will be talking to the chief executive of Crumlin hospital, the HSE and the NTPF today and the focus will be on scoliosis, as the Deputy quite correctly requests, in order that no children will be left in their current difficulties and pain.

It appears that over 80,000 patients have been excluded from the official figures.  In addition, 81,000 others are on waiting lists, some in great difficulties.  The total is twice the capacity of Croke Park.  God knows how many more are waiting to see consultants.  The Minister for Health was aware of the scandal.  How could he not have known?  All of us here have made representations on behalf of citizens who are on waiting lists.  We are not talking about a small number of patients.  We are talking about the lives and well-being of more than 80,000 citizens, some of whom, including children, are, as we saw on last night's programme, languishing in tremendous pain.<\/p> <p> This is just another example of a health service that is in a state of perpetual crisis.  I disagree completely with the Taoiseach.  It is not just about misleading the public about waiting lists, it is about the 587 people who are on trolleys today, cancelled surgeries, thousands of hospital beds removed and a two-tier system in which health workers, particularly nurses, are not properly treated, and where patients suffer.  The plight of patients, especially children with scoliosis, and the bravery and anguish of their families, captured so graphically on last night's programme, has further eroded confidence in the Government, our general politics, our political system and our health service.<\/p> <p> There is a complete lack of accountability.  The Minister is not accountable.  The Taoiseach, while he has Fianna F&aacute;il's support, is not accountable.  We should dispense with the pretence that anyone present will get any real answers from the Taoiseach today - not me, not the patients, not their families, not the people working in the health service.  Instead, I propose a single, integrated hospital waiting list management system.  We published this as part of our Better for Health policy.  In December 2015, we presented it to the Taoiseach and the Minister at the time.  It is a plan for a public health service.  While we do not pretend it is an easy fix, we show it can be done.  On the issue of management of waiting lists, we have proposed a new system called \"Comhliosta\".  This would replace the current system and be responsible for generating maximum waiting times based on a single, integrated hospital waiting list system.<\/p> <p> The Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, Deputy O'Reilly, wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on 17 August last requesting a meeting to discuss the proposal.

Last week, I spoke to Deputy Shortall and she asked me for another meeting, which we will hold in the next week or ten days.<\/p>  <p>  The list system is nothing new.  It has been in place since 2002 and the counting of the list has always been the same.  It is nothing new under this or any previous Minister in the 15 years since it was established.  A total of 70% of patients are seen within eight months.  The Deputy's proposal for a single list may have merit.  His spokesperson is on the committee dealing with a ten-year programme for the health system.  It deserves some consideration.  However, what we need is a system that does not change from month to month or year to year.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a counting system since 2002 without changing it.  The other elements, the pre-admittance and people who have had a procedure and who need to be called back for a second one, have never been counted as part of those lists, although they have been published on a monthly basis.<\/p><p>The new orthopaedic unit was completed in 2015.  While it is in use, it has not added to capacity in Crumlin because of rolling closures.  In that sense, two international nurses commenced in Crumlin in January.  Two more are due to commence in March and a further 16 have been offered posts which allows the registration process to commence which can take four months.  The adaptation programme used to be six weeks but has been reduced to two days, which is progress.<\/p> <p> Every opportunity in recruitment and retention is followed through diligently, including working with the HSE and the international recruitment drive to support additional capacity at the hospital.  As of 31 January, there were 193 patients awaiting spinal procedures in Crumlin, of which 143 were for new spinal fusions.  On average there are additional 250 patients every year, 200 additional patients to Crumlin and 50 to Temple Street.

The idea that Governments going back to 2002 were misled about the state of our waiting list is troubling.  I echo the call made by my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, who wanted and is calling for an independent probe into how these lists are compiled and published.  The critical issue is what we do into the future.  The work being done by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare is absolutely critical now.  I urge its members to ensure three things.  First, they should finalise the report as quickly as possible so we can begin implementation.  Second, ensure the recommendations are not focused on short-term fixes but on long-term proposals that will expand capacity and increase outputs.  Third, ensure whatever is recommended is accompanied by a clear implementation plan and detailed costings in order that the recommendations can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, we also learned from media reports over the weekend that the cost of the national children's hospital has spiralled by almost 50%.  As we know, when the planning application for this facility was lodged in 2015 we were told the cost would be &euro;650 million.  Less than two years later, and after much continued controversy about the location of the hospital, we now have a successful bidder but with a significantly higher cost.  That is without taking into account the more than &euro;200 million cost of the fitting out of the hospital.  Some serious questions arise.  Why have costs escalated to such an extent in less than two years?  Where will this extra money come from?<\/p>  <p>  Such additional expenditure comes against a backdrop of other health pressures.  Will the cost of the new Central Mental Hospital in north Dublin, which is a similar project, be on budget?  What about the cost of the new maternity hospital, the planning permission for which we still have not seen lodged yet?

First, the committee should finalise the report at an early time.  I support that.  Second, the recommendations should be focused on the long term as distinct from the short term.  I support that.  The third point the Deputy made was there should be a clear implementation plan to deal with it.  If we can have an all-party agreement from an Oireachtas committee on a ten-year fix on issues that will remove politics from that, then so much the better.  The Minister will be very happy to follow that.  The three recommendations the Deputy made are helpful.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the national children's hospital, which the Deputy was involved with in the beginning, the issue was turned down at the Mater where significant moneys had been spent on excavating the underground car park and the move now to the current site is where I support it should be.  We expect that to be under way very quickly.  The original costs were &euro;450 million, which was estimated when the Deputy was Minister.  That rose to &euro;650 million and we now have speculation that it is somewhere under &euro;1 billion.  It is true to say there are few firms that actually have the competence to build a hospital as complicated and as major as this.  It is also true that during the recession, many construction firms tendered under price and many of them went bust as a consequence.  I am not suggesting that is the reason for the inflation now but there is an element of construction inflation here.  It may well be that in order for the health services to get Government on board they will say they could build for a particular amount.  In any event, once we get on that treadmill, things can rise.

These individuals could possibly be moved to different locations - thereby freeing up beds - and they would still, despite their difficulties, have the same quality of life.  When we consider Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda or the hospital in Galway and see the major operations taking place in terms of construction, clearly, we need a ten-year strategy.

On behalf of my colleagues in this Independent group, Last night's programme was disturbing and distressing and it reflected poorly on the health care system and its inability to respond to serious urgent care needs.  I am delighted with the response from the Taoiseach and that this matter will now be treated as urgent.  However, the message in last night's television programme has been conveyed consistently to the HSE by the consultants and doctors of the patients who featured in it.  I guarantee that every patient had representations made on his or her behalf by probably every Member of this House at some stage and that our recommendations have been ignored.  It takes a television programme to get action.  Where is the response from the HSE to representations made by elected representatives?<\/p><p>The issue I wish to raise with the Taoiseach is the principal health care issue in County Tipperary.  It revolves around the disgraceful situation at South Tipperary General Hospital, which has a grossly inadequate number of acute beds to manage the crisis in acute services.  It routinely has 140% occupancy, whereas the desired occupancy rate for hospitals of its size is approximately 85%.  Therefore, when there is a surge in demand, there is no flexibility in the system, as a result of which we regularly have the highest trolley count in the country.  In South Tipperary General Hospital there are only 150 acute beds per 100,000 of population.  This contrasts with the national average of 230 beds per 100,000.  That speaks for itself.  We have a problem in Clonmel.  It is like a battle zone.  On any day one goes into the hospital there, one will see the walking wounded.  It is completely overcrowded with trolleys literally coming out the door.  There are mixed wards of male and female patients where there is no dignity in the patient care.  There is intolerable pressure on the management and staff of the hospital.  They have been seeking help and looking for support.  The Minister visited the hospital, and we came to the conclusion that an interim solution is required, namely, a modular-type complement of beds, and that South Tipperary General Hospital should be included under the capital programme review.  Many people are criticising the Minister.  My view is he is accessible, approachable, sincere and knowledgeable.  However, he needs the support of Government because this is a national crisis and it needs a collective response from Government to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700009#G01300","speaker":"1240","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486478700,"counter":46,"content":"<p>It is a national situation and requires a whole-of-Government response, which it will get.  In the case of South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel, and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, the Minister has recognised that addressing the capacity issues there must be a priority.  My understanding is that a tender is due in the coming weeks requesting proposals for temporary accommodation in Tipperary.  The HSE has been asked to maximise the use of the Cashel campus and is considering every option to support South Tipperary General Hospital with both community and primary care services, as referred to by the Deputy.  I am also advised that the HSE is working towards providing extra capacity through the fit-out of additional space on the first floor of the hospital to alleviate pressure on the emergency department.  This extra capacity is expected to be available from early May of this year and I understand it could be used to accommodate for space of up to 11 beds.<\/p>  <p>  Also as part of the winter initiative, South Tipperary General Hospital has been identified, as the Deputy is aware, as one of the nine focus sites experiencing the greatest challenge in terms of emergency department pressures.  Consequently, under the initiative, additional measures have been put in place to support the hospital to respond to increases in demand for emergency care over the busy winter period.  These actions include improvement in early discharging and increased access to community intervention teams and to diagnostics.  The winter initiative has allowed for a further additional three home care packages per week at the hospital until the end of February this year.<\/p>  <p>  The winter initiative also recognises that there are specific capacity challenges at South Tipperary General Hospital.  As such, additional options are being considered, including the use of the national framework for alternative accommodation on hospital sites, to which the Deputy referred, to provide additional capacity through a temporary inpatient solution at that site.  The site in Cashel, which includes Our Lady's Hospital, provides mainly primary care services.  There is a small residential facility on the site, together with other services, including day and outreach services.  The residential unit, which includes elderly mental health and intellectual disability beds, is currently fully occupied.  The development of the campus as a centre for non-acute health care services arose from the decision by the former South Eastern Health Board to centralise acute hospital services for the south Tipperary area on one site in Clonmel.  This took place, as the Deputy is aware, in 2007.  The Cashel primary care team is based on the campus.  A range of services are provided on and from the site, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, public health nursing, social work and disability services, as well as home help co-ordination and community mental health nursing.  Among other services facilitated are the south Tipperary community intervention team, a nurse-led service supporting early discharge and the avoidance of hospital admission.  An ambulance station is also located on the campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700010#H00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1486479000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Many people in County Tipperary cannot understand why major surgery is cancelled in Clonmel with early discharges because of lack of beds, not enough step-down or convalescent beds, insufficient home care packages and reductions in home help hours.  People are baffled and bewildered because while this is happening in Clonmel, there is a magnificent building up the road in Cashel, which was refurbished at a cost of &euro;20 million since 2007.  Three of its floors, which could take between 30 and 35 beds, are empty.  They are in excellent condition.  I ask that Cashel be reopened and developed as a primary, community care centre.  It is a premium facility lying idle.  It is shameful and mind-boggling that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is not using the building to its maximum potential at a time when the other problems exist in Clonmel.

I refer in particular to the need to deliver operations and surgeries on a timely basis to young children with scoliosis and people with gynaecological conditions who have been waiting for far too long.  It was revealed in last night's programme that this is happening across the board.  It would be very useful for all Deputies to be able to participate in a fuller and more comprehensive debate.  Many Deputies on all sides of the House have come across different priority cases in their own areas and in hospitals in their own constituencies and geographic regions.  It is important for the D&aacute;il to be flexible and adaptable.  We should have the capacity to respond to issues of genuine and urgent public concern.  In the aftermath of last night's programme, there is no doubt that people want precise answers that set out what will happen in 2017 to ensure the kinds of harrowing experiences that were revealed by patients during the programme are brought to an end.  These issues need to be prioritised and dealt with adequately.  We need to be reassured that the 2017 health service plan gives the Government and the HSE the capacity to do just that.

Such serious action is mostly unwarranted and highlights the need for the pension rights of workers to be resolutely defended and protected.  It is clearly wrong that shareholders can profit from a corporate restructuring while employees are effectively thrown under the bus and have their pension entitlements reduced.  Their rights are being trampled into the ground and this malaise will continue to spread unless arrested by legislation.  There are more than 700 defined benefit pension schemes in the State, covering more than 100,000 working people.  Those workers thought they had made provision for their retirement and many must be seriously alarmed at the nature and extent of the precedent that has been set.  It is, moreover, a dangerous precedent from a public policy perspective because it deters workers from saving for their retirement, something which is being universally encouraged at a political level.  The prospect that workers' lifetime savings might be drastically reduced at some future point militates against that.  The net result will be to force more people into reliance on public provision.<\/p><p>The pensions regulation regime in the UK has diverged from ours in many respects.  In the UK, the law prevents solvent companies from walking away from their obligations to their employees' occupational pension scheme.  At present, accounting standard FRS 102 requires an employer to recognise its liabilities to a pension scheme in its financial statement.  Removing those liabilities from an employer's accounts can have a transformative effect.  However, an employer's obligation to its pension scheme is not governed by statute law in Ireland but by the terms of the pension trust deeds, which the employer itself will have drawn up.  As a result, there is rarely a binding obligation.  In fact, most direct benefit trust deeds allow the employer to wind up the pension scheme and cease contributions, while ignoring any deficit in the funding of the scheme and the resulting inability to pay out the benefits originally promised.<\/p><p>The Bill I am bringing forward seeks to amend the Pensions Act 1990 by adding to employers' obligations in respect of funding issues, including when a defined benefit scheme is being wound up or when the employer has not become insolvent or both.  There is no point in the Government talking about a universal pension provision scheme if people see those who have saved for retirement all their working lives having their pension pots slashed in the unilateral fashion we have recently seen.  There are currently three pensions (amendment) Bills before the House.  I propose that Deputy O'Dea, Brady and I work together with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to formulate a policy that will evoke a positive response.  Deputy O'Dea has already indicated he is willing to pursue such an approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P00700","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P00800","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":160,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P00900","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486482000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P01100","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P01200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486482000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1486482000,"counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700017#P01400"},{"type":"speech","time":1486482000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Bernard J.

The only response to date has been cosmetic.  It has been the addition of the word \"Rural\" to a Minister's title and the announcement that a plan was on the way.  The plan has been published and one would have to wonder why it took so long.  It is a rehash or pulling together of all existing policies.  As Deputy Breathnach informs me, even the schools programme has been in place for quite a number of years.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v quite rightly described it as a reheated dinner.  It is a long list of what is already happening, which the Government has put between two covers and labelled \"Action Plan\".<\/p>  <p>  It is extraordinary that there is not a mention of the blood-stock sector in the plan for rural Ireland.  There are thousands of jobs in the equine sector - trainers, breeders, race courses, from small players up to big players.  There is not a mention of the sector, yet it is sustainable, it is organic and it is in located in rural Ireland.  On fisheries, Deputy Howlin is correct about Brexit.  In the maritime communities of rural Ireland, there is a real crisis coming in the context of Brexit because of so many fish species being caught in British waters.  That is a serious issue.  The most incredible omission is that the plan contains no new commitment to a guaranteed level of access to or quality of public services.  How can the Government realistically claim to have a vision for rural Ireland if it cannot say what level of education, policing, health or other services should be available?

Such a change is particularly important if they are to assist in producing anything like the number of jobs outlined in the ambitions relating to the programme.  The Government also does not appear to have had time to engage in a specific examination of the very real problems that exist in the context of accessing credit, especially relatively small-scale loans for starter and owner-operated businesses in rural towns and villages.  The Government will not create jobs unless it encourages many new small businesses to start up operations.  The Government will not get many large businesses transferring operations to the 300 towns it has identified.  In the context of Brexit, there appears to be no alternative strategy to help small businesses in the areas to which I refer to get up on their feet.

The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister spoke of a seamless and frictionless Border.  They are meaningless terms.  The emerging model of Brexit, as articulated by the Prime Minister, is one that includes a hard Border.  This is as bad as it gets for Ireland.  While the Taoiseach has spoken about a common travel area, the issue is how we mitigate the economic damage which will be caused by the UK's exit from the Single Market and customs union.  This is the central question that faces Ireland.  There has been a pat answer focusing on the common travel.

The report is available on both Departments' websites.  In producing this report, the task force worked with Government Departments; local authorities; the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg; State agencies; the telecoms industry; and other key stakeholders.  The membership of the group included my Department; the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural, and Gaeltacht Affairs; the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Office of Public Works; NewERA; Transport Infrastructure Ireland; Teagasc; Trinity College CTVR; the County and City Management Association; Irish Rural Link; the Irish Countrywomen's Association; businesses based in rural Ireland; the National Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; and an independent planning adviser.  ComReg participated on the task force as an observer in order to provide advice and guidance in its capacity as the independent regulator of the telecommunications market.  The task force met approximately 20 times with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the task force contains 40 actions which will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of the 40 actions as areas where immediate and direct action can be taken by Government Departments and State agencies to ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  The work of the task force will also assist local authorities in preparing for the roll out of the new national broadband plan network once the contract or contracts are in place.  Each of the actions contained in the report and implementation programme has its own timeframe for delivery, which is set out in the report.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the momentum created by the task force, an implementation group is being established to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions.  The implementation group will be led by my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The implementation group will formally report every 90 days to both the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and me, who will in turn jointly brief Cabinet on the progress.

Until we understand where the gaps are, how can we begin to tackle it?  People experience dropped calls and patchy coverage.  People are almost offended by some of the campaigns telling them about the 4G services they can start to enjoy when they cannot even get 3G.  They cannot even get 1G in terms of calls.

That has already happened.  I signed a ministerial order in October to allow ComReg to release the 3.5 GHz spectrum.  It will be auctioned off in the first half of this year and will improve mobile phone coverage.  Part of the problem we have with mobile phone coverage at the moment is that the allocation of licences is based on populations rather than geographic coverage.  It is something I am looking at for the release of the 700 MHz spectrum.  I have already given RTE an allocation for funding in the current year to allow it to begin the process of decommissioning its broadcasting equipment on the 700 MHz spectrum so we will hopefully be one of the first countries in Europe to release that spectrum.

What we are doing in the short term, however, is providing a basic level of service that meets families' needs, whether it is to do with downloading information from the Internet or accessing Netflix or video content, to ensure they have the capacity to do that.  The mobile phone and broadband task force will deal with some of those problems in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700023#V01200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486485600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>There was also the issue of doughnut areas being created around towns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700023#V01300","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1486485600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I advise the Minister and Members that there are 13 minutes allowed for two questions.

The dialogue is much needed, but the sooner the dialogue starts and finishes, the sooner the much-needed action kicks in.  We are well behind on our 2020 targets.  In March of last year, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, produced a report predicting that Ireland's emissions would be between 6% to 11% below the 2005 levels, which indicates that we have actually stepped backwards in this area.  Given the global context, President Trump's various remarks and his immediate steps to row back Mr. Obama's climate change programme, it is even more a priority that Ireland meets its own obligations and takes immediate steps towards that.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the energy mix, the REFIT programme is still stalled, we have not seen action on solar energy and we have an overemphasis on wind energy.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector, and for those areas that will not be covered by commercial operators, the State has committed to intervene and subsidise a network build in order that nobody, no matter how isolated, is left behind.  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies which will roll out a new high-speed broadband network within the State intervention area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland for at least 25 years.

In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high-speed broadband networks.

Last November, the Northern Ireland Minister for the Economy, Simon Hamilton, and I confirmed our joint commitment to the ongoing development of the single electricity market.  The new market arrangements will be in place in 2018 and will yield benefits for electricity market customers in the North and in the South.\u00a0 The UK White Paper on Brexit, which was published last Thursday, noted that the UK is considering all options for its future relationship with the EU with regard to energy.  The UK is particularly keen to avoid disruption to the single electricity market operating across the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The North-South interconnector, which will further support the single electricity market and reduce costs for consumers, has received planning permission in Ireland and is in the planning process in Northern Ireland.  This vital project, which will ensure the security of supply in Northern Ireland, is a further example of the interdependence of our energy systems.  The interconnector\u00a0will enhance competitiveness, bolster security of supply and remove a key barrier\u00a0to the efficient operation of the electricity system across the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that it will lead to initial savings of &euro;20 million per annum, increasing to between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million each year by 2030, shared between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Such cost savings will ensure there are benefits for every home and business in the State and will improve the competitiveness of businesses and the household disposable incomes of citizens.  On this basis, I believe the proposed investment in our electricity infrastructure is a sound one.<\/p>  <p>  The costs of developing the North-South interconnector are not borne by the Irish Exchequer.  The project will be funded in the same way as other electricity and gas grid investments are paid for.  These costs are approved by the regulator and charged by EirGrid, ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland to energy supply companies.  The energy supply companies generally include these costs in customer bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700026#Y01400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486487400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Given that the overall cost of the North-South interconnector is &euro;286 million, I suggest that it would be prudent for the Minister and the Government to put the capital phase of this project on hold until we know what impact Brexit will have on its financing and its viability.  Given that the project is being presented as a key part of the EU electricity grid, what implications will the departure of the UK from the Union have for it?  We are reading various contradictory reports on the possible reintroduction of a hard Border.  It is looking very much like we will have a hard Border.  There are questions surrounding the transfer of goods and services to the UK and through the UK to other European countries.  The potential for associated tariffs is unclear.  I suggest that this, when coupled with the concerns of those who are opposed to the project, means the Minister should put the interconnector on hold at this stage.  I remind the House that &euro;286 million is a phenomenal amount of State funds.  There is huge opposition to this project at present.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to meet representatives of anti-pylon groups in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Meath tomorrow.

The example that has been given in the past is the Aachen to Liege project, where there was undergrounding, but over a much shorter distance and with a lower capacity.

Following a more recent public consultation process in 2012, it was extended and now applies to 26 urban areas nationwide.  The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels, and has had the effect of significantly improving public\u00a0health.\u00a0 Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.<\/p><p>An all-island research study commenced in 2014 into policy options to deal with the problem of airborne pollution from residential fuel combustion, in particular, smoky coal.  The study, undertaken under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, was finalised in December 2015 and subsequently presented to Ministers.\u00a0 The report supports the extension of the ban areas in the Republic and smoke control areas in the North.  While I would like to see a joint approach by authorities to the introduction of an all-island ban on smoky coal, it is, of course, also a matter for authorities in the North to consider.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the timing of decisions in the North and the position taken there, I am committed to extending a ban nationwide in this jurisdiction.  The process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including the European Commission, relevant Government\u00a0Departments and agencies, the residential fuel industry and the general public.\u00a0 Preliminary discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban have already taken place with some of these stakeholders.<\/p><p>My Department is\u00a0currently developing a national clean air strategy which will provide the strategic framework for a set of cross-Government policies and actions to reduce harmful emissions, and consequential health impacts, by improving our air quality.  The strategy will also address a wide range of other national policies that are relevant to air quality, such as transport, energy and agriculture.  Residential home heating is a key source of air pollution, in particular heating generated from solid fuel and smoky coal.  As such, there is a pre-existing commitment to extend the smoky coal ban nationwide by 2018.  This issue will be addressed in the strategy and a consultation process on the strategy will commence shortly.

Anyone who has seen a child gasping for breath knows how serious this issue is.  That is why I want to see it prioritised.  One of the first speeches I gave as Minister was to an Energy Ireland conference.  I made the point that for me the issue of clear air and air quality is crucial.  Deputy Kelly is right to say the coal ban is a crucial part of this.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen to demonstrate my commitment.  The renewable heat incentive scheme discussion document was published some weeks ago.  I have specifically included in the document provisions relating to dealing with issues of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.  The provisions probably would not have been part of the document had the environment division not come to our Department.

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has, however, increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p><p>Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the programme for Government, a commitment to a mobile phone and broadband task force.  In July 2016, I established the task force together with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, which has identified immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigating how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the national broadband plan, NBP, State intervention.  The\u00a0report was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites. <\/p><p>In producing this report, the task force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.<\/p><p>The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  Included in the actions is a commitment made by ComReg to produce a mobile phone coverage map and another action for the regulator to\u00a0carry out a mobile handset sensitivity testing programme.\u00a0\u00a0Both actions will be of great value to consumers, including those in County Kildare.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p>The work of the task force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, I recently signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. <\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p><p>In parallel, the national broadband plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. <\/p><p>The management of radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg, which is\u00a0the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector.  Licences issued by ComReg impose terms and conditions on mobile network operators, including minimum population coverage obligations.  ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests.  However, given ComReg&rsquo;s independence, I have no statutory function in the matter of auditing mobile coverage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700029#BB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1486489200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I am glad to hear that progress has been made.

The Paris Agreement aims to increase the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change through resilience and adaptation and to foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production.  It also aims to make finance flows consistent with the pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.  The Paris Agreement will achieve its goals\u00a0through a range of climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions, NDCs, to be carried out by all parties and\u00a0which will ultimately\u00a0tackle 95% of the world&rsquo;s emissions.  These NDCs are required to be ambitious and to increase in ambition over time in order to achieve the peaking of global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The policy implications of the overall goals of the Paris Agreement will be evaluated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, in a special report to be published next year.  This report will assist the UNFCCC in establishing a system for measuring\u00a0the effectiveness of the\u00a0NDCs submitted\u00a0by\u00a0the parties.  A facilitative dialogue in 2018, informed by the IPCC report,\u00a0will evaluate the overall contribution of the NDCs to the goals of the Paris Agreement.  Beginning in 2023, a five-yearly global stocktake\u00a0of the efforts made by the parties to combat climate change\u00a0will measure their effectiveness and\u00a0drive the ambition of future NDCs.<\/p><p>The reality is that the European Union has been leading the agenda on this, and many other countries have followed suit.

The agreement has now been ratified by 128 parties, including Ireland\u00a0and the EU,\u00a0with significant additional contributions to be made through the stated commitments\u00a0by some\u00a0of the larger parties, namely, China, India and\u00a0the United States, all of whom have also ratified. <br\/><br\/>The Paris Agreement depends on the efforts of all parties to carry out ambitious climate action through their NDCs to achieve its objectives.

I recognise it is an issue of great concern to all parties and none in this House and I continue to believe that improving our health service requires an all-party collective effort.  However, what the programme last night really brought home is the genuine pain and suffering of patients who are waiting far too long for treatment and the impact this has on their lives and on the lives of their families.<\/p>  <p>  I said I was ashamed.  That was not just a word; I meant it.  It is simply wrong.  How can anyone watching that programme not be ashamed?  It is not good enough for me to just be sorry or for me to say we feel ashamed.  What are we going to do about it?  That is why I began unapologetically targeting resources at the specialties with particularly long waiting lists, such as scoliosis and orthopaedics, and at treating those patients waiting the longest - something that did not always happen.<\/p>  <p>  More that 50 additional children and teenagers with scoliosis were treated with funding made available from the winter initiative but I recognise that this has not been enough for children such as Megan, Kira and Darragh.  However, the additional investment achieved progress for those children and young people waiting over 18 months, which is obviously a completely inexcusable length of time for children with this condition to continue to wait.  We also made progress on the overall waiting list of over 18 months.  This was done in 2016 with limited additional funding and in a limited timeframe.  Now, we must do more and I will make sure we do more.<\/p>  <p>  I have just come from a meeting with the CEO of Crumlin children's hospital and the CEO of the Children's Hospital Group and the director of nursing.  I am pleased to inform the House that from April, the new theatre built for the purpose of scoliosis will open.  This will see 194 spinal procedures carried out in Crumlin - significantly more than last year - and will see significant reductions in waiting lists for scoliosis and waiting times for scoliosis patients.  At the end of this month, I will receive from the HSE and the Children's Hospital Group an action plan for scoliosis and I will engage with all parties and none in this House and with advocacy groups in respect of that.  In addition, by June we will have an additional orthopaedic post filled within Crumlin.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, we are responding to what we saw last night, which was unacceptable and needs to be addressed.  Everybody in this House highlighted the many issues in the programme last night that need to be addressed.  The issue of scoliosis in our children and the length of time they are waiting is not acceptable.  That theatre will open in April as a result of the nurse recruitment, an extra orthopaedic post will be in place by June and we will see at least 194 procedures carried out.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, we will have a priority initiative on scoliosis as part of the HSE 2017 waiting list action plan with the aim of every child being treated within the clinical timeframe and if that means outsourcing, that is what we will do as well.  We will eliminate the day-case waiting list of over 18 months by the end of June through the NTPF.  This will see more than 2,000 patients begin to receive their treatment from March.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE action plan, which I will receive at the end of this month, will work in conjunction with the NTPF to utilise capacity within the private sector and maximise capacity and co-ordination within and between hospital groups to treat the patients waiting the longest.  This will be supported by a further &euro;10 million fund for the NTPF.<\/p>  <p>  I expect the action plan combining these measures to be complete by the end of this month and for patients to begin to be treated under it by March.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are to support us moving towards a position where no patient waits for any procedure or any hospital appointment longer than 15 months by the end of October, which still is too long but constitutes progress.<\/p>  <p>  I have also today directed separately that the NTPF will audit the practices in the hospitals highlighted by the individual cases featured in the programme last night.  It is important that lessons are learnt and that the NTPF carries out its audit function to see exactly how each of those cases was dealt with in each of the hospitals.  The NTPF is already undertaking a review of best international practice on waiting list data publication models and I look forward to that work being concluded.<\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear.  When people ask about these waiting lists, this is the waiting list model that has been in place since 2002 under six Ministers for Health and five successive Governments.  It did not alter and it did not change.  Perhaps I say things are \"unacceptable\" too much but I say it because I mean it and we will work to fix this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700032#EE00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491000,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The Deputies have one minute each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700032#EE00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491000,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I welcome the changes the Minister has made.

I will ask the CEO of the children's hospital group to revert to the Deputy directly about Megan's situation, because she would be better placed than me to do so.  I will arrange for that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Murphy O'Mahony about utilising our smaller hospitals.  That is the reason I said earlier that part of the HSE's plan for this year must be about hospital groups.  Where some of our larger, level four hospitals are busy there is no reason that there cannot be more elective procedures carried out in the others.  I expect that to be a feature of the HSE's waiting list action plan, which we will publish at the end of the month.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to issues such as cataract procedures, raised by Deputy O'Dowd, these are part of the more than 2,000 day case procedures that will be carried out with &euro;5 million of funding from the NTPF.  That will start in March.  The Deputy is correct with regard to CUMH.  I spoke about this yesterday on the Claire Byrne programme.  I am concerned about what has happened in CUMH and I have asked the new clinical director of maternity services to report to me on that matter.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to publish an action plan for scoliosis and I will take what Deputy Aylward said on board in that context.  The plan for scoliosis will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups and will dramatically reduce waiting times and waiting lists for scoliosis treatment for children and teenagers in this country.  That is what we all wish to do and I will make sure we do it.  If that involves outsourcing, we will do that also.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the NTPF to audit the practices in each of the hospitals featured in the \"RTE Investigates\" programme.  I have asked it to use its audit function and check exactly how the waiting list procedure was dealt with and if everything was done correctly.  We saw one case where there was a clinical note and the child did not go on a waiting list for a period of eight months.  What happened there is not acceptable.  I look forward to the results of the NTPF audit, which today I directed it to undertake.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony spoke about performance and accountability.  I believe managers must be accountable.  I am the Minister for Health, so I set policy and provide funding.  Then I expect our managers to get on with doing the job.  I have written to the director general to ask how each of the managers across the health service measure up in respect of performance and accountability not just on the financial side, which they are good at measuring, but also with regard to access to services.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Mick Barry about the lists, this is the same way the NTPF has calculated the list since it was set up in 2002 by the then Minister.  There is nothing new here.  Did I know, and did many Members of the House who have been talking about health for a long time know, that when people have their procedures and an appointment for a procedure they do not appear on the waiting list?  I did.  Did I know the size of that?  I did not.  Did I know there was a specific other list?  I did not.  However, I am concerned about the people who do not have appointments for hospitals and who clinically need procedures and about getting that done as quickly as possible.  We are going to make serious inroads and, in response to Deputy Lahart, I did not mean to talk about scoliosis alone.  Across a range of issues we will utilise the NTPF and the capacity in our public hospitals.  We will hold our managers to account.  I hope we will work in a cross-party way to address these serious issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I should point out to Deputies that, on foot of the proposal made by Deputy Martin and others this morning, the Business Committee is proposing to hold a special debate on Thursday morning on these matters which will be more extensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","time":1486491600,"counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  I am speaking on behalf of the Maher family in south Kilkenny.  Their son has autism and for the duration of his life the family has fought for any services they have received for him, be they educational or health.  The family has always had to fight long and hard battles to get anything for him.  I commend them.  I have much respect and admiration for them because they have had a very hard battle.<\/p>  <p>  Their son is now 16 years old and when I say the family is at a crisis point I do not do so lightly.  This is not something I would have considered raising as a Topical Issue if it were not important to do so.  Their son is no longer in school.  When this matter came to a head the family was promised 36 hours of home support by the HSE.  A behavioural therapist visited their home and it was a very positive intervention.  They were very happy with it and felt it would result in many improvements for their son, with a positive knock-on effect on the rest of the family.  However, without explanation or consultation, the hours were cut to ten and the behavioural therapist was not seen again in the home.  The hours were increased to 15 two weeks ago, but that is still less than half the number the family were promised.  The boy is unable to be in school which is detrimental not only from an educational point of view but also from a social point of view and all that is associated with being a teenager in school.  He has already been denied that, so it is rather disgraceful that it is proposed to deny him the home support hours.<\/p>  <p>  I have the family's permission to raise this matter.  The boy's father is a paramedic and he has had to take indefinite leave from his job to help his wife in the home each day.  This will have a negative impact on the family from a financial perspective.  They will end up needing a great deal more support down the line if no intervention is made now.  They need the 36 hours of home support.  It is not a huge amount to seek, given everything else they have gone through.  The hours were agreed and decided, so obviously they were considered necessary.  The family also needs the behavioural therapist to come to the home to carry out his work, as agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to intervene and ensure the family gets this support.  I also ask him to meet with the family to hear directly from them about their experiences.  They represent not only themselves but many families in Carlow-Kilkenny who have had difficulties.  There appears to be a difficulty with services for people with autism in the constituency.  The family will be delighted to travel to Dublin to meet the Minister of State.  I ask him to facilitate that visit and also to intervene and ensure they get the 36 hours of home support and the behavioural therapist visits they badly need for their son.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00700","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1486491600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Funchion for raising the important issue of home support hours for people with disabilities.  I will take this opportunity to outline the current situation with this matter.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to providing services and supports to people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  The commitment is outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.<\/p><p>One way the HSE is working to improving the quality of life for people with disabilities is through the provision of home support hours.  In the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2016, the priority was to provide 2.6 million home support hours to more than 7,300 people with a disability.  The actual number of home support hours provided in 2016 was higher, at 2.9 million hours.  This reflects the responsive nature of the service and takes account of the fluctuation of assessed need over time, as the needs of individual people change.  This is particularly relevant in the Deputy's case.<\/p> <p> This year the Health Service Executive is committed to maximising the provision of health and personal social services, including home support services, within available resources.  In its National Service Plan 2017, the HSE expects to deliver 2.75 million home support hours to more than 7,400 people with a disability.  This is an increase of 150,000 hours more than the last year&rsquo;s target.  The goal is to help as many people as we can.  This is a positive development, which I hope we can build on in years to come.<\/p> <p> The Deputy has raised the matter of an individual case and the home support hours which are being provided to that person.  I am reluctant to speak in any great detail about the specifics of any one case.  This is especially true when it comes to speaking on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  However, given that the Deputy has permission from the family, it is fine by me.  I have made enquiries about the case and I understand the HSE is engaging closely with the family involved.<\/p> <p> Due to the specific nature of the needs of the person in question, it was agreed to introduce home supports on a gradual basis.  Initially, the person is receiving home support at a ratio of two staff working with the person with a disability for ten hours.  Given that there are two staff involved, this equates to 20 hours of home support.  The hope is to increase this gradually to 15 hours, or 30 hours when we take the two staff into account.  The HSE has informed me that the family is aware that the service will be closely monitored and reviewed by relevant professionals, in consultation with the individual, his parents and a family advocate.  I will meet the family and will arrange it through the Deputy any time over the next few weeks.  Parents of autistic children and teenagers have to be a major priority in the delivery of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700033#FF00800","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486492200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and I welcome the fact he will meet the family.

The ten hours of home support is in place for a year.  How gradual is it?  Will they have to wait another year for the hours to increase?  I take exception to the issue of the two staff.  There is possibly a need for two staff and I have no difficulty with it.  However, the family should not be classed as having 20 hours because two staff are there.  The two people are in the home for only ten or 15 hours and it is an unfair calculation on the part of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that the Minister of State is willing to meet the family and maybe we can discuss it further at that stage.  Although I would be reluctant to raise something like this as a Topical Issue matter, it is important and sometimes it is the best way to highlight the situation on behalf of the family and many others in my constituency who suffer as a result of a lack of support services for children, particularly teenagers who have autism.  It can be very difficult when a person reaches the teenage years and is in that in-between stage between child and adult.

They are very important.  I will ensure the Carlow-Kilkenny disability services will continue to engage with the family on an ongoing basis regarding their son.  An inter-agency and interdisciplinary case review was held on 25 January when health professionals recommended that, given the person's situation, it would be appropriate to introduce home community support for him on a phased basis.  The home support services started on 30 January, one week ago.  Further meetings will take place as determined by the individual's needs and will involve relevant inter-agency and professionals, the family and their advocate.  The HSE has also advised the family that it is available to collaborate with the relevant professionals in the Department of Education and Skills.  This is important.<\/p>  <p>  I was directly involved in the negotiations regarding the HSE social care plan and I saw the gap there.  The Deputy probably noticed that in the plan, funding for personal assistant, PA, hours has increased for 2017.  In 2017, we expect to deliver 1.4 million PA hours to 2,357 adults with physical or sensory disabilities.  This is an increase of 100,000 hours compared with 2016.  When dealing with individuals and huge sums of money, we must ensure the service is delivered, in this case, to the particular young person with the intellectual disability.  These are issues I want to hear about from the Deputy and the family at our meeting in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700034#GG00300","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1486492200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's response suggested two staff were working with the person for ten hours.

I wish to share time with Deputy Martin Kenny, who also has a keen interest in the issue.  In 2009, when the Citizens Information Board took over responsibility for the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, offices from the Department of Social Protection, unequivocal commitments were given that MABS would be a separate and distinct service within the Citizens Information Board.  MABS companies were to remain independent with their own voluntary boards of management providing crucial local services.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed restructuring of the local confederation of MABS towards a regional set-up, which would involve six to eight regional offices being established, would be a retrograde step and should be rejected outright.  There are 51 MABS companies with 43 Citizens Information services all operating efficiently and effectively at the coalface, dealing with individuals and families who come with the full spectrum of problems and difficulties, especially mortgage issues.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the excuse put forward for restructuring, namely, the difficulty of managing the 94 boards.  The Citizens Information Board employs 74 staff and regularly uses consultants when required.  I recall that originally only four staff were dealing with MABS when it was established by the Department of Social Welfare , as the Ceann Comhairle will probably recall himself.  I have no doubt the employees and voluntary boards of management are prepared to play a constructive role in addressing any issues the Minister or Citizens Information Board has about their operations.  However, nobody has spoken directly to them in this regard.  Last week, the Minister of State told Deputy Martin Kenny there would be no change in the provision of front-line services.<\/p>  <p>  Why are six to eight regional companies being established and how much will they cost?  It would be interesting to cost them against the voluntary boards whose members come from various voluntary, State and semi-State organisations, bringing great experience.  Some of them are retired and giving their time and effort voluntarily.  What would be the management cost of the new regional companies and who would supervise the allocation process?  The essence of MABS is about direct access at local levels to the communities it serves.  Managing remotely has its own difficulties, hurdles and perspectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700034#GG01000","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1486492200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I appreciate the time he has given to me.  Tomorrow, a group is coming from the MABS organisations throughout the country to do a presentation on this in the audio-visual room.  There are 51 boards, each of which is independent and managed by local people from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Social Protection and various agencies and organisations in the communities where they exist.  They have local knowledge and input and they give their time freely to manage the organisations.  The system works perfectly and without a hitch, and has done since the establishment of the MABS organisations.<\/p>  <p>  The MABS companies have an excellent model for value for money.  The spend 80% of their funds on the salaries of the people who provide the front-line services.  The other 20% goes to rent the offices and pay overheads.<\/p><p>It is absolutely perfect and it works well with no issues.  The situation is that a group in the Citizens Information Board, CIB, wants to regionalise the set-up of existing services, assigning them to eight different regions, and employ a manager to run each agency in each region.  I fear it is intended to privatise the service, like Seetec which provides services through JobPath and which has turned into a total disaster for the public.  We do not want to let this service go down that road.<\/p> <p> The Minister needs to issue a policy directive to the CIB under section 9 of the Citizens Information Act 2007 not to regionalise these boards.  It was done before in 2009 by a previous Minister and it can be done again.  This issue can be resolved.  There is a perfect system working well, providing a good service and which is not broken.  There is no reason to change it.  The only reason seems to be that some people in the Civil Service have decided they would like to have regional organisations and structures, set up boards and get money for running up and down the country for different meetings.  The reality is that the system is working and we do not want it changed.  People are getting an excellent service.  The only problem is that there are not enough advisers from the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, on the ground.  That is what needs to change.  It is not about putting more money into providing managers to run a system which is not broken.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister of State will have a reply from someone in the Civil Service, telling him to read out the answer.  We are not interested in that answer.  We are interested in a bit of common sense being applied.

I hope we have a bit of common sense when we deal with this particular issue.  I am taking this matter for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, who apologises that he cannot be here.<\/p>  <p>  The CIB, which receives Exchequer funding from the Department of Social Protection, is responsible for supporting the provision of information, advice, including money and budgeting advice, and advocacy on a wide range of public and social services.  The CIB delivers on its legislative remit through direct provision of information services and by supporting a network of delivery partners including the local Citizens Information Service, CIS, and MABS.<\/p>  <p>  One of the strategic priorities for the CIB, as articulated in its strategic plan 2015 to 2018, is &ldquo;to revise the structures of CIS and MABS to better serve the citizen by improving management structures and governance, managing of resources and the delivery of high quality services&rdquo;.  The existing network comprises 93 independent local companies, 42 CIS companies and 51 MABS companies, each with its own legal responsibility to provide services within their defined catchment area.  These 93 companies have 93 individual boards, with an average of 9.2 people serving on each board.  This results in a governance structure of more than 800 people for an organisation of approximately 2,800 people.  Maintaining this company structure across each of these local boards consumes valuable administrative resources within the network that could otherwise be directed towards service delivery to citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Small services have similar structures to larger services, with each service performing its own company administration, financial administration and reporting, including reporting to the CIB.  Consolidation of board structures would reduce duplication, deliver administrative efficiencies and free up resources for more front-line activities.  In turn, this would improve the service-user experience, allow for the development of specialist roles as required and achieve an improved consistency in service delivery across the network.  A more streamlined service delivery partner model would also assist CIB in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations, help to promote awareness of the wide range of services and supports available to citizens on behalf of Government.  In so doing, it would further raise the profile of both MABS and the CIS.<\/p>  <p>  The CIB&rsquo;s role in the development, operational management and oversight of the current network of individual companies requires significant administrative effort.  Its many responsibilities include oversight of accounts and operations of all service delivery partner companies in keeping with good accounting practices and the implementation of recommendations from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General; compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies; ensuring optimal access for citizens countrywide to the full range of CIS and MABS services; and the delivery of consistency of services in terms of quality and timeliness on a nationwide basis.<\/p>  <p>  Since the circulation to all CIS and MABS services in September 2014 of a feasibility study commissioned by the board of the CIB on a proposed restructure of these services, there has been extensive and continued consultation with all stakeholders about what the future structural model would look like.  To progress this work further, the board of the CIB recently established a restructuring sub-committee, which comprises several CIB board members, a number of staff of the CIB, and representatives of CIS and MABS services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700035#HH00400","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1486492800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The amendment in Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's name is a proposal to amend the legislation by removing section 28, which criminalises incest on the part of females of or over 17 years of age.  This was discussed briefly on Committee Stage when the matter was before the select committee.  The law in respect of incest is archaic and there was a discrepancy between the penalties imposed upon men and those imposed upon women.  Under the Punishment of Incest Act 1908, the law was created so that incest by a man would be punishable by three to seven years and incest by a woman would be punishable by three to seven years.  There was harmony between the two.  In 1993, section 12 of the Criminal Justice Act amended the law in respect of incest by men and it altered the penalty to one of 20 years.  Subsequently in 1995, the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act amended the penalty again to increase it from 20 years to life imprisonment.  As matters stand, incest committed by a man is punishable by life imprisonment but incest committed by a woman is punishable by a term of three to seven years.<\/p>  <p>  This issue came to some public prominence in January 2009 when we had a prosecution and conviction for incest which is highly unusual.  In January 2009, a mother of six was convicted in Roscommon Circuit Court on ten counts of incest.  At the time, the judge noted the only penalty available to the court to impose was a sentence of between three and seven years.  That gave rise to some concern that there should be harmony between the two offences.  However, my view is that a penalty of life imprisonment for incest in the context of the offences that already exist on our Statute Book is excessive.  For example, if that case against the mother in Roscommon arose in the aftermath of the legislation before us being enacted, sections 16 and 17, which deal with sexual acts with children under the ages of 15 and 17, respectively, would apply.  If the mother in question was prosecuted in respect of having sex with her son and if the son was under 17 years, she would now face the possibility of a term of imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.  The imposition of a penalty of life imprisonment is anachronistic.  The thing that slightly concerns me - I will wait to hear Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's view on it - is if we agree to the amendment, the law will remain as it is at present so that men can be prosecuted and imprisoned for life in respect of incest and women can be prosecuted and imprisoned for three to seven years.  My view is it would have been better if the penalty for both was three to seven years.  It is a bit of a dilemma and I am interested to hear from the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700036#JJ01600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1486493400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.  I thought there were four matters on the Topical Issue debate but there were only three.<\/p><p>The amendment was discussed on Committee Stage.  I pulled out the transcript of the Committee Stage debate this afternoon to make sure I was correct in what I am about to say.  We raised the issue with the T&aacute;naiste on Committee Stage .  She gave a commitment that she would look at it for Report Stage.  She said, &quot;It is an interesting issue and I will examine it.  The gender anomaly was upheld as recently as 2012.&quot;  The T&aacute;naiste went on to explain the case in question, which we discussed on Committee Stage.  My amendment would remove what the T&aacute;naiste is proposing, which is that:<\/p><blockquote>Any female person of or above the age of 17 years who with consent permits her grandfather, father, brother or son to have carnal knowledge of her (knowing him to be her grandfather, father, brother or son, as the case may be) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life or a lesser term of imprisonment.<\/blockquote><p>I understand very well that this is the current situation if one is male.  If this amendment was accepted and if the T&aacute;naiste's proposal in section 28 was withdrawn, incest would still be illegal on the Statute Book for any female person of or above 17 years.  The penalty, as has been outlined by Deputy O'Callaghan, would revert to the penalty within the 1908 legislation, which is a term of three to seven years.  This is not a case of removing the section and it suddenly becoming legal.  It would still be illegal to have carnal knowledge of one's grandfather, father, brother or son.  The question we are being asked by the Minister is to increase the sentence from three to seven years to life imprisonment.<\/p><p>Given that I raised the matter on Committee Stage and that we are now on Report Stage and the T&aacute;naiste has not brought forward her own amendment, I do not believe she has demonstrated that it would be in the public interest to increase the sentence of three to seven years to life imprisonment.  The Minister has not articulated her position.  The only rationale she gave on Committee Stage was when she said, &quot;The male offence would still be life.  That is my point.  We were equating the offences.&quot;  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste is trying to equate the offences but she still has not demonstrated what public good would be served by increasing the sentence from three to seven years to life imprisonment.  We are not talking about sex which is not consensual.  Let us be very clear on that.  There is adequate legislation to deal with somebody who is having sex without consent.  We are talking about a female over the age of 17 years who, with consent, would still be committing an illegal act and would still be liable for a prison term of three to seven years as opposed to life imprisonment.  Unless the Minister can demonstrate the rationale behind the increased prison sentence, it is my intention to press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700036#JJ01700","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1486493400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I will go into some detail on this in order to be helpful.  Sections 27 and 28 simply update and restate the existing provisions in the Punishment of Incest Act 1908 in so far as the offence of incest is committed by a male or female.  We are trying to update the language and provisions of a very old Act.  It will bring the penalty for incest by a female into line with that of a male.  The Deputy's amendment would have the effect of bringing the female to seven and leaving the male at life.  That inequality would remain if we went along with the Deputy's amendment.<\/p><p> I take the point Deputy O'Callaghan made and I will come back to that in terms of the overall approach to incest in this part of the Bill.  There are two further distinctions between the offences, and the first relates to consent.  The Deputy is suggesting that the entire section should be removed but where the offence is committed by a male, it is not a defence that the female consented.  The offence by a female does not provide for a similar provision.  The reason for this is because the nature of the offence of incest by a female is different from that committed by a male.  The offence by a female is committed where she permits a specified male relative to have carnal knowledge of her and relying on defence of consent on the part of the male would not arise.  Incest by a male is committed where he has carnal knowledge of a specified female relative.  In this case, it must be specified that consent by the female is not a defence.  In fact, the female party to the act, by consenting, is liable for the offence under section 28.  If there is no consent on either party, the offence is not one of incest but it is one of rape under the Criminal Law (Rape)(Amendment) Act.<\/p> <p> I have already referred to, and the Deputy has quoted from it, the Supreme Court judgment regarding this where the Supreme Court upheld the gender distinctions, so I will not go into the detail of that again.  The Chief Justice noted previous case law which held that the Oireachtas is entitled, on public policy grounds, to protect underage females from the risk of pregnancy - this was the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court saying this - as the female carries a greater burden from the act - emotionally, physically and psychologically - should she become pregnant.  Similar policy grounds were also the basis for the distinction in section 2 of the 1908 Act.  That is in regard to consent.<\/p> <p> If we do what Deputy O'Brien is suggesting in his amendment, namely, delete this section, the consequence of that is that we would retain the existing provisions under the Act along with the difference in penalties.  We would not go back to equating the penalties but to having a life sentence for a male and a seven-year sentence for a female.<\/p> <p> I want to make some general points about this issue.  The amendments I am tabling close an anomaly relating to the penalty which applies depending on whether the offender is a male or a female.  What I am suggesting changes that.  The fact is the offence of incest specifically recognises the harms and exploitation associated with intrafamilial sexual abuse and, as we know, it can extend beyond the victims to the entire family unit, and there have been some prosecutions.  The purpose of the provision is to equalise the penalties between offences committed by males and those committed by females, as well as taking the opportunity to modernise some of the language in the Act.<\/p> <p> However, I would make the general point that in so far as Deputies have expressed concerns about the framing of offences, as Deputies O'Callaghan and O'Brien have done, this is an area of law that we could look at again if Deputies consider that appropriate.  I have looked at it.  It is a very complex legal area and I do not believe that I can do it in this Bill.  It would be an issue for other sexual offences legislation.  If we were to reform this, that would require a good deal of consultation and discussion on the change in the penalties that I am advised we would have to consider.  This was done in England, for example, and the whole issue of incest was completely taken out of sexual offences legislation and a separate Bill was brought forward.  Quite an amount of work would need to be done on that.   What I am doing here is equating penalties, dealing with the consent issues and describing why they are slightly different for males and females, and I am not going further than that.<\/p> <p> I would ask Deputies to consider not pressing amendment on the basis that this is a very complex area and that I cannot go further than this in the legislation and in the amendments I am proposing, which are doing what I have set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700036#JJ01800","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486494000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I agree completely that this is a very complex area.  That is why I would have preferred if the Minister did not insert this particular section and she had dealt with the issue in its entirety, as she suggested, in new legislation  While I do not doubt her sincerity in dealing with incest in separate legislation, the reality is if this legislation passes, we will be increasing the penalty.  I want to be clear on this.  The section she proposes to insert - she referred to the Supreme Court case which dealt with females under the age of 17 -  deals with females over the age of 17.  To refer to the Supreme Court case to justify the insertion of this section is wrong at a minimum and misleading at best.  We are referring to women over the age of 17.  The Minister still has not demonstrated to me the public good that would be served by increasing a sentence ranging from a maximum sentence of seven years to a minimum of three years to a life sentence.  The only rationale she has given is that she wants to equate the sentences that would apply to the male and the female.  The Minster should do what she suggested she wanted to do and that is deal with this issue in a separate legislation.  Let us make no mistake about this, we are not saying that if this section is removed, there will be no penalty.  The penalty of a sentence of three to seven years will still be in place.  I will be pressing my amendment because I do not believe the Minister has demonstrated what public good would be served by increasing that sentence to life in prison.

In terms of changing the law, the law is being changed if Deputy O'Brien's amendment is defeated.  It is being changed if section 28 is introduced.  The law at present provides that there is life imprisonment for a male who is convicted of incest but the sentence is three to seven years for a woman who is convicted of incest.  That is the law today and it will continue to be law if the Deputy's amendment is passed.<\/p>  <p>  I note what the Minister said.  It is a complicated area and I have given it some thought.  On first principles, I believe imposing a potential sentence of life imprisonment on a female for incest is excessive.  Back in Edwardian times the penalty was three to seven years and the penalty for men was three to seven years.  There was a reason in 2009 why the woman in Roscommon was prosecuted for incest.  It was because there were other areas of the law that were not available.  As I mentioned at the outset, sections 16 and 17 are broader sections that cover offences which were not covered previously.  If a mother was inappropriately having sex with her son who was under 17 years of age, that is something that can be prosecuted and penalised for up to 15 years at present.

The T&aacute;naiste's amendment will allow the prosecution in sexual offences cases to apply for the disclosure of counselling records even if the defence has not looked for them.  We have tabled amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 28 to provide that if what the T&aacute;naiste is proposing goes ahead, there should be a review of the operation of this measure \"not later than two years after the commencement of this section\".  Such a review would look at the impact this aspect of the legislation is having on people involved in rape or sexual assault cases.  This would enable us to ensure it is operating as intended and is not leading to the disclosure of counselling records becoming the norm, which could deter victims from coming forward.

The T&aacute;naiste said during the Seanad debate on this Bill that she expects to be in a position to address some of those concerns.  One concern relates to the use of counselling records to question the competence of a potential witness.  I suggest that our amendment No. 51, which proposes that \"records relating to therapy or counselling shall form no part, partial or otherwise, of any assessment regarding a relevant record likely to be relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a complainant or witness to testify\", would remove any doubt in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700040#NN00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1486495500,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 28, which has been proposed by the T&aacute;naiste.  It is important to recall what the function of a prosecutor in a criminal trial is.  The function of a prosecutor here, unlike in America, should not be to adamantly pursue a guilty conviction.  His or her function should be to put the evidence fairly before the jury so that it can determine whether the accused is innocent or guilty.  My reading of the amendment that has been proposed by the T&aacute;naiste is that it provides that if a prosecutor in a case becomes aware of a record that should be disclosed to the other side in the interests of justice, then it should be disclosed.  The alternative is for there to be no statutory requirement for such disclosure.  If the prosecution is aware of any evidence that might be to the benefit of the accused in the trial if it were available to the accused, it is important for the prosecution to make that evidence available to the other side and the matter should then be put before the jury.<\/p>  <p>  I have given a great deal of consideration to amendment No. 50 in the name of Deputy Shortall.  I am slightly concerned about her proposal that the individual has to be \"offered a reasonable opportunity to obtain independent legal advice on the issue of disclosure rights\".  On balance, I think such a provision would probably confuse the matter.  It would ensure that when an individual is asked to sign something with regard to disclosure, a mechanism will have to be put in place to give him or her an opportunity to avail of and receive independent legal advice.  If it is the case that he or she signs something under duress, or he or she is pressurised into doing so, he or she should be able to say afterwards that this happened.  Ultimately, it is important in any criminal prosecution for all relevant evidence put forward by the complainant relating to the guilt or innocence of the accused to be before the trial.  The consequences of these matters for both parties - the complainant and the accused - can be extremely severe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700040#NN00400","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1486495500,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I remind Deputy Coppinger that the prosecution receives these records as part of the criminal investigation when it is making a decision on whether prosecution should take place.  The concern that an accused may seek to delay a trial by not making an application is something that needs to be considered as well.<\/p>  <p>  One of the concerns I have with Deputy Shortall's amendment No. 50 relates to its potential to undermine the independent rights of individuals in these cases to make their own decisions on whether records relating to them can be disclosed.  The application process is being introduced to ensure relevant records only are disclosed.  Obviously, this should not undermine each individual's right to allow disclosure outside that process or to give rise to legal argument on whether a statutory requirement has been met.  I recognise that amendment No. 50 merely seeks to afford the opportunity to obtain advice.  I am also aware that there is concern that victims might be pressurised to waive consent.  A number of processes and procedures will need to be put in place prior to the commencement of section 38.  In that context, I have asked for consideration to be given to the information that is to be provided to victims with respect to the disclosure of counselling records.  This information should include information on the right of a victim to seek legal advice prior to waiving his or her consent.  I can build that into the processes and procedures prior to the commencement of section 38.<\/p>  <p>  The second aspect of amendment No. 50 concerns child complainants.  I fully agree that child complainants warrant the fullest protection possible.  I am satisfied that the provisions contained in subsection (8) of the Bill offer adequate protection without the need for the further provision that has been proposed.  As Deputy O'Callaghan has suggested, this further provision would bring some unnecessary confusion to the process.  I remind the House that I introduced an amendment to subsection (8) on Committee Stage to require the court to take account of \"the likelihood that disclosing, or requiring the disclosure of, the record will cause harm to the complainant\".  This will apply to all complainants and not just to children, although the fact that a complainant is a child will be of relevance in determining the likelihood of harm.<\/p>  <p>  Amendment No. 51, in the name of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, seeks to remove counselling records from any assessment under the new provision.  The purpose of section 38 is to regulate the disclosure of counselling records and to determine their relevance to the issue at trial.  This process will be undertaken by a judge as part of a pre-trial process.  The entire removal of counselling records from the process could give rise to a real risk of an unfair trial and could be open to legal and constitutional challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I think I have made the main points I wanted to make on the various amendments.  I hope the Deputies can support the amendments in my name.  They will ensure that if an individual fails to make an application for disclosure, and the prosecutor is aware that there are records which are likely to be relevant to the issue at trial, the prosecutor may make an application for a pre-trial hearing.  The disclosure or otherwise of the records, and the conditions attached to any such disclosure, will remain a matter for the court.  I think I have dealt with Deputy Shortall's point by suggesting a way of approaching it.<\/p>  <p>  I am also proposing amendment No. 42, which proposes to replace the word \"trial\" with the words \"criminal proceedings for which the record has been disclosed\" in subsection 12(b) of this section.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure any records used at a trial would also be available for any additional criminal proceedings for which the record was initially disclosed; for instance, if the case were to be appealed.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to make a technical point with regard to Deputy Coppinger's amendment.  She has not included the subsequent changes that are needed.  This would have an impact on the ability to commence the section.  It is a technical point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700040#NN00500","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"speech","time":1486495500,"counter":494,"content":"<p>Could the Minister outline the safeguards that are being provided to ensure any counselling or therapy records that are released will not be used to question the competence of a complainant or a witness who is testifying?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700040#NN00600","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1486496100,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I would like to have further information, although we have limited time to discuss this.

Yet, it is proposed that the prosecution could potentially use what is said to a therapist or a counsellor against that person.  I can foresee many situations where that might happen.  If the victim knew the person they were accusing of rape or sexual assault, and said things about that person, I could foresee many things that might then be used against the victim.

The reality of what has been happening in recent times is that there has been no regulation in this regard.  Records have been requested but, because it is unregulated, there has been huge concern in regard to private records.  People go to a counsellor assuming that the discussion is private and that they will not end up in the situation the Deputy described.  People working in the area have put a lot of work into this issue and want to see greater regulation and protection for victims, which is why we are coming forward with this legislation in order to regulate the issue.  It is a protection for those appearing in court and a protection around counselling records.  It is a regulation of this area which is not there at present and which most of the groups working with victims have been quite concerned about.

Under Part 5 of the Sex Offenders Act, a court can impose on a sex offender a sentence involving post-release supervision.  This is imposed at the time an offender is being sentenced but will only take effect from the release of the offender from whatever prison sentence has been imposed.  The supervision on release is undertaken by the Probation Service and the offender is required to comply with such conditions as are specified to secure the supervision.  Failure to comply with a condition is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum term of 12 months.<\/p><p>We have recently been made aware that, in some very few cases, an order is made without conditions being imposed.  This means that if an offender does not co-operate with a supervising probation officer, no offence is committed and, in effect, a breach of the order cannot be sought.  This amendment will amend the relevant section to provide that a sentence involving post-release supervision shall automatically include a condition requiring the sex offender to attend all appointments with his or her probation officer, whose supervision he or she is under, and to comply with the lawful instructions of that officer.<\/p><p>Effectively, all orders for post-release supervision will contain automatic and inhering conditions as set out in paragraph (a) of this amendment.  Paragraph (b) allows a probation officer to apply to the court one month prior to the release of the offender to amend any of the conditions imposed in regard to post-release supervision.  This recognises that, depending on the length of the prison sentence, the type of conditions which are necessary to secure the post-release supervision of the offender may have changed from the time of the original sentence, as the offender's needs may have changed over that time.  I hope I have the support of the House in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700041#OO05600","speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486496700,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486496700,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486496700,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 57 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1486496700,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 58:<\/p><blockquote>In page 38, after line 12, to insert the following:<div>&ldquo;PART 9<br \/><br \/>CHANGING SEXIST AND ANTI-LGBTQ ATTITUDES<\/div><b>56.<\/b>The Minister for Justice and Equality is to report on measures that could be taken by the State to combat sexist and anti-LGBTQ attitudes in society, including: a review of sex education in schools and colleges; classes on consent, respect for women and LGBTQ people and the damaging effects and exploitative nature of the sex industry; and public awareness campaigns on consent and to discourage men from buying sex, within six months of the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>The purpose of the amendment is to tie in with the stated intention of the Minister in introducing criminalisation of the purchase of sex.  We are proposing that measures need to be taken in society to combat sexist and anti-LGBTQ attitudes in society.  We are proposing a review of sex education in schools and colleges.  Classes on consent are in place at third level but not at second level.  There needs to be a discussion about respect for women and LGBTQ people and the damaging effects and exploitative nature of the sex industry.  We also need to discourage men from buying sex.  In effect, we need a public awareness campaign on consent, and for this to take place within six months of the Act being enacted.<\/p><p>After the Minister put forward her proposal, we proposed other amendments relating to exit strategies.  We need to put in place real supports, including financial, language, addiction and welfare supports as well as many other supports, to allow people who want to get out of sex work to do so.  If such supports are not in place, the number of vulnerable people involved in prostitution will not reduce.  That is the reality.<\/p><p>The amendment also targets demand.  There is demand for the purchase of sex.  It is created by our culture and society.  Basically, our society prioritises the needs of men &ndash; 99% of the purchasers of sex are male &ndash; and subordinates the needs and desires of women.  LGBTQ people are involved in prostitution as well.  Of course vulnerable men are involved in sex work too, as are transgender people.<\/p><p>The amendment would seem like common sense if the Minister were serious about bringing about a change in behaviour in society in respect of sex work and prostitution.  If that is the goal, these measures are essential.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 59 also calls for a full review of the rights of victims.

It is not within the remit of my Department to deal with issues around the purchase of sex.  Of course the new offence of criminalising the purchase of sexual services is dealt with.  We have already introduced an amendment to deal with a review.<\/p>  <p>  Several of the matters raised by Deputy Coppinger are relevant to ongoing campaigns.  Awareness raising campaigns are run by my Department and the National Office for the Prevention of Sexual, Domestic and Gender-based Violence.  Recently, that office launched a national awareness-raising campaign, \"What would you do?\", as part of the second national strategy.  Considerable funding going into the campaign and it is under ongoing review.  The campaigns are aimed at raising awareness of domestic and sexual violence.  Moreover, they are aimed at bringing about change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes.  The idea is to activate people with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.  Such education and awareness will be underpinned by legislative provisions, including the provisions of this Bill as well as the Domestic Violence Bill, which I published last week.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Coppinger's amendment is outside the scope of the Bill.  Clearly, that is not to show any ambivalence in standing up to domestic, sexual or gender-based violence.  I cannot accept the amendment.  It is not within my remit to report on a review of sex education in schools and colleges.  That is one function the amendment seeks to provide for.  Clearly, everyone in the House is agreed with the basic proposition that we should take every possible action to deal with sexual and gender-based violence and to withstand all forms of it.

This is the only legislation being brought in to change the laws on prostitution and sex work.  However, without this amendment, no attempt is being made to influence change in society.  Simply bringing in a law is not going to solve the problem.  If this is to be a serious attempt to protect people and to decrease the numbers involved in sex work, the Minister should undertake the measures I have proposed.

The purpose of the Bill is to provide part of the legislative framework necessary for the introduction of what is termed &ldquo;the third payment option&rdquo; in relation to road traffic offences in respect of which a fixed charge notice may be served under Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.<\/p><p>This short Bill of just four sections is centred around the amendment, for technical reasons, of section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986.  It will allow for the integrated printing of a summons and the related fixed charge notice for serving on persons alleged to have committed certain road traffic offences.  This will ensure those who commit such offences can be brought fully to account.  The Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016 is a joint initiative between myself as Minister for Justice and Equality, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross.  The intention would be that, when enacted, its reforming measures will be made operative by the Minister, Deputy Ross through his commencement of section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, that being the section which provides the legislative basis to bring these reforms into practical effect.  This Courts (No. 2) Bill will, therefore, provide the legal nuts and bolts for the desired reform while section 44 of the Road Traffic Act of 2010 will trigger that reform into operation.  The designated date for this to happen, including with the relevant IT supports in place, is 1 June 2017.<\/p><p>The reform objective behind the very technical provisions of today&rsquo;s Bill is to resolve an unintended legal loophole which has emerged over time.  At present, under the Road Traffic Act 2002, a person who does not pay a fixed charge notice within the 56<\/p><p>days set down in law is served with a summons.  At that point the person has no further payment option and must attend court.  However, persons regularly appear in court and state that they did not receive the original fixed charge notice and many such cases are dismissed by the courts.  In these cases neither the fixed charge nor the penalty points end up being applied.  This can even happen in cases where a person might not be taking issue with the alleged infringement concerned.  As the law stands at the moment, a fixed charge notice offence affords two payment options before a summons is issued requiring a person to attend court.  These are a first period of 28 days, during which the person may pay the fixed amount, followed by a second consecutive period of 28 days, during which the person may pay the fixed amount plus 50%.<\/p><p>The key objective proposed under the Courts (No. 2) Bill is to provide the essential technical and administrative measures to enable the introduction of a third payment option, which is a payment of the fixed amount plus 100%, while upholding any penalty points concerned without necessitating further court or Garda time.  This third option will be made available up to seven days before the date on which an offender will otherwise have been summoned to appear before the court.  If a person takes up this option, proceedings in respect of the alleged offence will be discontinued and the person need not attend court.<\/p><p>This is a short but highly technical Bill of four sections whose rationale is set out in greater technical detail for Members&rsquo; attention in the relevant explanatory and financial memorandum.<\/p><p>Section 1 provides for the definition of the term &ldquo;Act of 1986&rdquo; as meaning the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986, that being the Act which sets out in primary law the provisions relating to the issue of District Court summonses in relation to offences.<\/p><p>Section 2 amends section 1 of the 1986 Act in the form of six amendments as set out in paragraphs (a) to (f).  Paragraph (a) adds a new section 1(2A) to the Act of 1986 which provides that the issue of a summons under section 1(2) of the Act of 1986 shall be deemed to have been effected by the transmission by the appropriate court office by electronic means of all the information necessary to create the summons document in an automatic manner, that is, using electronic means.  A lot of work has been done by the courts office to ensure we can do this.  Paragraph (b) adds a new section in a way which is intended to allow for the automated processing of batches of summonses or applications for summonses.  Paragraph (c) provides for the insertion of a clause into section 1 of the Act to include a reference to a summons the issue of which is deemed to have been effected under the new section 1(2A) to which I referred.<\/p><p> Paragraph (d) provides for the insertion of paragraph (aa) into section 1(9) of the 1986 Act, which is intended to ensure that a summons which was created in an automatic manner shall be presumed to have been created on the basis of the information transmitted by the appropriate court office unless the contrary is shown.  Paragraph (e) provides for the insertion of a clause into section 1(10) of the 1986 Act to include a reference to a summons the issue of which is deemed to have been effected under the new section 1(2A) to which I referred.  Paragraph (f) provides for two defined terms to be inserted into section 1(14) of the 1986 Act, namely, a revised definition of the term \"document\" and the substitution of the definition of the term \"true copy\" in respect of a summons.<\/p> <p> Section 3 makes specific provision in regard to a summons to be issued in circumstances where the person who is alleged to have committed a specified road traffic offence is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present, section 88(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 and the relevant District Court rules include a provision that a summons against a person who is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be signed by a judge.  Subsection (1) seeks to set aside this restriction for the purposes of this Bill.  I intend to bring forward an amendment to section 3 on Committee Stage.  This will centre on the retention of the provisions of the current section 3(1)(a) while putting aside those of section 3(1)(b) in its reference to section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  Upon further reflection, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the need has emerged for a more detailed review to be undertaken of the issues arising out of the current section 3(1)(b) than the narrow context of this Bill would allow.  It is therefore considered that the relevant matters should be given further dedicated consideration in their own right, including in further consultation with the key stakeholders.  It is considered that the retention of section 3(1)(b) as it stands, while well intentioned, could slow down the overall passage of the Bill while these further issues are considered.  While still under preparation by my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the proposed amendment to section 3 will, of course, be explained in more detail to Members on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Section 4 deals with the Short Title of the Bill, its collective citation and construction with the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, and its commencement by means of ministerial order.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House as a means of closing an undesirable loophole in the application of the Road Traffic Acts.  It has the potential, if brought to enactment, to increase payment on foot of the relevant fixed-charge notices, ensure the application of the relevant penalty points and reduce the number of cases that would otherwise go on to take up valuable court and Garda time.  It will provide further means of ensuring those who commit such offences on our roads are brought fully to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700044#RR00600","speaker":"1214","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486498200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>Like the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 we debated earlier and the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016 we will debate tomorrow, the Bill before us this evening, the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016, is welcome.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on the productivity of her Department in bringing legislation before the House.  The same cannot be said for some of her Government colleagues.  Perhaps she will tell them they need to be become as industrious as she is when it comes to the advancement of legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports this Bill, the purpose of which is to provide essential technical and administrative measures to allow for the introduction of what the T&aacute;naiste referred to as the third payment option.  This will address the situation whereby persons responsible for road traffic offences do not incur fines or penalty points for technical reasons.  Some of those reasons were highlighted recently in the media, with reports of cases being prosecuted in different districts around the country where individuals were able to come to court and say they never got a summons.  Consequently, the judge is left with little option other than to strike out the proceedings on a technicality of the law as it exists at present.  What this shows is the importance of enforcement of our laws.  We spend a great deal of time in this House preparing detailed and complicated legislation which sets out procedures for when people's behaviour will be criminalised.  We also set out the mechanisms for the imposition of the penalties for such criminal behaviour, but sometimes that aspect of the legislation receives only a small amount of focus.  However, if there is no effective enforcement of laws, those laws are undermined.  Unfortunately, that has happened in respect of certain road traffic offences.  People were able, as I indicated, to state in court that a summons was not received and, as such, they should not be held criminally liable.  We must ensure the enforcement mechanisms we introduce are effective and that legislation facilitates easy enforcement by the prosecution services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We must make sure that where the law is broken, there are consequences for those responsible.  If that message is not established in our legal system, there will be no deterrent for individuals who wish to break the law.  In fact, the person who admits liability and pays a penalty will be seen as gullible and foolish.  That should not be the case.  We must ensure the law applies across the board.  If a crime is committed and a penalty deserves to be incurred, it is essential that the appropriate penalty is available to the courts.<\/p>  <p>  As the T&aacute;naiste indicated, the situation that pertains under the Road Traffic Act 2002 is unsatisfactory in that a person who does not pay a fixed-charge notice within the 56 days set down is served with a summons.  Individuals may pay within the first 28 days or within the second 28 days.  If payment is not made with 56 days, however, a summons is issued, after which there is no further payment option and the accused must attend court.  Unfortunately, as I outlined, people have appeared in court claiming they did not receive the original fixed-charge notice and have had their cases dismissed.  It is difficult to ascertain precisely how many cases have been dismissed on these grounds, but it seems to be in the region of 7,500 annually.  We must ensure, too, that people who are prosecuted for minor summary offences have the opportunity to pay.  Sometimes when people know their court date is approaching, they want to pay the charge.  However, under the existing legislation, if the 56-day period has lapsed, they must present in court.  Under the new procedure set out in the Bill before us this evening, such people will have to pay a 100% penalty after the 56-day period.  Notwithstanding the imposition of that penalty, it offers a benefit to accused persons in that it will remove the necessity of having the case determined in a court of law.  Individuals should be given that opportunity and, for this reason, Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700045#SS00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1486498200,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill, which will positively impact on the efficiency of court administration and free up Garda resources for much-needed operational deployment.  Under the current system, those alleged to have committed a relevant road traffic offence are issued with a fixed-charge notice, which is issued and printed on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and payment of which is made through An Post.  The notice stipulates that the fine must be paid within 28 days and the relevant penalty points accepted.  Where the fine is not paid within the initial 28-day period, the fixed-charge notice provides for a further 28 days within which payment of the original fine plus 50% may be made.  Failure to pay a fine within the 56-day period will result in the automatic issuing of a summons requiring the alleged offender to appear in court.  This process does not require a member of the Garda to apply for the summons to be issued; the summons is triggered by the non-payment of the fixed-charge fine.  As Deputy O'Callaghan outlined, many individuals who have come before the courts have claimed they did not receive the original fixed-charge notice and have thereby avoided penalty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700045#SS00300","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486498200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1486498800,"counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700046#TT00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1486498800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I wish to share my time with Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Mary Butler.<\/p>  <p>  Even before 2008, defined benefit pension schemes were under pressure.  Of course, this trend was accentuated by the crash in 2008 which is why, I suspect, that in 2008 the pensions regulator suspended the minimum funding requirement.  This was widely seen at the time as an attempt to allow defined benefit pension schemes which were struggling some breathing space to weather the storm.  We had an election in 2011.  I recall this was an issue during the campaign and the then Opposition parties, particularly the main Opposition party, promised to do something about it.  They did not do anything for two years, but they did something about it in 2013 which, unfortunately, made matters much worse.  They restored the minimum funding standard in 2013 and added a 15% reserve on top of it.  In addition, they prized &euro;2.5 billion out of pension funds by way of a levy.  Even pension funds that were in difficulty had to pay this levy.  One had a situation where some sponsoring company and its employees had built up a pension fund, it was not sufficient to discharge the accrued liabilities to the employees and nevertheless they had to pay a levy to the Government to further deplete their resources.<\/p>  <p>  There are two aspects of the pensions system I want to deal with and there is a third dealt with in the Bill to which my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will refer.  The first one is a glaring anomaly whereby under Irish law a company which is perfectly solvent can allow its defined benefit pension scheme to run into deficit and then decide unilaterally to close it down to the detriment of those who have been paying into it, in many cases, for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years.  I have come across persons who were coming quite near retirement when their scheme was arbitrarily shut down.  The supreme irony of the situation as I am sure Deputy Mary Butler will tell the House, is that if both the company and the pension scheme become insolvent, because the Government was forced to give a correct interpretation to the EU insolvency directive in the Waterford Glass case, the pensioners will get practically all they are due.  In other words, the more solvent the company the less chance the pensioners have of getting anything in the event of a closedown.<\/p>  <p>  Somebody who has paid into a pension scheme for many years in the legitimate expectation that he or she would get a certain return is entitled to have a situation where, if the company sponsoring the scheme into which he or she has been paying is financially viable and in a position to pay up the accrued liabilities of the pension scheme, the company should be compelled to do so before it winds the scheme up.  This has been the situation in the United Kingdom for more than 20 years.  Section 75 of the UK Pensions Act 1995 provides that in such a situation where the company is solvent, the company is in a position to pay and it decides to close down the defined benefit pension scheme, the company is not allowed to close the scheme down until such time as it has made up the deficit.<\/p>  <p>  Admittedly, there have been a number of studies of, debates, reports, etc., on this legislation and, of course, it has been found to be imperfect.  The main argument is that in some cases a company cannot afford to keep paying the pension and if the company is forced to pay down the crystalised debt, it could drive the company into insolvency to the detriment of everybody.  I accept that as a legitimate argument and that is why what I propose is a much more nuanced scheme.  I am proposing that the Pensions Authority must give its permission to wind up the scheme, if the company is solvent.  If the company can establish to the satisfaction of the Pensions Authority that the payment of the full amount would drive the company into insolvency, the Pensions Authority should be able, at its discretion, to allow the company to pay a lesser amount - the minimum would be 50%, but I am not inflexible on the amount.  I am aware that the Labour Party and Sinn F&eacute;in have produced their own proposals on this matter.  I have not studied them in any detail but I intend to do so.  I do not have a monopoly of wisdom.  I am sure the Bill has many defects and if there is anything better in the legislation from the Opposition parties, I would be quite happy to take any amendments they submit on board.<\/p>  <p>  The second problem is that the liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes are grossly inflated because they are based on a fiction.  When calculating liabilities, a company needs to have enough funding in the pension scheme to discharge its liabilities if the company is wound up tomorrow.  This is totally artificial.  It takes no account of the long-term nature of pension provision.  It takes no account of the fact that companies do their accounts on a going-concern basis rather than on the presumption of wide-up.  A proper ongoing funding model will have to be devised to deal with this situation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, when it comes to valuing the liabilities, there is an equally artificial situation.  Not only is the company supposed to have enough to discharge liabilities if the company is wound up tomorrow but it must discharge them by purchasing annuities which are underpinned by the most expensive possible type of bonds, triple A rated bonds.  The yield on triple A rated bonds has been very low during the period of the financial crisis - it has recovered somewhat now which makes the situation a little easier.  It is high time that this was looked at and an alternative model devised.  This is why I provide that the Pensions Authority should look at this situation and report back to the Joint Committee on Social Protection or to both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months with its suggestions in this regard.  If somebody is entitled to a pension of a certain amount on retirement if that is what he or she has signed up for and if the person must buy an annuity, a bond which is yielding a 1% return will cost twice as much as a bond which is yielding 2%.  Therefore, the standard has been set inordinately high.  It is time that some method of recalculating these liabilities was looked at.  If that could be done - I firmly believe it can and there are moves to do so in other countries - not only would it make defined benefit pension schemes, many of which are on the brink, viable but it might even turn the tide of closures.<\/p>  <p>  Those are my two requests.  There is another aspect to the Bill which my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will deal with, but those are the two requests I have for the Minister.  I ask the Minister to allow legislation which requires the Pensions Authority to come back to us with a feasible system based on reality of calculating liabilities in order that schemes will not be artificially in deficit, and to correct a blatant injustice, which has wiped out many honourable persons who contributed to pension schemes for years and were left with nothing and which has been allowed to fester for far too long.  Those are not unreasonable requests.  As I said, the Bill is not perfect and I am prepared to take amendments or any suggestions from the Opposition, the Government or whoever on board, but those two issues have to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  Owing to the difficulties with the British legislation, I have deliberately nuanced my party's approach in order that it will not be as onerous on the sponsoring employer.  In other words, I am trying to find a balance between fairness and justice for the contributors and the danger that some might be tempted to wind up existing defined benefit pension schemes in view of the imminence of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700046#TT00300","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"speech","time":1486498800,"counter":575,"content":"<p>It gives me great pleasure to speak to this Bill and I commend Deputy O'Dea for bringing it forward.  As he said, he has covered certain items in it.<\/p><p>In the six minutes I have available before passing over to my colleague, Deputy Mary Butler, I wish to raise a number of items.  <\/p> <p> The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is very familiar with pensions because he had a hand in the undermining of pensions benefits in the past five years, particularly in his role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport when he brought forward the State Airport (Shannon Group) Act 2014 and section 32 therein.  It was the first time a Government legislated for the reduction of benefits in a private pension scheme, the Irish airlines superannuation scheme or the airport pension scheme.  It was probably the most unjust of the injustices done to any pension scheme member, and I speak as somebody who worked in the pensions sector for 15 years before entering politics.  Long standing service members lost 60% of their pension entitlement.  Retired members, people of 70 or 80 years of age, lost six weeks of their annuity.  It was all for selling the stake in Aer Lingus.  The company was shown a roadmap of how to increase its pension deficit with a view to getting permission to wind down the scheme.  That roadmap has been followed up to now.  During debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, was in the Minister's position as the Minister was not present for that part of the debate.  One of the striking features of that Bill was the fact that it contained nothing about private sector pensions in real terms.<\/p> <p> I am trying to think of any other Government - many mistakes were made on pensions - that did more to undermine pension provision than the previous one.  Deputy Willie O'Dea has mentioned the more than &euro;2.6 billion taken out of people's savings by way of the private pensions levy.  Then there was the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013 which was brought forward by the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton.  A number of the items included in the Bill before us now were amendments that were voted down on Committee Stage of previous social welfare Bills.  That is the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves.<\/p> <p> One element of this first occurred in the pensions section of the State airports Bill, whereby scheme members could be moved unilaterally out of their pension scheme without their permission.  It does not matter what their benefits were, how long they stayed in the scheme or how much they have paid into it.  They can be moved unilaterally out of their scheme into an inferior arrangement, that is, from a defined benefit arrangement to an inferior defined contributions scheme.  That happened to 15,000 people in the airport pension scheme.  They were moved out without their permission.  Section 2 of the Bill brought forward by Deputy Willie O'Dea provides for the right to appeal.  If the majority of members disagree with such action, they would have the right to appeal.  We would like to go a step further and provide that they could stop it, but at least an appeal would go to an independent authority.  This is something that was proposed in an amendment on Committee Stage of a previous social welfare Bill and it was opposed by the previous Government.<\/p> <p> In other countries that are more concerned about the preservation of people's pension rights, a company would not be allowed to wind down a scheme unless it met a 90% funding standard, that is, unless there was money available to pay out to the scheme members.  Deputy Willie O'Dea has covered a number of items, particularly regarding how we calculate the liability.  The current situation is nuts and it must change.  It is absolutely crazy.  My main concern about what has happened in the last four or five years is that we have given every employer with a defined benefit pension scheme a roadmap to wind down the scheme.  This Bill would redress that somewhat and go some way towards fixing it.  I would like us to go further and to go further with redress for people, such as the 15,000 workers in the airport who, for the sake of &euro;342 million which the previous Government trousered through the sale of the State's stake in Aer Lingus, lost up to 60% of their pension benefit.  We saw what happened to the workers at Waterford Crystal who had to go to the European court.  My colleague will cover that issue.<\/p> <p> This Bill is a start in undoing some of the actions taken over the last five years.  I favour going further.  My colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, has produced other legislation to provide for banning any private pension levy in future.  It would prevent any future Government imposing such a levy.  We intend to continue on this course of trying to protect workers' and pension scheme members' rights and trying to ensure that unscrupulous employers will not remove people's pension rights and the benefits they have built up over time.  I ask the Minister to consider what the situation would be in the public service, and I include all the Members in that, if somebody approaching retirement and expecting a retirement pension of &euro;40,000 is told within weeks of his or her retirement that the pension will be &euro;12,000 per annum or less, even nothing in some instances.<\/p> <p> Double insolvencies happen.  Companies become insolvent and wind up.  In those instances the scheme has to be wound down.  The Bill provides that if a company is solvent it would have to get permission to wind down the scheme.  I would like us to go further on this matter, but this is a start.  I hope the Bill passes Second Stage and that colleagues across the House can work on strengthening this legislation, providing more protection and rowing back on some of the retrograde steps that were taken over the past five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700046#TT00400","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486499400,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill.  It provides that workers in defined benefit schemes would be protected from their employers attempting to wind up the scheme.  Tonight's debate is the first opportunity for the D&aacute;il to discuss this important topic and find a legislative solution to the problem that is clearly evident.  In the past few years we have seen many large, financially solvent companies wind up their pension schemes and jeopardise the future pension payments of their workers.<\/p>  <p>  The first case that comes to mind is that of Waterford Crystal.  The Waterford Crystal workers were in that position and had to take their case to the European Court of Justice to win their appeal.  Simply put, the workers alleged their defined benefit pension entitlements were not protected in 2009 when their former employer, Waterford Crystal, became insolvent and their defined benefit pension scheme wound up with a deficit of &euro;110 million.  Those circumstances culminated in the workers only receiving between 18% and 28% of their expected entitlements, which the European Court of Justice found did not amount to protection by the State.  It is bad enough to lose one's job and be obliged to apply for jobseeker's benefit, but it adds insult to injury to find out that one's pension benefits are lost after paying into the fund for years - for up to 40 years for some Waterford Crystal workers.<\/p>  <p>  The fight of the Waterford Crystal workers was long and protracted, with the European Court of Justice rejecting the Government's argument that the State contributory pension should be taken into account in assessing how much of the lost pensions should be made up following the insolvency of Waterford Crystal and its pensions fund in 2009.  There is still a group of approximately 80 former employees of Waterford Crystal, who were employed on a contract rather than a full-time basis, who have yet to be paid under the terms of the pensions settlement negotiated between the Government and the Unite trade union.  I appeal to the Minister to bring this process to finality and to end the pensions saga that has been ongoing since 2009 for the workers of Waterford Crystal.<\/p>  <p>  I support the Bill.  Employees need greater pension protection.  I have spoken about the Waterford Crystal workers, but there are many more.  The case of Independent News &amp;amp; Media was extensively reported before Christmas 2016.  Independent News &amp;amp; Media pensioners lost approximately 40% of their entitlements in a 2013 restructuring plan under which the company undertook to put &euro;5.6 million into the scheme for ten years.  The recent decision taken by the management of Independent News &amp;amp; Media to wind up the defined benefit scheme means the members will suffer a further reduction of approximately 30% in their remaining pensions benefits.  It has been reported, although it is denied by Independent News &amp;amp; Media, that the wind up of the defined benefit scheme will strengthen the balance sheet of Independent News &amp;amp; Media and will result in ongoing savings every year.  However, the full extent of the savings will largely depend on any deal reached between Independent News &amp;amp; Media and the trustees of the defined benefit scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There is a weakness in Irish legislation that allows healthy sponsors to walk away from defined benefit pension plans by shutting them down without creating a high priority debt on the employer.  It is hard to credit that a financially solvent company would be allowed wind up its pension scheme, thereby reducing the pension entitlements of its workers.  Companies have an obligation to treat their employees fairly and equitably.  The Bill aims to address the issue of solvent companies closing defined benefit pension schemes to the detriment of the scheme's workers.<\/p><p>Profitable firms should not be allowed to walk away from a defined benefit scheme.  I reiterate my support for the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700047#UU00200","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486500000,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to engage in a discussion of the problems in defined benefit pension schemes.  The provisions contained in the Bill propose major changes to the Pensions Act.  The changes would have significant and far-reaching consequences for the defined benefit pension sector in Ireland.  I will speak first about the general issues affecting defined benefit schemes and then about the impact of the provisions contained in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Defined benefit schemes have been facing substantial challenges in the past two decades due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates and regulatory requirements.  The cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the investment returns earned by pension schemes.  In addition, accountancy standards which make pension liabilities very apparent on a company&rsquo;s balance sheet contribute to the pressures under which defined benefit schemes are operating.  During the financial crisis the decline of such schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole sector was at risk.  At that stage, a series of legislative amendments were brought forward to alleviate the position.  This followed much consideration of the matters dealt with in the Bill such as balancing returns between members, debt on the employer and pension protection funds.<\/p>  <p>  There has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to contribute to a pension scheme, nor to accept liability for deficits therein.  The Bill would turn a voluntary contribution into a mandatory obligation and would, therefore, be a major change.  Most defined benefit pension schemes were established under a trust deed.  The employer generally undertook to be bound by the rules of the scheme and meet certain liabilities and duties on a voluntary basis.  In spite of the difficulties, many employers have made great efforts to support and deliver on the pension promise made to scheme members.<\/p>  <p>  Many scheme trustees are working hard to ensure the ongoing viability of their schemes.  This process is best managed through discussion and negotiation between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement on the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability.  These steps generally include a mix of measures such as increased employer or member contributions, longer working through changes to the retirement age and amended benefits.  This is the best approach to dealing with scheme difficulties.  Further steps can and should be taken regarding the funding standard.<\/p>  <p>  Following discussions between my officials, the Pensions Authority, the Society of Actuaries in Ireland and the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the Pensions Authority will shortly bring forward proposals to allow some additional flexibility for defined benefit schemes and to tackle some of the difficulties in the current operation of the standard.  I intend to consult employer and union representatives on these proposals before making any change, as is appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the provisions contained in the Bill.  As Members are aware, it can be very difficult to put forward legislative proposals which would have the desired effects without negative implications.  The area of pensions is very technical and the issues are complex and not often amenable to easy solutions.  While it may seem that a few simple changes could provide scheme members the level of security they desire, the unintended consequences can be far-reaching and destructive.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 proposes that an appeals mechanism be put in place to provide for appeals by scheme members where a pension scheme is being wound up, frozen or restructured by scheme trustees where any category of members is being treated in an inequitable manner.  There are already regulatory safeguards in place for members where a wind-up or restructuring of a scheme is proposed.  Trustees must have undertaken a comprehensive review of the scheme with a view to its long-term stability and sustainability.  This includes asking the employer for contributions sufficient to ensure scheme funding.  Trustees must notify, in writing, the scheme members and anyone receiving benefits under the scheme, as well as the trade union or representative group representing scheme members, before they make an application to the Pensions Authority to reduce benefits.  The scheme members or their representatives are entitled to make written submissions to the Pensions Authority which will consider submissions prior to making a direction.  Groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members have a right to appeal a direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill seeks to introduce an appeals mechanism, it does not indicate what should happen if the appeal was successful.  It aims to prevent schemes from being wound up where any category of members is being treated inequitably.  However, this inequity is not defined in any way in the Bill.  For example, if it is intended that all members should have equal priority, it would be a significant change from the current position where pensioners have higher protection than other categories.  While I am sure this is not the intention of the proposers of the Bill, it could be a consequence.  Rather than being protected as they are, the Bill could expose existing pensioners who are already retired to having their pensions cut substantially in the event of a wind up.<\/p>  <p>  Having discussed it with the Attorney General, we are also concerned about its constitutionality under Article 43, given that it would be retrospective and could constitute an expropriation of vested rights and an infringement of property rights.  The Bill makes no provision for making up any shortfall or paying contributions.  In some cases, stopping a scheme from winding up or the \"extend and pretend\" solution would result in a far worse outcome for some scheme members, particularly younger ones who were still paying in.  The scheme would have to continue with solvency potentially deteriorating and older members using up the assets before younger members retired.  This would surely be the most inequitable of all outcomes, effectively turning a defined benefit scheme into a pyramid scheme, ironically as a result of proposals which have the avowed aim of ensuring equity.<\/p>  <p>  Under legislation passed in 2013, changes were made to extend the categories of benefits which could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits to include a portion of pensioner benefits.  These changes were designed to spread the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members and beneficiaries.  The change also recognised that all beneficiaries of a scheme, members and pensioners, needed to share the risks when a scheme was underfunded.<\/p>  <p>  In section 3 the Bill further seeks to prevent the wind-up of a defined benefit pension scheme when the value of the assets of the scheme is less than the amount of the liabilities until the deficit is eliminated.  This would effectively put a debt on the sponsoring employer equal to the amount of the deficit.  However, if the Pensions Authority was satisfied that the payment of the entire debt at the time of proposed wind-up would present a serious risk to the solvency of the employer, the Bill might allow for the payment of up to 50% of the deficit and-or allow the company up to five years to pay the deficit.<\/p>  <p>  I understand there is a real desire to protect scheme members and prevent employers who will not pay, as opposed to those who cannot pay, from walking away from the schemes they sponsor.  Serious consideration was given in the past to imposing a statutory obligation on employers to secure a minimum level of funding before a scheme could be wound up.  The advantage of placing a minimum obligation on the employer would be to protect the benefits of current and former schemes members.  It might also prevent employers from walking away from defined benefit schemes and encourage employers to ensure schemes were well funded and managed.  However, there are also strong arguments against the introduction of an employer obligation.  Imposing an employer guarantee might be seen as unfair on employers who have voluntarily set up defined benefit pension schemes.  The previously voluntary commitments under these schemes would become mandatory, whereas there would be no corresponding obligation on employers who had set up defined contribution schemes or had not set up any pension scheme at all.  To avoid debt, there is a danger that some employers with underfunded schemes might wind up the scheme in advance of completion of the legislative process which, by its nature, will take some time to put in place.  Anti-avoidance structures would be necessary to prevent employers from restructuring to avoid their obligations.  Account would have to be taken of single-employer schemes, multi-group schemes and those with multinational parent companies and how solvency could be measured in these complex circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The extra funding burden would accelerate the closure of defined benefit schemes in the private sector.  The result of such a change, designed to protect the position of defined benefit pension members, would have the opposite effect.  Few, if any, defined pension schemes would remain.  While putting a debt on the employer might improve scheme security, in most cases, the pension liabilities and investment risk assumed would be too big for a company to support.  It could jeopardise the viability of the businesses and jobs of those employed, given the employers' lack of capacity to absorb this extra liability.  In such cases, people could lose their jobs long before becoming eligible for a pension.  It could encourage imprudent investment behaviour by trustees, given that losses would have to be made good by the employer.<\/p>  <p>  There is no readily available, reliably accurate and consistent measure of solvency and the Bill does not propose one.  Furthermore, there is no connection between a company being solvent or having net revenues at a point in time and its ability to fund a scheme in the long term.  Rather than implementing a solution by putting a debt on the employer with unknown consequences, the approach taken to date is to nurse and support schemes to gradually move to more appropriate funding levels in the short, medium and longer term using regulation and the benefits of a strengthening economy.<\/p><p>Changes such as the pensions insolvency payments scheme, sovereign annuities, the introduction of a risk reserve and allowing for the restructuring of scheme benefits are all measures which have been introduced with this approach in mind.  These have all been put in place in recent years.<\/p> <p> Section 4 proposes that the Pensions Authority prepares a report on the feasibility of changing the minimum funding standard for defined benefit pension schemes and establishing a pension protection scheme within six months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700048#VV00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486500600,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt the Minister as he has exceeded his ten minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700049#WW00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1486500600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Perhaps the remainder of my speech might be included in the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700049#WW00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1486500600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>No, that only applies to parliamentary replies.

Fianna F&aacute;il could have done this a long time ago when it had a majority Government and the power to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Back in 2012, the OECD clearly identified the allowing of healthy sponsors to walk away from defined benefit pension plans and shutting them down as a weakness in Irish legislation.  After all these years, a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill introduced last week spurred others to introduce a Bill on this matter only two days later, although late in the day.  Last week, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill to directly address the issue of healthy companies making a conscious decision to wind down defined benefit schemes and walk away from their pension obligations.  Our Bill would ensure no company with positive net revenues, or which has a parent company with positive net revenues, would be allowed to close a defined benefit scheme unless this scheme has reached a minimum 90% funding standard.  This would have prevented what happened last November in Independent News &amp;amp; Media, INM.  This would have sent a clear message to profitable companies that they will not be allowed to simply decide to renege on and walk away from their obligations to their employees.<\/p>  <p>  The Government could have supported and introduced our Bill without, in the words of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, &ldquo;threatening a company&rsquo;s financial stability&rdquo; or &ldquo;rendering some employers insolvent&rdquo;.  We are only talking about companies which have positive net revenues.  Only last month, the Minister made it clear he had no plans to bring forward legislation regarding defined benefit schemes but that issues in respect of these schemes are continually scrutinised by his Department, especially given the current environment.  If this is true, what conclusion did his Department&rsquo;s scrutiny come to on the back of the pension debacle at INM last November?  That company announced its intention to shut down its defined benefit pension scheme, inflicting cumulative benefit cuts of up to 70% on some of its current and former employees.  What was the Minister&rsquo;s response?  He stated, &ldquo;My Department scrutinises issues around defined benefit schemes&rdquo;.  It simply does nothing.  That is not good enough for workers in this State.  The Government&rsquo;s inaction sends a message to companies right across this State that they are free to consciously wind down defined benefit schemes and walk away from their pension obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Certain companies have taken, and will take, advantage of this weakness in legislation which allows them to walk away.  In recent days, I have been contacted by several employees from a profitable and well-known company which has announced to its employees its intention to move from a defined benefit to a defined contribution pension scheme.  This will remove the defined benefit pension scheme and replace it.  Despite all these issues, the Government chooses to sit on its hands.<\/p>  <p>  This Fianna F&aacute;il Bill is not without its faults.  If we were to see a similar situation to Clerys in 2012, would this Bill protect that pension scheme?  In that case, 460 employees of Clerys were left without their pensions.  For the 500 active defined benefit schemes remaining and for the 120,000 members within them, steps must be taken.  We have a responsibility, as legislators, to take action for the protection of pension schemes and for the protection of workers.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill.  However, we will be looking at ways to improve it to ensure maximum protection for workers.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, sent a call to all Opposition parties to work together on this matter.  I am willing to sit down with Deputies Willie O&rsquo;Dea and Willie Penrose and others to ensure heads of a Bill are prepared to strengthen this area to guarantee the pensions of all workers are protected across the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700049#WW00900","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1486500600,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Any action to protect the tens of thousands of workers in a defined benefit pension scheme is welcome.

Instead, it must provide absolute legal safeguards.<\/p>  <p>  The procedures in the Bill aim to create an appeal system and a level of oversight for the closing of schemes.  It also provides added functions to the Pensions Authority.  We must guarantee these powers are effective.  Any improvement on the present appalling situation where there is no legal protection or oversight needs to be examined.  Without this protection, these pensions are solely the responsibility of scheme members and are the subject of many disadvantages, such as conflicts of interest.

That is good because it shows there is an energy in the House and a commitment to at least addressing the issue.  A range of different views have been expressed about how it should be addressed but obviously it is something that we need to commit to and resolve very quickly.  The recent action by Independent News &amp;amp; Media to close its defined benefit scheme, cutting staff payments by over 70% even though the parent company is in profit, shows the type of ruthless behaviour we are dealing with here.  The company will be paying out its dividends to shareholders.  Two of the most famous of them, who are tax exiles - one of whom has brought a case against this House - will receive their payment but they can take money from pensioners, which is unacceptable.  <br\/><br\/>I also raise the issue of Waterford Crystal pensions.  I am glad Teachta Mary Butler raised it.  She has done some good work on this issue.  She said we have to make sure that we do not add insult to injury, so I have to, in all conscience, remind the Deputy that it was Fianna F&aacute;il that made sure those workers were dragged kicking and screaming through the courts.  It was the former Fianna F&aacute;il Government that did not face up to its responsibilities and led to Waterford Crystal workers having to take a court case to the European Court of Justice.  The State and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party fought them every single step of the way.  I am glad the previous Government dealt with it and I am glad the European Court of Justice ruling found in their favour.  I am also glad the vast majority of those workers were protected and have received their payments.<br\/><br\/>As Teachta Mary Butler did, I will raise the issue with the Minister of those people on contracts of service who had a number of unpensioned years.  As the Minister knows, a number of meetings took place, one of which I attended with the Minister and union representatives.  There was a willingness on the Minister's part to examine the issue but those workers have heard absolutely nothing yet.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, was on local radio in December and said the issue was sorted and the workers would get their entitlements within a matter of weeks.  Weeks have passed and they have heard nothing.  I am asking the Minister if he can clarify this once and for all.  Is he looking at this and will he resolve it?  Will he make sure those workers get the entitlements they feel they deserve?  The Minister is concerned about issues of precedence and I know he is looking at legal issues, but workers deserve to know whether this will happen.  They have been kept in the dark and dragged along for months and years on this issue and they simply want a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer.  Will the Minister deal with this issue?

I applaud Deputy Willie O'Dea for introducing the Bill.  Pension law is a complex area that needs significant and detailed examination, scrutiny and discussion in order to achieve change.  Like everyone else in the House, I do not have a particular monopoly on wisdom or expertise in this area.  My Bill was launched on 24 January but I do not care whose is first, second or third.  We all have a collective responsibility to ensure that whatever is for the betterment of over 100,000 workers is achieved.<\/p>  <p>  I have done some studying in this area in the past few months.  It is an area that has not exercised me legally up to now.  I looked at the Pensions Act 1990 and the subsequent amendments.  I thought there were three main deficiencies in it.  There was a lack of legal obligation on solvent employers to fund pension schemes.  All the Bills are trying to achieve that, although they may be coming at it from different perspectives.  This racket in which solvent employers can legally walk away from their liability to defined benefit pension schemes, as required under their employment contracts with current or former employees, by simply deciding to wind up a scheme at any time is incredible.  They can just walk away.  The incongruity of the whole thing, to which Deputy Willie O'Dea referred, must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  In recent times, we have had a number of very solvent employers with insolvent schemes as determined under the jackass method of determining liabilities and funding standards.  In the current climate, with President Trump running crazy over there, inflation about to come back, money being made on bonds and issues like that, the &euro;20 million or &euro;50 million will be eaten away shortly and we will get back to normality, even in the current crazy system of evaluation.  Leaving that aside, we have that scheme and unfortunately employees in that situation are left in the lurch.  Perhaps they were entitled to &euro;250 but they will end up with &euro;60 or &euro;70 if they are lucky.<\/p>  <p>  We also have the situation referred to by my colleagues involving Waterford Crystal.  In that situation, there was a double insolvency because the company and the scheme were insolvent.  The State, under the insolvency provisions, had to step in, directed by the court and under European law.  Those people had some sort of a scheme.  The Deputies are arguing about it being accelerated and finalised, and hopefully that will happen for all the workers, but at least the scheme is there.  One should compare that to somebody in the other position.  The incongruity of that situation deserves our legislative focus even if nothing else happened.  We should forget about some of those smart schemes and the clever accountants and lawyers they have to make sure they are always ahead of the posse.  That is the point.  It is all possible because most defined benefit pension trustees and rules allow the employer to wind up pension schemes and cease contributions while just ignoring any deficit in the fund of the scheme and its inability to pay the profits.  It is most unsatisfactory that an employer's liability - the funded deficit on wind up - is determined solely by the trustee rather than by legislation.<\/p><p>The problem is that the trustees do not even get an opportunity to review the trust deed.  The employer is always in the dominant position and that is the problem.  The inequity is highlighted by the fact that nearly 100% of employees were not aware that the defined benefit clause of an employment contract was not a binding liability or an obligation on the employer.  I have met a number of experienced employers and as far as I could gather they made no effort to bring the relevant clause of the trust deed to the attention of their employees.  The fact companies reported the pension deficit as a liability in their audit and public financial statements only added to the employees' belief that their pensions were guaranteed.<\/p> <p> My Bill on this area would make a useful contribution to this debate.  The accounting standards require an employer to recognise its liabilities to a pension scheme in its financial statement, in other words, in its balance sheet.  The way I constructed a proposal in this area was that the liabilities would be removed from the balance sheet, which would have a transformative effect on a company's accounts.  Some of the accounts we considered lately - for example, the media companies that have been highlighted and companies in other industries - appeared to be much healthier than what was shown.  I was shocked to hear of another company affected in this area in the south.  I was getting rid of this facility in my Bill.  In other words, if we take the step of removing those liabilities from the balance sheet, that would immediately become a crystallising event.  It is a different way of doing it from what is proposed in Deputy Willie O'Dea's Bill but it is same principle.  The debt then would be recoverable as a contract debt.  It would be removed from the balance sheet but if one was being a smart aleck in doing that, it would not make any difference in that an event has been triggered and it has crystallised the debt.  It is important that is achieved in whatever way it can be achieved.  The very fact it is not governed by statute law is something we have to be mindful of.  There are a number of areas there on which we can work.<\/p> <p> The other aspect is the lack of a legal obligation on employers to give notice to the trustees of a decision to wind up a defined benefit scheme.  The trustees are being left in the dark.  The Minister made a number of reasonable and valid points but it is time to call off this racket where workers and everybody else are being left in the dark.  A company could advise the trustees that the scheme was wound up at a board meeting earlier in the day and that it was making no further contributions.  In pursuing an employer through the courts, the trustees are currently at a huge disadvantage.  If the employer acts in accordance with the trust deed, there is no legislation requiring any notice period but we would not need a notice period if either of those events was triggered.<\/p> <p> There is also Deputy John Brady's Bill, which I briefly read.  That would trigger the situation and no notice period would be needed.  We would have sorted it out and would have circumvented people who are trying to circumvent their obligations.  We would have neatly snookered them, and that is our job.  It is no use having shareholders running off and smiling and 110,000 workers being left in the gap.<\/p> <p> I know what the Minister said and he is probably in the right place on this.  He has got legal advice but we could also put our collective heads together.  I acknowledge the work done by Deputies Willie O'Dea and John Brady and I wrote a letter to them.  The Minister has a pensions Bill coming forward and we have the draft heads of it.  If we do not catch him in the swings, we will catch him at the roundabouts.  I am going to convene a forum with Deputies Willie O'Dea and John Brady and bring in the NUJ and all those affected by this.  There are other companies in the south which have also been affected, and we can work this out in a collective way.  I know the Minister will park this Bill but he will not park the pensions Bill that is coming forward and we will get an opportunity to contribute to the discussion on the heads of it.  If the Minister brings forward a Bill, we will make our submissions at that point, impart our collective wisdom and in that way we will make an advance on this.  We will send a signal to workers that this is not on.  We do not want to land them into any difficulty.  The Minister said the cure could be worse than the disease.  I understand what he is saying, but there is a way around that.  It is up to us to ensure that whatever legislation we introduce in this House is effective and meets its objective, which is to protect workers and ensure we do not see them skinned of moneys that they paid into schemes.<\/p> <p> The Minister is trying to bring forward a universal pension scheme and I support him 100%.  He is right on that and I hope that will be a good legacy of his but how can he encourage people to pay into schemes in that situation when they are looking at the publicity surrounding what is going on.  I am referring to the scandal of people running away from their obligations and it is not the workers who are running away.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700050#XX00400","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486501800,"counter":596,"content":"<p>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is sharing the next time slot with Deputy Mick Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700051#YY00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1486501800,"counter":597,"content":"<p>We, in People Before Profit, welcome the fact there is a Bill before the House to deal with the crisis for workers in pensions schemes and how the attack on those pension schemes has become like a corporate grab of workers' money to be put into the coffers of the very wealthy, but there are major weaknesses in this Bill.  We will seek to amend it in that, as it stands, it would do very little to stop the effective theft of the pensioners' livelihoods.  The Bill would allow schemes to be wound up only with the approval of the Pensions Authority in certain circumstances but what is needed is a very simple Bill whereby companies that are solvent and healthy would not be able to wind up their defined benefit schemes.  That would be a much more appropriate response to what is a modern day global attack on the rights of pensioners and workers in general.<\/p><p>I have a list of global corporations extending to 15 pages that have moved in the past few years from having defined benefit to defined contribution pensions schemes.  They are household names such as Xerox, Walt Disney, Motorola, <i>The Journal-Register<\/i>, Remington, Hewlett Packard and Boeing and there are many more that have moved from having defined benefit to defined contribution pension schemes.  There is a graph with respect to Britain that clearly shows that the number of defined benefit schemes is decreasing while the number of  defined contribution pension schemes is increasing.  That move is transferring all the responsibility on to the worker.  Defined benefit schemes are being presented in the modern world as a problem, an outdated luxury that firms can no longer afford and that companies can no longer put up with.  The issue affecting us is not only a local one but a global one.  Locally, by which I mean in this state, since 2008, 65,000 workers have been affected by the closure of  defined benefit schemes.  Some 2,500 schemes of this nature existed a decade ago and today there are only 700.  The most recent illustration of this was prior to Christmas with what I would call the raid by Denis O'Brien's Independent News &amp;amp; Media and his cohort of very wealthy people on the retirement earnings of those workers in INM whose pensions had been cut by 40%, many of them moved on to a defined contribution pension scheme and a new proposal was brought in to further cut it by 30%. The effect of this so-called commercially sensible proposal was that the workers, many of whom have worked there for more than 40 years and who would expected to get a pension of &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 a year will now see their pension fall to &euro;15,000 to &euro;16,000 a year, despite having made significant contributions to their pension scheme.  That is a direct swap from the pockets of pensioners and workers to the pockets of Denis O'Brien and the very wealthy in this country.  <\/p><p>INM is an example of that, but we are also seeing that happen in Irish Life, a company that deals with individual and business pensions.  If that company, which is a very healthy one in terms of its profits and share of the market, gets away with reducing the pensions of more than 1,000 workers by moving from having a defined benefit to a defined contribution pensions scheme, we will see a domino effect in the financial sector, which has already been affected.  Aviva and Permanent TSB have done the same and Pfizer Ireland is about to do the same, as are the Grafton Group and Arnotts, and the list goes on.  We are seeing an avalanche of attacks on the pensions and future of workers.  The argument being made for this move is that workers are living longer.<\/p><p>I reject this argument.  We should be celebrating the fact that workers are living longer instead of seeing it as a problem.  What is really happening is that the attempt by the modern capitalist system to eat into the rights of workers is being escalated because it is not making the same profits from financial investments as it did in the past.  We should reject it and move to a simple system, whereby if a company was financially healthy, its defined benefit scheme could not be cut.  We should outlaw such actions and in so doing protect workers' rights and pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700051#YY00300","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486502400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Hi Mick,<\/p><blockquote>I am an employee of Pfizer, Ringaskiddy, for 22 years.  The proposed changes to the pension that the company is trying to bring in would lead me to have a shortfall of approximately &euro;286,338.  I am 51 years old, and to maintain the current value I have on defined benefit, an outlay of &euro;15,849 would be my cost per annum.  I have managed to save for my kids' college fees and am privileged to do so.  However, it was the company who afforded me this and with no discernible reason want to take it away.  With 16 years left to retire, some &euro;300 per week is the incurred cost to me as a result of the company's corporate greed.<br \/><br \/>Hi Mick,<br \/><br \/>When I joined Pfizer, Ringaskiddy, the company prided itself in taking care of our pension.  The current position by the company has left me and others to reappraise our current outgoings.  The real cost to me as an employee is &euro;390 per week.  The current profits the company enjoys as a result of Pfizer Ireland delivering quality products on time and at a competitive cost can only be quantified in the billions.  Corporate greed at its best.<\/blockquote><p>These are two text messages I received this afternoon from workers in Pfizer in Cork, a company that is trying to wind down and shut down its defined benefit scheme, a move which would adversely affect 1,000 workers.  These two workers speak for hundreds of others.  The second text message is entirely right when it speaks of &quot;corporate greed at its best&quot;.  Pfizer International made gross profits of more than $40 billion in the 12 months to 31 March 2016.  One product alone produced by the workers in the company, Viagra, makes the company a clear profit of &euro;1 billion every year.  The defined benefit scheme is a fundamental part of the terms and conditions of the workers who are taking industrial action which currently takes the form of an overtime ban to protect their terms and conditions.  I support them 100% and anybody concerned about workers' rights will do so also.<\/p><p>In 1997 there were 2,315 defined benefit schemes for employees in the State.  By the end of 2015, that figure was down to 503.  Ironically, given the source of the Bill, much of the decline took place on the watch of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  However, we, in the Anti-Austerity Alliance, will vote for the Bill which would make it illegal for a solvent company to wind up a defined benefit scheme when underfunded without the consent of the Pensions Authority.  That is positive.  It would allow a member of a scheme to appeal if he or she believed the wind-down to be inequitable.  That is also positive.  We should broaden the scope beyond mere inequity, but we could address this issue on Committee Stage.  <\/p><p>I conclude by echoing the point made by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, which is entirely right.  It is necessary to go further.  What should be in place in the law of the land is that it is illegal - full stop - to wind down a solvent fund and rob workers in the way Pfizer and so many other companies are attempting to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700052#ZZ00400","speaker":"1281"},{"type":"speech","time":1486502400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I compliment Deputy Willie O'Dea on bringing forward the Pensions (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2017.  I know that others, Deputy Willie Penrose included, brought forward a similar Bill recently.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen huge efforts by unscrupulous big businesses to avoid supporting pension schemes for people who have rightly earned their benefits.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, many small businesses and companies pay into such schemes, as do their employees.  There is a good relationship and there are honest people involved.  We cannot demonise all employers because many of them are and have been for decades supportive of schemes and engaged with their workers in the process, sometimes even without trade unions.  Arrangements are in place which are time-honoured and we must salute these companies.  Unfortunately, however, there are pressures, as well as significant greed, as seen in vulture companies.  Any company that would try to engage in this kind of action to deny workers payback for their valued and gainful employment and the way in which they supported it to get to where it is a vulture company.  These rogue employers will be very hard to stop, but the State must have the resources, the creative accountants and legal people in the Office of the Attorney General and elsewhere to ensure the passage of the Bill.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, will not oppose it, although I think he will.  I do not know why he intends to do so, given the new politics.  How many times must the Government be defeated to understand this is a new situation.  We should encourage the introduction of Private Members' Bills, especially when they are so necessary and there is such a void in legislation.  We were talking about legislation such as the Pensions Act 1990 and its many weaknesses.  We must work as a Legislature to deal where we can with issues such as this to have watertight legislation and rules companies cannot evade.<\/p>  <p>  We know what happened in Waterford Glass, a wonderful company which is close to my heart and that of Deputy Mary Butler.  I must declare an interest: I have a brother and a sister who worked for years in its Dungarvan plant.  It was world-renowned, especially in the United States.  It was gobbled up and taken over and greed again got in the way.  We are aware of the efforts that had to be made by the trade unions and other movements and politicians at the time to try to cobble something together and the taxpayer had to pick up the tab.  It was a costly experience.  The Minister has not been in government the whole time since; I am just making the point that we are too slow in closing such loopholes, especially when they affect big business.  I encourage big business and support the corporation tax rate and the attraction of big businesses, but they cannot be allowed to get away with what they should not get away with.  These are just basic rules and guidelines and good business and proper management practices so as not to allow room for creative accountants and so-called smart-arse solicitors and barristers who think they can pick at them.  That is what happens with legislation.  That is what they are paid to do and what they claim in their CVs they can do.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to wake up.  We need a public service with officials who receive proper advice and can see the loopholes.  Legislation can be passed with the best will in the world, but there may be unintended consequences.  We need to be quicker to react because every day of the week small business people with limited resources have to react in situations where they have no power over what big companies can do.  They might be a husband and a wife who are running a business, two brothers or two sisters; it could be anybody.  They have to deal with a lot of legislation.  I even heard on Marian Finucane's radio programme on Sunday that it had been decided - I do not know from where this came, as I certainly did not see the legislation that passed through the House - to allow 20 days' paid leave to an employee in the Civil Service if his or her partner or spouse passed away.  That is tragic and traumatic, but if such a provision were to be introduced in the private sector, small employers would not be able to afford or handle it.  They have certain arrangements in place and look after their staff in such cases.  They are very flexible and it works both ways for employees and employers.  It is fine if the public purse pays but not otherwise.<\/p><p>It affects everybody who is able to do it.  That kind of onerous provision on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, is a step too far.  I am not anti-worker or against someone grieving.  Most of those companies are very helpful and understanding and want a good relationship, want their employees to have that relationship and allow them to grieve and have schemes in place to support them.  <\/p> <p> This legislation is long overdue.  I note from the Minister's contribution that an employee may bring a challenge to the High Court but at what cost?  Who will pay for that challenge?  That is closing the gate when the horse has well bolted, got in the horsebox and gone home and is in the stable, a different stable, not the one he should be in.  We must look into that as well.<\/p> <p> The Minister cannot expect employees to fight the battle afterwards and go to court and whatever.  We must have the resources of the State.  The Minister must ensure he has the brightest and best to advise on this legislation.  Straightaway when it is enacted they will be picking on it, like digging the first field of potatoes and the crows land, then the jackdaws and then the scarecrows and the whole lot will come along.  These are the same.  They are vultures in any language.  We need to be there, ready, willing and able to tackle them and send them back to where they came from with their smartarse accountants and their slimy legal aides.  I could call them something stronger but I will not. <\/p> <p> There is no legal onus on the company to advise the trustees.  That is an awful flaw.  I am trustee of many companies limited by guarantee and have to take those responsibilities seriously.  We have seen what went on in a few credit unions and how one or two bad apples can destroy the whole batch.  The scandal of big business, ducking and diving, conniving and contriving to denude people of the rights they have accrued with these defined schemes is not acceptable.  It is more distasteful when they are high-powered business people and we can see their hands over everything that moves in &Eacute;ire, whether it is underground or overground, wind or water.  The only thing they do not take charge of is foul wind.  Next they will have that handicapped as well.<\/p> <p> This Bill and Deputy Willie Penrose's Bill are very timely.  Surely, instead of putting this to a vote and having the Government defeated once again, unless it is trying to break a record for the number of times a Government can be defeated in one term, the Minister could have a debate on an amalgam of the three, with the legal expertise the Minister can provide.  He could try to deal with the situation and not have any more injustices perpetrated on ordinary decent employees who made their life's commitment to those companies and not have creative accountants and smart alecs laughing all the way to the bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700052#ZZ00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486503000,"counter":602,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Social Democrats, I am happy to support the Bill before us.  I hope it will be carried to allow it go forward to Committee Stage because this is an area that has been neglected by the present and the last Governments.  It is hard to see any circumstances in which it is defensible that a profitable company that has entered into a contractual arrangement with its employees to maintain a defined benefit scheme should be allowed to renege on that commitment and walk away from the agreement with promises to its workers.  This situation has obtained for some time and has come up on a regular basis, particularly in the context of the annual social welfare and the social welfare and pensions Bill.  There have been various attempts to close this loophole, which the present Government resisted a few months ago and by the previous Government.  I was looking at notes in my office.  Deputy O'Dea will be familiar with the amendment to the then Social Welfare and Pensions Bill that several of us put our names to in 2014, stating a sovereign firm shall not be allowed to close a defined benefit pension scheme except where the scheme has reached a minimum of 90% funding standard.  The then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection argued vehemently against the amendment and refused point blank to give it any serious consideration.  It is somewhat ironic that the then T&aacute;naiste's party comes along with Deputy Willie Penrose's Bill.  I heard Deputy Willie Penrose making the case and he has received a lot of publicity for various press statements issued in his name saying he was going to sort out this problem.  In 2014 when the Labour Party was in a position to do something about this it refused to accept that amendment.  There is a big element of crocodile tears on Deputy Willie Penrose's part.  Others, however, who put their names to that amendment still fight the good fight in respect of what many of us believe are the State's responsibilities to ensure that they uphold the rights of workers in companies where there is no excuse for them to renege on pension commitments other than the fact that there are funding difficulties in the pension scheme.  The company may be solvent and doing well yet our Government seems to think it is perfectly acceptable for a company in those circumstances to walk away.  Most right thinking people do not accept that is all right and think companies should not be allowed to do this. <\/p>  <p>  Solvent companies in other jurisdictions, particularly in the United Kingdom, are not allowed to shirk their responsibilities and renege on their commitments in this way.  The sky has not fallen in as a result of this in the United Kingdom and there is no reason we should not have the same kind of regime in this country and place the same obligations on profitable employers to uphold the commitments they have given.<\/p>  <p>  The point was made that if Government moved to prevent companies walking away from their defined benefit commitments a flood of companies would do that and attempt to close down schemes.  These matters must be dealt with properly and cleverly, and the Government by right, if it was of a mind to address this loophole in our pension law, would move to do that very speedily and avoid giving notice to companies and so encouraging them to wind up their schemes.  It is possible to do it and that was done in the United Kingdom.  There is no reason that should not be the case here. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is standing idly by and allowing companies do this to their workers, which is not only a serious injustice to workers who have paid into a defined benefit scheme for 25, 30 or 35 years, leaving them high and dry, but also has implications for State funds because many who lose their defined benefit pension have to claim a non-contributory pension from the State.  Once again, the State is picking up the tab for the failure of regulation of private sector companies and that should not be allowed because it is another form of bailout.  Overall, the Minister has been exceptionally quiet on pension policy.  In response to a recent parliamentary question of mine he referred only to State pension provision.<\/p><p>My understanding has been that even though the Minister for Social Protection is supposed to have responsibility for pension policy, a kind of good cop, bad cop game has always been played between that Minister and the Minister for Finance, who decides when it comes to budget time on the kind of pension tax relief that is allowed and whether it is to continue.  Perhaps this has changed.<\/p> <p> We have an extremely unfair pension system in this country.  We spend over &euro;2 billion on tax relief to assist those who are in a position to put away substantial pension funds.  Their handsome pension pots are being subsidised, in effect, by people who cannot afford to make pension provision for themselves.  It is entirely unfair that 80% of pension tax relief is benefiting approximately 20% of pensioners.  We were promised severe restrictions in this regard.  Some restrictions have been introduced, but they are nothing like what was promised.  The previous Government undertook to ensure nobody with a pension of more than &euro;60,000 would be able to benefit from pension tax relief.  Unfortunately, that has not been the case.  Many people with pensions in excess of that figure are still benefiting from tax relief.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister's thinking on the need for the State pension to become the mainstay of the pension regime.  We need to move from the huge cross-subsidisation that exists at present, which ensures those who are better off in society, by and large, are subsidised by people on much lower incomes.  The entirely unfair regime that is currently in place is yet another regrettable example of how private sector pensioners are being denied the kind of protection they should be receiving from the State.  I am happy to support the Bill in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700053#AAA00200","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486503600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputies Eugene Murphy and Fiona O'Loughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700054#BBB00200","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1486503600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

In 2014, an OECD report highlighted the need for beneficiaries to receive greater protection when defined benefit schemes wind up.  According to the OECD report:<\/p><blockquote>Another weakness of Irish legislation is that it allows healthy sponsors to &quot;walk away&quot; from DB pension plans, shutting them down, without creating a high-priority debt on the employer, as is the case for instance in the United Kingdom.  Under the UK's &quot;debt upon employer obligation&quot;, the sponsor's debt (if the plan is underfunded) is determined by valuing the benefits on the basis that they are bought out in full via immediate annuities (for pensioners) or deferred annuities (for non-pensioners).<\/blockquote><p>The Minister needs to get real on this issue.  He has indicated during D&aacute;il debates that he has no plans to introduce legislation, even though it is abundantly clear that legislation is required and has been for some time.<\/p><p>Many company employee schemes have been wrapped up by employers.  I am sure other companies are licking their lips as they watch what is going on in cases like Waterford Crystal, Aer Lingus and Independent News &amp;amp; Media and wonder what is going to happen.  That is why legislation is needed.  Defined benefit pension schemes have been in funding crisis for a number of years.  Many schemes do not meet the required funding standard because of the worldwide market turmoil since 2007.  It is reported that 30% of Irish schemes do not meet the funding standard.  Other causes of this shortfall include increased life expectancy, the increased cost of buying annuities for pensioners and the rate of increase of final salaries.  In essence, the projected assets do not meet the projected liabilities.  As a result, many defined benefit schemes have been closed off to new members.<\/p><p>The Bill aims to address the issue of solvent companies closing defined benefit pension schemes to the detriment of scheme members.  At present, Irish legislation does not require an employer that initiates the closure of a scheme to ensure it is brought to a level of full funding, as is the case in the United Kingdom.  Under-funding is a debt which can be legally enforced.  Our view is that profitable firms should not be allowed to walk away from defined benefit schemes.  I hope this legislation is not too late.

I am sure workers who have made contributions are asking themselves why they are suffering.  We are now seeing people who were fortunate enough to have had jobs all their lives having to sign on at the age of 65 until they reach the pension age of 67.

Many people who have made major contributions to this country's economy have suffered as a result of what has happened.  Profitable companies must be prevented from winding up their defined benefit schemes.<\/p><p>I was disappointed to read through the document that was circulated by the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, this evening.  As Deputy John Brady said, the Minister's document gives the impression that there is not much he can do.  Every page of the document is very negative towards workers.  I have to say it is not the stuff of a would-be Taoiseach.  I hope the Minister does not mind when I say that.  He more or less said he could not do anything about these problems.  He contradicted himself in one respect.  I suggest he acknowledged that there are problems in this regard when he said:<\/p><blockquote>Further steps can and should be taken regarding the funding standard.  Following discussions between my officials, the Pensions Authority, the Society of Actuaries in Ireland and the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the Pensions Authority will shortly bring forward proposals to allow some additional flexibility for defined benefit schemes and to tackle some of the difficulties with the current operation of the standard.  I intend to consult employer and union representatives on these proposals before making any changes.<\/blockquote><p>However, he concluded by telling the House with regret that he was unable to support the Bill.<\/p><p>It is quite clear from what has been said this evening by Deputies on all sides of the House that the Government will lose a vote on this Bill on Thursday if it does not reconsider its approach in this regard.  This matter must be addressed because workers throughout this country are being treated most unfairly.  I emphasise that companies that can live up to their responsibilities from a financial perspective should not be allowed to use the back door to evade those responsibilities.  I fully commend Deputy Willie O'Dea for the introduction of this sensible and reasonable Bill.  This is no more than what we should be doing for workers up and down this country who deserve these protections.  We should not let them down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700054#BBB00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1486503600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>It used to be said that death and taxes were the two certainties in life.  It is very clear that is there is now another certainty.  Thankfully, people are growing older and living longer and healthier lives.  There is no doubt that as a result, people need to put pension plans in place to ensure they have adequate finance in place when they are not working, when they are older or when they cannot work to ensure they can support themselves to a reasonable living standard.  It is more important than ever for public and private pension schemes to be robust.<\/p><p>It is very clear from what Deputy Willie O'Dea said that legislation needs to be brought forward to address the situation where a profitable company can close down a defined benefit pension scheme while the scheme is in deficit.  This is to the detriment of existing and deferred pensioners, of whom there are 650,000 in the country at present.  In the last D&aacute;il, Fine Gael had a very poor record in regard to private pensions and the last Government passed legislation to allow the Government to raid the private pensions of citizens.  Now, it is refusing to act to protect other private pensioners.<\/p> <p> We have seen very profitable companies wind up defined benefit pension schemes, which has left workers with nothing.  This situation is unacceptable and needs to be addressed and it can be addressed through the Bill Deputy Willie O'Dea has brought forward.  The 2014 OECD report highlighted there was a greater need for protection for beneficiaries.  The report stated: \"Another weakness of Irish legislation is that it allows healthy sponsors to &lsquo;walk away&rsquo; from DB pension plans, shutting them down, without creating a high-priority debt on the employer, as is the case for instance in the United Kingdom.\"  There is no doubt defined benefit pension schemes have been in a funding crisis for a number of years and some 30% of schemes in Ireland are reported not to meet the funding standard.  It is our view that profitable firms should not be allowed to walk away from a defined benefit scheme.<\/p> <p> A completely different set of priority rules will apply on the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme where the employer and the scheme are both insolvent, that is, where there is a double insolvency.  In this scenario, all beneficiaries of the scheme are to receive 50% of their benefits, including post-retirement pension increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700054#BBB00600","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486504200,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  It has been informative and helpful to have a detailed debate around the issues relating to defined benefit pension schemes, which have over 660,000 members in Ireland.  The problems of defined benefit pension schemes involve different issues which interact and require diverse potential policy responses.  Due to demographic, economic and financial factors, the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the investment returns earned by pension schemes.  Unfortunately, there are no simple solutions to these issues.  These problems are not unique to Ireland.  As we have seen from BHS and Tata Steel in the United Kingdom, even the existence of debt on the employer and a pension protection fund have not prevented problems from happening.  The key objective for all of us is the same, namely, to ensure that scheme members are protected in so far as is possible while maintaining the balance between the key stakeholders of the members, the sponsoring employer and the trustees.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate some of the points made earlier by the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  The imposition of both a pension protection fund and a debt on the employer was considered thoroughly a number of times in recent years due to the problems encountered with defined benefit schemes.  There are clear advantages to such proposals, but there are also strong reasons they are not desirable.  A pension protection fund may impose additional costs which lead to defined benefit scheme closures; it may lead to unintended consequences, for example, the under-funding of pensions in advance of liquidation; it may result in riskier investment strategies; it may increase pension benefits rather than wages in companies at risk; it may lead to the early retirement of directors taking substantial benefits; it may make stronger companies cross-subsidise the weakest; it may drive companies overseas to avoid paying; it may be prone to economic cycles - for example, in a downturn, it is exposed to significant demands which it may not be able to meet; and it may be administratively complex and costly.<\/p>  <p>  A debt on the employer may threaten the company's financial stability and, in some circumstances, render employers insolvent; it may impact on the company's creditors; it may impact on company debt, investment and growth and the employers' ability to raise funds; it may give a competitive advantage to employers which never provided a pension and those with \"risk-free\" defined contribution schemes; it may prompt well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid future debt; it may need complex and costly structures to administer such arrangements; and it may result in increased and detailed State involvement in sponsoring employers' business decisions.<\/p>  <p>  The changes that were made in recent years to the Pensions Act had the central objective of making the situation more sustainable and these changes have provided a level of stability.  Rather than implementing a solution of putting a debt on the employer with unknown consequences, the approach taken to date is to support schemes to gradually move to a better funding position using regulation and the benefits of a strengthening economy.  Changes such as the pensions insolvency payments scheme, sovereign annuities, the introduction of a risk reserve and allowing for the restructuring of scheme benefits are all measures which have been introduced with this approach in mind.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the intention behind the Bill is to alleviate the issues that are continuing in defined benefit schemes.  Nobody thinks it is right for sponsoring employers which have made commitments to walk away from their obligations.  However, the position is not as black and white as that.  There has to be fairness in the playing field between employers which have provided well for their staff over the years by contributing to a good pension scheme and those which have not.  There has to be a balance between an employer being able to continue to operate and keep employees in jobs and living up to pension commitments made to those employees and former employees.  In any legislation, there is a danger of unintended consequences, so any changes need to be carefully analysed and crafted, and followed by a thorough debate on proposed changes.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth recalling some of the dangers and possible unintended consequences of the Bill.  Rather than being protected as they are currently, the Bill could expose existing pensioners who are already retired to having their pensions cut substantially in the event of a wind-up.  In some cases, stopping a pension scheme from winding up or \"extend and pretend\" will result in a far worse outcome for some scheme members, particularly younger ones.  The scheme would have to continue with solvency potentially deteriorating, and older members using up the assets before younger members retire.  The extra funding burden would accelerate the closure of defined benefit schemes in the private sector.  Therefore, the result of such a change, designed to protect the position of defined benefit pension members, would be the opposite of that intended.  Few, if any, such defined pension schemes would remain.  It could jeopardise the viability of the business and the jobs of those employed, given employers lack of capacity to absorb this extra cost.  In such cases, people could lose their jobs long before becoming eligible for a pension.  It could encourage imprudent investment behaviour by trustees and any losses would have to be made good by the employer.<\/p>  <p>  Pension reforms impact not just on what is happening now but can have huge repercussions on outcomes for people for decades to come.  The Minister will in the near future bring forward proposals to address certain aspects of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes.  This will include looking at annuity costs in funding standard calculations, perhaps providing additional flexibility for schemes where funding proposals have gone off track, and taking account of employer commitments to support their defined benefit schemes.  These will be carefully thought out and fully analysed to help support schemes and their members.<\/p>  <p>  I assure Deputies that the Government is very conscious of the issues raised in the Bill.  The over-riding priority for the State in this area is to ensure pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.  I hope Deputies now understand why the Bill is being opposed and that the changes proposed would do more harm than good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700055#CCC00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1486504200,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has just stated: \"The over-riding priority for the State in this area is to ensure pensioners and members of pension schemes are protected and the future viability and sustainability of their schemes is ensured and made safer.\"  We all share that objective but the Government keeps long-fingering it, which is no comfort to those pensioners in schemes where the management is making decisions such as those made by INM, and also by Waterford Crystal way back, when the same dangers about which Deputy Mary Butler spoke were evident.  Nothing was done then to change the law, or only very small changes were made, yet this is the same law that allowed INM and many other companies to do this.<\/p>  <p>  The point about the INM case is that it helped to articulate what is happening in many smaller companies throughout the country and what has happened to many thousands of people, yet we still have not put the protections in place and we keep pushing it out for another six months.  I do not know what it is about this Government's attitude to Deputy Willie O'Dea's legislation.  We were here ten days ago discussing Deputy Willie O'Dea's issues around the fair deal scheme and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, wanted six months to deal with them.  Tonight, the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has committed to having a report from the Pensions Board within six months.  Many people do not have that six months because decisions are going to be made about their futures.<\/p>  <p>  This is increasingly a country where people do not want to get old because they no longer have the guarantees that were associated with a working life, with putting in the hours, with doing the days and the nights, and, at the end of it, having a pension to look forward to, which was paid at age 65 years.  We have given that up in recent years and people no longer even have that guarantee.<\/p><p>The worst possible thing has been happening.  People have not been given the chance to put the pot back together.  This is the pot that they did nothing to destroy.  People in their 60s are being told that nothing is available or that what is available is only minimal.  They do not have the chance to put the pot back together, even though they did not destroy it in the first place.  Then they end up coming to the State.<\/p> <p> The Minister has spoken on many occasions about this as one of the greatest challenges facing the country, yet his Department keeps asking for more time.  We do not have time.  I regret that the Minister has decided to oppose the Bill.  Deputy Willie O'Dea has been working on this for approximately 18 months.  This is not something he has come to only lately.  The Minister might disagree with Deputy Willie O'Dea's politics, but he cannot disagree with his technical knowledge and understanding of pensions and accountancy.  It is regrettable that the Minister has decided to oppose the Bill rather than allow it to go to Committee Stage, where he could take the ideas of Deputy Willie Penrose on board.  Deputy Willie Penrose has some good ideas and has done much good work.  The Minister should try to come up with a shared ambition on Committee Stage around pension protection.<\/p> <p> We are almost one year on from the general election and one year into new politics.  I am sceptical about it and unsure whether it is delivering.  However, it might start tonight.  The House has said that we need to do something about pensions.  The Government disagrees and suggests that it needs more time.  The House is about to say that we want something done about pensions on behalf of the people who put us here, on behalf of the people who are being left without a pension or a scheme.  The same people see those in management in these companies going off with big packages.  I am not suggesting this Bill is the perfect article.  Let us consider what happened in the United Kingdom with the Arcadia Group.  That was one of the worst cases.  We need to ensure the same thing does not happen here.<\/p> <p> The Minister also has responsibility for another aspect of pensions.  I am referring to women who have paid pension contributions over the years and who took time out of work to raise families or to go back into the home.  These women have been left short in their pension as a result.  They have been penalised for having taken time away from the workplace to rear a family.  They were not penalised by the Minister but by his predecessor, the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, in one of the cruellest actions of the last Government.  This is only now becoming apparent as women are coming to retirement age or pension age.  They find they are being fleeced by the State for doing the job of the State on many occasions, either by caring for children or parents.  We have all seen it.  Any Deputy worth his or her salt has met it on a daily basis.  We have to do something about it.<\/p> <p> It is regrettable that the Minister is opposing the Bill.  However, the will of the House to deal with pensions as a matter of urgency will prevail.  This is the first time that new politics might deliver for the people outside the House.  We should let the committee deal with the concerns expressed by the Minister as well as with the inputs from Deputies Willie Penrose and John Brady.  The Minister should allow Deputy Willie O'Dea to work on this issue on an all-party basis with the roadmap he has laid out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700055#CCC00300","speaker":"1335","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1486504800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who has contributed.

On each occasion the Government shot it down.  The amendment was along the lines of what is contained in Deputy John Brady's Bill.  I mean no disrespect.  Having studied the situation in the United Kingdom closely, I decided to bring in a moderated version of the Bill because of the difficulties I saw with it.  I did not know about them until I got time to study it.  Having done that, I prepared the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Deputy John Brady has prepared a Bill and that Deputy Willie Penrose has prepared another Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il is taking Private Members' time tonight.  We decided this was the issue we would raise during Private Members' time.  It does not really matter to me which Bill comes first.  If the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill or the Labour Party Bill had come first, we would have supported either of them equally because we support the principle.  I am willing to work with my two Opposition colleagues in advance of the legislation the Minister intends to bring forward sometime in March.  However, I do not have great expectations for that legislation, judging from the attitude of the Minister at Question Time last week, as well as tonight.  I find his position somewhat strange in view of the fact that I remember the time when the entire country was discussing the situation at Independent News &amp;amp; Media.  The Minister and I were in RTE on a television programme.  The Minister proceeded to tell the nation that he was so concerned he would rush to the High Court the following morning and intervene through the Attorney General or whatever.  I wonder what became of that intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the fact that the Minister recognises that something has to be done about the minimum funding standard.  He is proposing to do precisely what I have suggested in section 4.<\/p>  <p>  I must confess to being disappointed in respect of the other matter.  We are not talking about something new.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  This type of legislation has been in existence in the United Kingdom for the past 21 years.  When it was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1995, that country was in the teeth of a vicious recession.  This was at the end of the Thatcher Government of the late 1980s and the early 1990s.  There were problems with deficits.  Schemes were under pressure.  All the arguments were trotted out.  The UK Government at the time, in its wisdom, decided that the best thing was to ensure the balance of advantage lay with protecting the member or the person who had paid into the scheme as opposed to being overly concerned about the employer.  Numerous debates and discussions have taken place in the United Kingdom in recent years.  Some have argued that section 75 protection, which we are seeking to give in this Bill, should be withdrawn.  Arguments were made in favour of it by some &ndash; there are several arguments in favour of it.  Counter arguments were made by others.  The preponderance of opinion on all sides, including the Tory Government at the time, was that the balance of advantage should lie with the need to protect the workers.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister's argument seems to be reduced to a simple position.  He sets out the familiar arguments on both sides, then he takes the side of the employers.  He takes the side of the people who walk away.  This means solvent employers can walk away from pension schemes that they have let run down to the detriment of their employees.  It is simply a question of what people believe or what side they wish to take.<\/p>  <p>  I have been surprised by some of the language used in the Minister's response.  He has made reference to no readily available accurate consistent measure of solvency.  Has the Minister ever heard of bankruptcy law?  The courts are adjudicating every day of the week.  Accountants are adjudicating.  Liquidators are adjudicating on whether a company has become insolvent.  The Minister made reference to there being no connection between a company being solvent or having net revenues at a given point in time and that company's ability to fund a scheme for the long term.  Having worked for several years in the largest accountancy firm in the country, I am fully aware of the position.  I can inform the House what it is: all that is meaningless jargon.  I think it was Oscar Wilde who said that sometimes one excuse is more believable than several.  I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  We will be pushing the Bill to a vote on Thursday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700056#DDD00200","speaker":"1227"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486504800,"counter":614,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1486504800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 9 February 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700056#DDD00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1486504800,"counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700056#DDD00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1486504800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment has concluded its consideration of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) (Amendment) Bill 2016 and has made no amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700056#DDD00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1486504800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.50 p.m. until 12 noon on Wednesday, 8 February 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
