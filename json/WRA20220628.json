The EU and Morocco also signed an Agreement on additional liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, and fish and fisheries products, which entered into force in October 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Both parties agreed upon a protocol establishing a Dispute Settlement Mechanism, which entered into force in 2012. Negotiations for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) started in 2013. The last negotiating round was held in April 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The EU-Morocco Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA), concluded in March 2019, allocates fishing opportunities for the EU in exchange for an overall financial contribution of &euro;208 million. A substantial part of this contribution is used to promote the sustainable development of the fisheries economy in Morocco and the Western Sahara. <\/p>  <p>  Under the FPA, Ireland is entitled to receive quotas as follows over the four-year period &ndash; Year 1 &ndash; 3,099 tonnes, Year 2 &ndash; 3,281 tonnes, Years 3 &amp;amp; 4 &ndash; 3,646 tonnes in the FPA&rsquo;s industrial pelagic category. However, no Irish fishing vessels are currently operating in Morocco and no Irish fishing vessels have operated in Morocco  since 2007. The allocation has, in the past, been swapped with other member states. <\/p>  <p>  When the process of negotiation began on the current FPA agreement, Ireland sought that any agreement should be more transparent and should include clear and specific reporting on the benefits of the Agreement in the Western Sahara. Ireland supported the adoption of the FPA, issuing the following statement on its adoption:<\/p>  <p>  'Ireland stress the importance of a strong political and economic partnership between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland underlines the importance of complying with EU law, of which international law may be considered an integral part when entering into bilateral agreements. We have taken careful note of the &ldquo;&ldquo;Contribution of the Council Legal Service on the Draft amended Fisheries Agreement and draft new Fisheries Protocol with Morocco- compatibility with the case-law of the Court&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently emphasized that an agreement has to be consistent with the judgment of the Court of Justice handed down on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266\/16. We take the content and form of the Contribution as evidence that the Council Legal Service considers that entering into the presented agreement is fully consistent with the judgment of the Court of Justice handed down on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266\/16 and does not prejudice the status of Western Sahara. Ireland continues to support the United Nations process to find a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution for Western Sahara.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, Ireland supports the adoption of the Council decision on the amendment of the Fisheries Agreement and the Fisheries Protocol'.<\/p>  <p>  The question of the territorial applicability of certain EU-Morocco agreements is the subject of ongoing legal consideration at the European level. Ireland notes the October 2021 European Court of Justice ruling that annulled the EU&rsquo;s previous approval of agriculture and fishing agreements that allowed Morocco to exports goods from Western Sahara. That decision is currently being appealed. Ireland will await the outcome of this process and, together with our EU partners, give careful consideration to the decision reached. <\/p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland&rsquo;s long-held position is that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory. We support the United Nations Security Council Resolutions, which support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Morocco, to better adapt them to today&rsquo;s challenges, notably in respect of value chains and the greening and digitalisation of respective economies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800070#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":155,"content":"<p>Question No. 129 answered with Question No. 128.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Relations","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800070#WRD01600"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[33685\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800070#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if the consultation process for the industrial relations provisions in respect of pension entitlements of retired workers Bill 2021 has concluded; if so, the measures that he proposes to take with the draft legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":158,"content":"<p>The consultation process on the\u00a0Retired Workers\u00a0Access to industrial relations mechanisms for pension related issues which was conducted by my Department concluded a number of weeks ago.<\/p><p>My Department officials have commenced the examination of\u00a0submissions received.

It is important to note that this assessment process is informed only by financial, technical and environmental considerations and not by energy security or broader energy policy matters.   In March 2022, the European Council directed the European Commission to develop a plan that will phase out EU dependence on Russian fossil fuel imports.

The targets to be set out in respect of a sector must include appropriate targets in respect of reductions in material resource consumption and the use of non-recyclable material; increases in the use of reusable products and materials; increased levels of repair and re-use; or improved maintenance and optimised use of goods, products and materials. The strategy must also set out the actions necessary to meet those targets. I have also agreed to publish a report on how the use of single use packaging used in the sale of fruit and vegetables can be reduced.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures aimed at significantly reducing the amount of plastic packaging placed on the Irish market are already in place. The Single Use Plastics Regulations 2021\u00a0includes outright bans on specific single-use items, labelling requirements for certain products and the introduction of a number of new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Also, the Waste Directive Regulations 2020 introduced a new requirement for collective EPR schemes to &ldquo;eco&rdquo; modulate the financial contributions paid by producers. The provision incentivises producers to design products that contribute to waste prevention and facilitate recycling by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and their recyclability.\u00a0Essentially, recyclable packaging incurs lower fees than non-recyclable packaging; penalising non-recyclable composites and over-packaging.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that\u00a0has the statutory responsibility\u00a0for the regulation of\u00a0fares in relation to public passenger transport services and for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.\u00a0 The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.\u00a0 The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost. \u00a0The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Providing free public transport is often seen as a silver bullet solution to our transport and climate challenges. And while I recognise the importance of incentivising greater use of our public transport services, I am not convinced that providing free public transport is the most balanced means of achieving this objective.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  COVID gave us some insight into the level of funding that might be required in the absence of fare revenue. For example, in 2020, an additional &euro;370 million was required to enable the continued operation of public transport services due to the collapse of fare intake. In 2021, &euro;659m was required to run PSO services, and this year we have allocated &euro;538 million for the continuation of these essential services. Apportioning such significant levels of Exchequer resources to one goal undoubtedly impacts the State&rsquo;s ability to support other worthy public services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While I might not agree that free transport provides the answer, I do believe there is merit in incentivising fares when an appropriate balance can be struck. In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, I was delighted to introduce the Young Adult Card in May which will\u00a0allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an average of discount of 50% on public transport fares. In addition, a 20% average PSO fare reduction was introduced as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin.\u00a0In May alone, the number of people who had a Child Leap Card, Student Leap Card, or the new Young Adult Leap Card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.<\/p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.\u00a0\u00a0In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30th  \u00a0of June 2022. To date over &euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the YAC will be broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.\u00a0\u00a0The National Transport Authority (NTA) is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.\u00a0 Any\u00a0assessment of a proposed change to\u00a0public transport fare structures\u00a0would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputies specific questions in relation to free transport, to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800072#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taxi Licences","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800072#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[33702\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800072#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has met with companies (details supplied) to discuss the taxi shortages in Dublin; if not, if he will seek such meetings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>The regulation of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector is a matter for the independent transport regulator, the National Transport Authority (NTA), under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Dispatch operators are regulated in Ireland by the NTA.\u00a0 They are permitted to provide bookings to SPSV licenced drivers using SPSV licensed vehicles, only.\u00a0 \u00a0A fundamental tenet of Ireland&rsquo;s SPSV regulatory regime is that only SPSV licenced drivers and vehicles are used for the carriage of passengers for reward.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's regulatory framework requires that all drivers and vehicles are licensed, as a means of protecting the consumer and helping ensure public safety.

These Safety Recommendations have been deemed either closed or in process of implementation. This reflects the significant work done by the Department and the Irish Coast Guard since the tragic loss of R116 in 2017. Where a Recommendation is in process of implementation the Department clearly set out next steps and timeframes for completion and the AAIU has acknowledged the proposed steps.<\/p>  <p>  In the week following the publication of the AAIU report into the accident I and my colleague Minister Eamon Ryan spoke extensively in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad respectively (17th and 18th November) outlining the progress which had been made which I can refer to here.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department did not wait for the publication of the final report to implement changes on foot of the lessons learned following the accident. Since March 2017, and specifically following receipt of the draft final report in September 2019, the Department and, in particular, the Irish Coast Guard, have undertaken a significant programme of change across key areas to take account of issues raised and recommendations addressed to me.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the interim report of the air accident investigation unit, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport commissioned an independent review of oversight arrangements for search and rescue aviation operations in Ireland. Following publication of the independent review, known as the AQE report, in September 2018, the then Minister committed to implementing its 12 recommendations. The measures that have been taken fall under six broad categories: the development of a new national search and rescue framework, the national SAR plan or NSP; enhancing safety and oversight across the search and rescue system; addressing oversight of search and rescue aviation elements nationally and internationally; the review and revision of all relevant standard operating procedures and training for Coast Guard personnel, in particular rescue co-ordination centre staff training, with a focus on aviation tasking including the introduction of a formal course on tasking of aviation assets delivered by an IAA authorised training organisation; the development of an externally accredited safety management system in the Coast Guard; and a review of governance arrangements in regard to the aviation contractor, enhancing aviation expertise in critical areas and legislative reform of the IAA.<\/p>  <p>  A new search and rescue framework, the NSP, which provides for more explicit governance, assurance and oversight roles across the SAR system, was noted by Government and published in July 2019. The key objectives of the NSP are to achieve a rebalancing of the previous maritime-centric SAR framework to encompass air and land SAR more comprehensively; establish effective governance, oversight and assurance across the SAR system to take account of national and international obligations; achieve clarity on roles, inter-relationships and responsibilities from the strategic through to tactical and operational levels; develop a common approach to managing SAR incidents across the three domains; to set priorities, objectives and performance expectations, measure performance at system level; and provide a sound and clear basis for continuous improvement.<\/p>  <p>  The NSP sets out more explicit governance, assurance and oversight roles across the SAR system. The plan resets a more strategic and focused national search and rescue committee with a leaner and more coherent set of sub-committees, including an SAR consultative committee, a regulators forum, a health and safety forum and an aviation forum. The plan also sets out a clear description of the national SAR system, including roles, inter-relationships and responsibilities from the strategic through to tactical and operational levels.<\/p>  <p>  Another deliverable was an implementation plan for the recommended model for a joint rescue co-ordination centre, JRCC. It is a special type of rescue co-ordination centre that is operated by personnel from the maritime rescue co-ordination centre and the aviation rescue co-ordination centre. This virtual JRCC is intended to capitalise on the strengths of the current model, minimising disruption and exploiting opportunities for enhanced technology, closer co-operation and revised operating procedures, notably to address the vulnerabilities identified in the existing model and to provide for stronger oversight arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the new joint model. The Coast Guard and IAA have agreed a concept of operations and procedures manual and this work has resulted in increased collaboration and professional interaction between the Coast Guard and the aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre. Formal establishment is subject to the filling of newly established positions in the Coast Guard rescue co-ordination centre following a public appointments service process.<\/p>  <p>  As an appendix to the NSP, guidance is provided on the development of a common approach to managing SAR incidents across all three domains of land, maritime and aeronautical SAR, including the transition from search and rescue to search and recovery. It was agreed that the NSP would be delivered on a phased basis to enable a managed and integrated approach to the development of the new SAR structures, along with the coherent development of memoranda of understanding and service level agreements between all relevant stakeholders to underpin the new assurance mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  Since then, progress in delivering key aspects of the implementation plan has been good, with the majority of actions completed and the remainder on track for delivery in 2022. The actions include the first annual report of the NSARC on the NSP, which was approved in July of last year and subsequently published by the Government on gov.ie. The second annual report will be presented shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Key performance indicators for the NSP are being developed by a dedicated working group. The development of a new dynamic SAR assets register is under way. A new aviation training programme for Irish Coast Guard staff provided by an IAA approved training provider is ongoing. In addition to the Irish Coast Guard staff, course participants include aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the Garda air support unit, which is indicative of the increased collaboration between the three SAR co-ordinators.<\/p>  <p>  As mentioned earlier, in light of safety recommendations, the Coast Guard is building on its safety management system, which encompasses all aspects of its operations. The safety management system will be externally accredited to ISO 45001. A review and revision of all relevant standard operating procedures and training of Coast Guard personnel was completed and updated on foot of incident reviews under the Coast Guard continuous improvement regime.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to implementing a safety management system to ISO 45001 the Coast Guard is in the final stages of work to prepare for accreditation later this year. The Coast Guard is also implementing a range of measures which represent a SAR assurance system. This includes updating and renewing its memorandums of understanding, MOUs, with SAR co-ordinators and SAR facility providers. MOUs are based on an agreed template setting out respective roles and responsibilities, services provided, availability and oversight arrangements. This includes continuous system improvement, risk assessment and safety management. The vast majority of these MOUs are completed with first-line SAR facility providers and SAR co-ordinators. Work is ongoing with the remaining support organisations with which the Coast Guard has links.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative framework for the regulation of coast guard aviation activities continues to be enhanced. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), in consultation with the IRCG and the Department, developed a revised set of regulations and detailed rules specific to search and rescue. These were published on 1 June. Further national legislation for coast guard aviation operations is set out in the Irish Aviation Authority (Regulation of Irish Coast Guard Aviation Operations) Order 2022 (S.I. 212 of 2022) which came into force on 1 May. The IAA is developing procedures to transition from the existing SAR Approval to a National Coast Guard Approval provided for in S.I. 212 of 2022, which will provide for a single regulatory framework to cover all coast guard aviation activities. The IAA, the IRCG and the Department, will continue to work closely together to enhance the regulation and oversight of coast guard aviation operations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I hope this account satisfies the Deputy, further information and general information on the Search and Rescue services work in Ireland will be available in the National SAR Plan Annual Report to be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800072#WRF05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800072#WRF05300"},{"type":"question","counter":316,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[33962\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800072#WRF05400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when works will commence on upgrading Fintra Bridge, County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.

Increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare which is charged for journeys taken between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays \/ public holidays, is designed to encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally.  Whilst the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating (licensing and enforcement) the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework.  Additionally, SPSV operators choose the times at which they operate.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the NTA introduced several supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licensed SPSVs to continue in the industry during the very difficult period. These included several extensions of the maximum vehicle age on an emergency basis.  The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure during Covid to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period.  It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licences will return now that demand for services is increasing. <\/p>  <p>  The SPSV motor tax refund scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  I provided funding of &euro;2m to the Scheme which commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax.  The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022. <\/p>  <p>  I also allocated &euro;1.5m to the NTA to fund initial NCT fees for SPSV operators for a 12-month period.  This Scheme also commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free until 31 August 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the number of SPSV licences issued or renewed, this is a matter for the NTA.

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. For this reason, HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not been previously been used as a dwelling. <\/p>  <p>  A move to include other properties previously used as a residential home\/second-hand properties\u00a0within the scope of the scheme itself\u00a0would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. Extending the HTB scheme in this way would provide no incentive effect\u00a0to encourage the building of new homes and would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost. For these reasons, I currently have no plans to extend the HTB scheme to include such properties. <\/p>  <p>  In considering tax expenditures, I must always be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer.\u00a0Owing to this, proposals for such measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.\u00a0The guidelines make clear that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, work by\u00a0external consultants\u00a0on the review of HTB is currently under way.

In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1\/1\/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%.

I will arrange for my officials to provide the briefing note and recommendations given to me in advance of same, along with other supporting documentation. <\/p>  <p>The review of the derogation process prepared by Aniar Ecology in 2018, in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, was based on a number of surveys, data sources and publications and provided an estimate of trends for common breeding birds.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.\u00a0The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services, 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of\u00a0years, even\u00a0when\u00a0staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in\u00a0other areas of the local authority sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'.

There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including Local Government, fire service management\/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management before the end of the year.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management will make a determination on the publication of the report.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following the delivery of the Retained Fire services review report, any recommendations made to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management&rsquo;s Board, to address the issues raised in relation to the recruitment and retention of Retained Firefighters, will need to be considered with stakeholders.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Comprehensive updates on the progress of the report have been positively received by the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group. There is broad agreement that the survey outcomes are reflective of feedback received directly from Retained Fire service members previously, and that the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group remains the appropriate forum for feedback on the report as it progresses to its final submission to the National Directorate for Fire Emergency Management Board. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03100"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[33871\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of former county managers or CEOs of local authorities who are currently employed on a freelance basis or otherwise to carry out works for local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>My Department does not hold the information requested.<\/p><p>Under Section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authority for which he or she is responsible. <\/p><p>The information should be available from each local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03400"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":259,"qnumall":"[33885\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the engagement, if any, that he has had with the Residential Tenancies Board in relation to its availability to both tenants and the landlord; if it has been flagged with him that there is difficulty in contacting the RTB directly by phone or by email; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[33886\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800077#WRL03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will assist a person (details supplied) in contacting the Residential Tenancies Board to register a property in order that a family can continue to reside there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 and 260 together.<\/p>  <p>The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants and as such, the implementation of the new tenancy management system is an operational matter for the RTB. <\/p>  <p>  Due to the quasi-judicial nature of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to provide legal advice, comment on, or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that some landlord and agent customers are encountering issues with the new RTB tenancy management system, but it is important that landlords and agents complete the process for account verification on the new system.

The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020.

Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department, took place in 2018 and 2019. The project was carried out, under tender, by an experienced team of wildlife biologists and hare researchers from Queens University, Belfast. The aim of this project was to estimate the current mean population density and the national total population of the Irish Hare and to examine variation in its population across space and time (principally since the previous Hare Survey of Ireland in 2006\/07).<\/p><p>The full report of the survey is published in an Irish Wildlife Manual on the NPWS website here: www.npws.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/pdf\/IWM113.pdf<\/p><p>The survey involved deploying static wildlife cameras in 44 x 1km survey squares. These squares were selected throughout Ireland to be statistically representative of the country&rsquo;s overall habitat composition. Multiple cameras were deployed within each of the 44 survey squares. Hares were detected in 85% of survey squares. As these 44 squares were statistically representative of the national landscape as a whole this allowed the researchers to extrapolate their findings to the whole country. <\/p><p>There are approximately 70,000 x 1km squares in Ireland and 85% occupancy of these indicates that the hare has a very widespread distribution. The researchers&rsquo; extrapolations were further underpinned by habitat modelling which suggested that virtually every 10 km square in Ireland contains suitable habitat for the species and should be included within its Favourable Reference Range. <\/p><p>The inclusion of citizen science records in the survey was designed to further inform the distribution model for the species. The 1,421 Irish Hare records that were submitted by the public through the National Biodiversity Data Centre supported the results of the camera trap surveys, i.e. that the Irish hare is very widespread in Ireland. These records were not used, however, in the population model which was solely based on the standardised sampling of the camera trap survey.<\/p><p>Using the camera trap data, methods were developed to estimate the distance of each hare detected on camera, enabling the use of distance sampling analysis. Distance sampling is a statistical package developed specifically to estimate the densities of wild animals. <\/p><p>Mean Irish Hare density during winter 2018\/19 was estimated at 3.19 hares per km<sup>2<\/sup>(95% confidence intervals: 1.59&ndash;6.43) with highest and very comparable densities in the northwest (3.50 hares\/km<sup>2<\/sup>) and southwest (3.46 hares\/km<sup>2<\/sup>) regions and lowest density in the east (2.66 hares\/km<sup>2<\/sup>). <\/p><p>The average estimate was 4.5% lower than the 3.33 hares\/km<sup>2<\/sup>estimated during 2006 and 58% lower than the 7.44 hares\/km<sup>2<\/sup>estimated during 2007. Nevertheless, such was the width of the 95% confidence intervals that the current density estimate cannot be said to be significantly lower than the previous survey. It should also be noted that hares are known to show significant, natural inter-annual fluctuations in population (as demonstrated by the 2006\/2007 data).<\/p><p>The mean density estimate from this latest national survey was comparable to the 20 year mean density from all surveys since 2000 of approximately 3 hares\/km<sup>2<\/sup>. This suggests that the population remains stable. The national Irish Hare population was estimated at 223,000 individual hares during 2018\/19 (with a 95% probability that the number is between 111,000 and 449,000).

In particular, these require that naval vessels visiting Irish ports do not carry nuclear weapons and do not engage in military exercises.<\/p><p>In this instance, permission was requested earlier this month for the Royal Navy survey ship, HMS Enterprise, to pay a routine visit to Cork from the 12th to the 18th of June. Permission was granted on the basis of the conditions that I have already outlined, i.e. that the vessel not engage in any military exercises or naval manoeuvres or carry nuclear weapons.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Nevertheless, it is customary for the crew of a naval vessel to be armed, including when paying a visit to a foreign port. The Firearms Act 1925 as amended provides a specific exemption to the requirement to have a firearms certificate where the possession of a firearm is on board a ship as part of the equipment of the ship.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Security arrangements for such visits are ultimately a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with whom my Department consults before granting permission for a ship to visit.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of neutrality is characterised by non-membership of military alliances and means that we do not participate in common or mutual defence arrangements.In this context, port visits like that of the HMS Enterprise are not indicative of anything other than our desire for friendly relations with our neighbours and our desire for the Irish Naval Service to be equipped to communicate with other navies where necessary.\u00a0<\/p><p>On this occasion, the Irish Naval Service also availed of this opportunity to engage in a joint communication exercise with the British vessel in question outside Irish territorial waters.<\/p><p>I would note that the Irish Naval Service itself regularly visits foreign ports in precisely the same manner, including ports in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800079#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport

Approximately 60 percent of Ireland&rsquo;s total assistance is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the balance administered through other Departments, primarily the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been increasing its ODA allocations to Humanitarian assistance and Climate Change. The Humanitarian budget was &euro;107 million in 2021. Including allocations in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the food crisis in the Horn of Africa, the 2022 allocation for humanitarian action is currently &euro;126 million.

The Annual Report serves as a core accountability and transparency tool, providing a comprehensive overview of expenditure under the aid programme, and demonstrates the results that have been achieved.

I travelled to Belfast for meetings with the political parties on 11 May. I also spoke with the leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson in the period immediately following the election. Furthermore, the Taoiseach travelled to Belfast on 20 May to meet with political parties and business leaders.

","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1062,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 454 and 542 together.<\/p>  <p>It is deeply disappointing that the British Government has chosen to unilaterally introduce its 'Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill', and has in so doing moved away from the process agreed in the Stormont House Agreement, a process that was agreed by both Governments, political parties and victims and survivors groups. <\/p>  <p>  We have profound concerns both on the substance of this Bill and the process of its drafting and introduction, and we are conscious that it has been strongly opposed by victims, by the Northern Ireland parties, and by civil society groups. I know that many families are upset by the publication and progress of this Bill, including those waiting for inquests or pursuing civil litigation. There will be many that understandably feel that immunity, conditional or otherwise, may be more about protecting perpetrators instead of pursuing justice and getting to the truth in such cases.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We also have serious questions with regard to the Bill's compliance with international human rights obligations, and in particular, as to whether the Bill complies with the positive obligation on states to carry out effective investigations into unlawful deaths required by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p>  <p>  The Council of Europe Committee of Ministers brought forward their examination of the McKerr Group of legacy cases at Ireland's request in light of the introduction of the Bill. The examination took place on 9 June. Ireland delivered a national statement during the debate, expressing serious concerns and questions with regard to the compatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights. It is now expected that the UK will have to answer a series of questions on the legislation from the Secretariat, namely to explain how the Bill is convention compliant, and how it will gain public trust, ahead of a further discussion in Strasbourg in September.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The right of individual application is at the core of the system established by the European Convention on Human Rights.\u00a0It is not generally the role of the European Court of Human Rights to examine the compatibility of a state&rsquo;s domestic laws with the Convention in the abstract.\u00a0\u00a0Rather, the Court examines whether the application of a state&rsquo;s domestic laws gives rise to a violation of the Convention in a given case, in light of the relevant factual circumstances.\u00a0In doing so the Court will normally have the benefit of the evidence before the domestic courts as the impact of the state&rsquo;s domestic laws on the Convention rights of the individual concerned.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any future examination by the Court as to whether this Bill, if enacted, is compatible with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s obligations under the Convention will necessarily turn on the factual circumstances of a given case.\u00a0In order to do so,\u00a0 it must be in a position to assess its practical impact on the conduct of an inquest, prosecution, civil action, or police complaint, and whether this gives rise to a violation of the Convention in a given case.<\/p>  <p>  In this light, discussion concerning the possibility of the referral of an inter-state case to the Court by Ireland concerning the Bill is, in the Government&rsquo;s assessment, premature.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that since the entry into force of the Convention in 1953, there have been just over 30 such inter-state cases. The vast majority of inter-state cases before the Court arise from regional conflicts between contracting states.\u00a0 Ireland has only exercised the right to refer an inter-state case to the Court on one occasion previously (Ireland v United Kingdom (1972)). That case concerned practices which in the Government&rsquo;s view amounted to torture, in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, and was taken against the background of the exercise by the United Kingdom of wide-ranging extrajudicial powers of arrest, detention, and internment in Northern Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As such, the case of Ireland v United Kingdom is illustrative of the grave and exceptional circumstances in which the Government will consider exercising its right to refer an inter-state case to the Court.<\/p>  <p>  However, the\u00a0Government has consistently been and remains fully committed to engaging with victims and families,\u00a0with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the British Government to strongly advocate for a collective approach to legacy which is based the legitimate needs of victims and that, crucially, must meet its human rights obligations. We do not believe that the Bill in its current form meets those important tests. We will also continue to engage proactively with the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on this issue and in support of families. Ireland&rsquo;s current role as President of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe represents a timely opportunity to ensure that concerns regarding the compatibility of the Bill with the Convention are satisfactorily addressed by the British Government.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800086#WRV02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1063,"content":"<p>Question No. 455 answered with Question No. 305.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1064,"content":"<p>Question No. 456 answered with Question No. 356.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1065,"content":"<p>Question No. 457 answered with Question No. 356.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1066,"content":"<p>Question No. 458 answered with Question No. 356.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1067,"content":"<p>Question No. 459 answered with Question No. 303.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1068,"content":"<p>Question No. 460 answered with Question No. 305.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1070,"content":"<p>Question No. 461 answered with Question No. 305.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1071,"content":"<p>Question No. 462 answered with Question No. 305.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1072,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800087#WRW00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1073,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[34234\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800087#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of a passport application (details supplied) given that it has exceeded the target issue date and the applicants' travel date is imminent;

to fast track the development, production, and access to COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines - for all.\u00a0The initiative has brought together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, philanthropists and global health institutions. The ACT-Accelerator has four intervention areas:\u00a0vaccine development and sharing; testing; therapeutics; and health system strengthening. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the ACT-Accelerator has been via COVAX, the vaccine pillar. Our total funding commitment to-date is &euro;13.5 million, all of which has been disbursed. Ireland&rsquo;s funding has been earmarked for dose procurement by low and lower middle income countries; the transport of doses donated by Ireland; and support for in-country delivery systems. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to financing for COVAX, Ireland has committed to donate up to 5 million doses from our supply chain, largely through the COVAX facility. Over 2 million of these doses have been delivered so far, the majority to countries in Africa. COVAX has been working steadfastly to facilitate the delivery of additional doses from Ireland and the EU although the chronically weak state of health systems in many low-income countries, and high levels of vaccine hesitancy, makes this a slow and challenging process.\u00a0Nonetheless, COVAX has managed to deliver over 1.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines globally. This is a remarkable achievement in the 18 months since the global vaccination campaign commenced. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s financial and dose donations to COVAX are complemented by a broader response to the COVID-19 pandemic, grounded in our long-term commitment to SDG 3; better health and well-being for all. Our response to the pandemic has been informed by our previous responses to other infectious disease outbreaks, including HIV and AIDS, and Ebola. We know from our work on these issues the critical value of health system strengthening, the need to engage with and involve communities in infectious disease prevention and control, and the importance of sustaining support for pre-existing conditions such as TB and malaria.\u00a0Since the onset of the pandemic, we have contributed more than &euro;100 million per annum to Global Health with a focus on health system strengthening in partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and through the UN system, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and Gavi.\u00a0These pre-existing partnerships have been leveraged to ensure an effective Irish Aid response to the COVID pandemic and inform and complement our support for the ACT-Accelerator, and COVAX in particular. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800090#WRZ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1159,"content":"<p>Question No. 539 answered with Question No. 303.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1160,"content":"<p>Question No. 540 answered with Question No. 305.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1162,"content":"<p>Question No. 541 answered with Question No. 308.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1163,"content":"<p>Question No. 542 answered with Question No. 454.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1164,"content":"<p>Question No. 543 answered with Question No. 305.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1165,"content":"<p>Question No. 544 answered with Question No. 302.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1166,"content":"<p>Question No. 545 answered with Question No. 302.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1167,"content":"<p>Question No. 546 answered with Question No. 302.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1168,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800091#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1169,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[34490\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800091#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of complaints that he has received from persons under the customer service charter for his Department in respect of passport services in the past five years to date in 2022; the number of complaints that he has engaged with the Ombudsman in respect of complaints made by persons regarding the operation of the passport service in the past five years to date in 2022; and if the Ombudsman has directed him to improve service delivery regarding passports in 2022.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1170,"content":"<p>The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0has a formal comments and\u00a0complaints\u00a0procedure in place to allow customers an opportunity to give feedback on the quality of the service they receive.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0is committed to providing a high quality, effective service to all of our customers and welcomes feedback on how the service can be improved.

The Bill requires serious and detailed consideration now.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, at this early stage, to make clear that the full incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, with the ability to obtain remedies for breaches of the Convention in domestic courts, was a fundamental commitment under the Good Friday Agreement, which was implemented by adopting the Human Rights Act. \u00a0The incorporation of the ECHR into Northern Ireland law by way of the Human Rights Act has been essential in creating confidence in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political, policing and judicial structures over the past 24 years.

It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission in its report envisages that should the Defence Forces at some stage in the future move to the highest level of ambition, LOA 3, then very significant enhancement of Air Corps capabilities will be required.  This would include the development of an air combat and intercept capability through the acquisition of a squadron of jet combat aircraft.<\/p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations has been undertaken over the last four months by my Department and the Defence Forces.  This has involved significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials have engaged with key stakeholders to ascertain their views. Following this engagement, I intend to return to Government with a proposed response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan before the summer recess. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800093#WRCC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":1209,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800093#WRCC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1210,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[33970\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800093#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the total number of persons who are employed by his Department; the number who are currently working remotely; and the estimated number of persons in his Department who ordinarily worked from home prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1211,"content":"<p>There are 391 people employed by my Department.

Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7 provides another formal mechanism for members, under Section 114 (1) and 114 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, to seek redress of wrongs or to make a complaint. Complaints may be submitted orally or in writing to the complainants Commanding Officer, or in the case where they feel themselves wronged by their Commanding Officer, may complain to the Chief of Staff. Notifications are sent to my office and the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces formally when any Chapter 2 complaint is submitted and of its subsequent outcome. <\/p>  <p>  Under this mechanism there exists further recourse for the complaint to be referred to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces for investigation and recommendation if appropriate. The  Ombudsman, as the Deputy is aware, is entirely independent in carrying out his functions in line with the provisions of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces Act, 2004, and his final report, which may include a recommendation on each complaint, is submitted to me for determination. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan additionally aims to ensure that a transparent culture exists, that encourages personnel to report inappropriate behaviour, discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. <\/p>  <p>  Despite the reforms that have taken place in recent years however, it is clear from the experiences shared by both current and former members of the Defence Forces that the culture that is pervading, and the application of these policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not, and are not, serving all Defence Forces personnel well.   <\/p>  <p>  This Independent Review is therefore a necessary and critical step to fulfill my duty of care obligation to the men and women of the Defence Forces, to provide a safe work environment.

I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation grant in future budgets.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website,\u00a0www.spu.ie.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware the Department has also issued additional funding to schools to support the implementation of infection prevention and control measures required to help minimise the risk of Covid-19.\u00a0 The Department will continue to work closely with all of the education partners and public health specialists so that schools will be supported in implementing any measures that may be required for the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.<\/p>  <p>  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website\u00a0www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).<\/p>  <p>  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.<\/p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of\u00a0 Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability.\u00a0www.energyineducation.ie.

There are specific plans in place to open both additional special class and special school provision and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next.<\/p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.<\/p><p>My\u00a0Department is committed, in conjunction with\u00a0the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders\u00a0to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for\u00a0students with\u00a0additional needs\u00a0and to\u00a0support all\u00a0students to achieve their potential.<\/p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.<\/p><p>The list\u00a0of special schools is available on the NCSE website at the following link:<\/p> <blockquote> \tncse.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/NCSE-Special-School-Allocations-21-22-website-03-12-2021.pdf. <\/blockquote>  <p>and for special classes\u00a0at:ncse.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Final-2021_2022-Sp-Class-list-25_03_22.pdf.<\/p><p>As the query refers to an individual\u00a0school,\u00a0I will arrange to have it referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800096#WRFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":1392,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800096#WRFF01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Recognition","counter":1391,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800096#WRFF01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1392,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[33807\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800096#WRFF01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of the implementation of the programme for Government commitments for gender recognition.","asker":"1481","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1393,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, contains a number of actions with respect to gender recognition.

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system includes a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods (of up to 20 years) outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them. The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund. The Commission's terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system.<\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021. It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed. The report set out a wide range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years). It recommended that long-term carers should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring. The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory \"Family Carer Register\" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission's Report need to be considered very carefully and holistically. My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.<\/p>  <p>The Expert Group engaged in a widespread programme of stakeholder consultation in order to review the existing funding model for Early Learning and Childcare and develop a new funding model. Over the course of the two year project, the extensive programme of stakeholder consultation engaged with parents, providers, the workforce, and other stakeholders, all of which is documented and publicly available. <\/p>  <p>Core Funding,\u00a0which begins in September,\u00a0is the new funding stream worth &euro;221 million in full year costs\u00a0to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.\u00a0\u00a0Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>My officials have engaged extensively with provider representatives and providers of all types, and continue to do so, via various fora, as the details of Core Funding\u00a0are\u00a0available. For example, on 12th April, senior officials in my Department met with a group of provider representatives to discuss issues regarding Core Funding.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>In addition, on 4th May, I, along with officials, met with a delegation from the\u00a0Federation of Early Childhood Providers (FECP) to discuss their position in relation to the new Core Funding stream following a survey of their members. The FECP shared extremely detailed materials at this meeting, including case studies and extensive data on provider costs. My officials have examined these materials and issued a comprehensive response to the FECP.\u00a0Furthermore, on 22nd of June I met with the FECP at Leinster House to hear their concerns. <\/p>  <p>My Department and I have engaged with providers throughout the development and implementation of the new funding model, and will continue to do so in the future. The next meeting of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum is scheduled for 29th June and this will serve as a useful opportunity to hear from a variety and diversity of stakeholders in the sector. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>Core Funding is a new way of providing funding for the sector and addresses some disparities in the previous system of funding.\u00a0 However, I do not believe that there is a solid foundation in evidence for the concerns expressed by some that Core Funding will compromise services' viability.<\/p>  <p>In examining all of the data available to the Department, including that provided by the FECP following our meeting on 4th May, there is no evidence about a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Analysis of providers&rsquo; income and costs shows that services with the characteristics correlated with ECCE-only provision had the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision. Levels of income in excess of costs range from 14% to 23%, depending on the characteristic chosen. These figures compare to a sector median proportion of income in excess of cost of 4%.\u00a0This was prior to increases in ECCE capitation rates and does not take account of the substantial investment in services during Covid-19 or the new Core Funding income that services will be eligible for.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Accounting\u00a0for the\u00a0proposed Employment Regulation Order rates currently being considered,\u00a0Department estimates show\u00a0that services with ECCE and Core Funding, will receive income from the State that will\u00a0cover the staff costs and leave\u00a0considerable room for overheads and surplus, or\u00a0for any service that may choose to raise wages above anticipated new minimum rates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>Every year a number of services close and others open. Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. This data also shows that services close for a wide range of reasons including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances and only a minority relate to sustainability issues.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>I am\u00a0committed to ensuring more stability of income for services, and that is one of the key objectives of Core Funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and less than 1% of services will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be put\u00a0in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.\u00a0 This will be open to both private and community providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG03050","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":1470,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1471,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[33826\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG03200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the State boards that are under his remit; the details of each State board; the details of all the persons who are currently on each board in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1472,"content":"<p>There are six bodies under the aegis of my Department with State Boards.

Action 9.1, which is led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, aims to raise awareness of the role of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in dealing with complaints of discrimination under the Equal Status Acts and the Employment Equality Acts. Action 9.2, led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in partnership with the Free Legal Aid Centres (FLAC), aims to provide tailored legal advice and advocacy to LGBTI+ people through a specialised legal advice clinic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1489,"qnumday":668,"qnumall":"[34362\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will advise in relation to the situation regarding the Transition Fund (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1490,"content":"<p>In December 2021, Government adopted the 25 recommendations contained in an Expert Group report,\u00a0Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC).<\/p>  <p>  The new funding model will support the delivery of ELC and SAC for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families. To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.<\/p>  <p>  One of my top priorities in Government is to improve affordability of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare for parents. The package of measures I announced in Budget 2022 is designed to ensure that fees to parents do not increase and that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are felt without being absorbed in fee increases.<\/p>  <p>  The Transition Fund starts this process and will be in place between May and August 2022. This is a temporary, once-off scheme, to support providers transition from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) to the new Core Funding Scheme in September.<\/p>  <p>The main contractual requirement for the Transition Fund is that fees remain at or below the\u00a0Registered Fees List that were\u00a0in place on 30th   September 2021\u00a0for the period of the scheme. This requirement will apply to all services who are in contract for the Transition Fund. If, between May and August, a service has not imposed any increases to Registered Fees List that was in place on 30th September 2021 then they are compliant with the terms and conditions of the Transition Fund.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Participation in the Transition Fund\u00a0is optional but I am very pleased that approximately 94% of providers have now signed-up and thereby have agreed to maintain their fees at or below September 2021 rates. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic period, I was\u00a0very concerned to hear of a small number of providers proposing to increase charges to parents at a time when the Government supported early learning and childcare providers very significantly. Fee\u00a0increases that did occur\u00a0during this period are unfortunate. <\/p>  <p>  The name of the\u00a0service to which you refer has\u00a0not been shared so I am unable to comment on specifics.

I am confident that the fee management system, in tandem with developments to the National Childcare Scheme, will together deliver significantly improved affordability for parents.<\/p>  <p>  I would encourage any parent or provider with questions regarding the Transition Fund or fee management to contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee for support and guidance at: myccc.ie\/where-is-my-nearest-ccc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":1491,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1492,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[34382\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will provide advice on a matter (details supplied) in relation to childcare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1493,"content":"<p>I firmly believe that the level of pay for early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners\u00a0should reflect the value of their work for children, for families, for society and the economy. In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, and recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, which began meeting in December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The outcomes of the Joint Labour Committee process will be supported by the new Core Funding stream I announced in Budget 2022 which will provide an additional &euro;73 million of funding in 2022 and is equivalent to more than &euro;221 million in a full year. Core Funding will support providers to meet the obligations of\u00a0\u00a0Employment Regulation Orders that may arise from the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, improving workforce recruitment and retention through improvement in pay and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, last December I launched\u00a0Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028.\u00a0Nurturing Skills\u00a0aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five \"pillars\" comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD, is developing an automatic enrolment retirement savings scheme which will benefit all employees including those working in Early Learning Care and School Age Childcare.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of affordability, significant investment is being made by my Department to address affordability for parents through the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). I announced a number of changes to the Scheme as part of Budget 2022. These changes will be of significant benefit to many parents. <\/p>  <p>  For instance, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours\u00a0so that their children can attend\u00a0after-school services, which will benefit an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. <\/p>  <p>  In September 2022, the NCS Universal subsidy will be extended to all children under 15 years of age, so that all families will get a minimum subsidy of 50cents a hours, which equates to over &euro;1, 100 per annum for a child in full time childcare. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":1494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05500"},{"type":"question","counter":1495,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[34390\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800097#WRGG05600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the status of a payment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1496,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine on February 24, my Department continues to work as part of the whole-of-Government response with a focus on meeting the immediate, temporary accommodation needs of those fleeing the conflict. <\/p><p>My Department is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here.

I will as soon as possible, subject to Government approval, publish the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Hatred or Violence and Hate Crime) Bill to\u00a0legislate against hate crime and hate speech and help ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is leading a number of important initiatives to ensure we better support all victims of crime.

This includes daily monitoring of all recorded Hate Crimes \/ Incidents on PULSE and Social Media, providing Hate Crime training, supporting investigating members, advising investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that in October 2020, an update to the Garda PULSE system introduced a number of measures to improve the reporting and recording of Hate Crimes and Hate Incidents on PULSE. The introduction of a mandatory hate-related tick box with associated discriminatory motives ensure data is recorded accurately. The introduction of the &ldquo;H&rdquo; hate-identifier allows for more efficient recording and analysis of hate-related data e.g. identifying trends, repeat offending and repeat victimisation. This allows for a more victim-focused Garda response. <\/p>  <p>  Discriminatory motives are searchable on the Pulse System which allows for analysis of Hate Crime data specific to victims who were targeted because of their race \/ ethnicity \/ colour etc.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) forms part of the Garda Community Relations Bureau and has a very positive working relationship with minority communities in Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy is externally focused on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s relations with the communities that it serves, delivering on the obligations on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human rights and equality under Irish, EU law and international conventions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to significantly increase reporting of hate crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members of the LGBTI+ community owing to the more open relationship that has been developed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency online hate crime reporting mechanism was launched by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of hate crime.

Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. <\/p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders.

The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1718,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1719,"qnumday":746,"qnumall":"[33563\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that a number of staff (details supplied) at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital have not received the pandemic bonus payment given that their direct counterparts in Beaumont Hospital and Our Lady&rsquo;s Navan did receive the payment; if the HSE plans to rectify this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1720,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Priorities","counter":1721,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1722,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[33603\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the Young Patients Family Fund that was launched by the Scottish government in July 2021; if he will give consideration to developing a similar scheme to support parents with children in hospital in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1723,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that there are no specific proposals within my Department at present for the development of a scheme of financial assistance for parents\u00a0 in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy.\u00a0 However, under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, administered by the Department of Social Protection,\u00a0a person may be eligible to apply for an Exceptional Needs Payment to help meet essential, one-off,\u00a0exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Charges","counter":1724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1725,"qnumday":748,"qnumall":"[33604\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800102#WRMM04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the National Review of Hospital Parking Charges, announced in 2018, will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1726,"content":"<p>I am aware that hospitals\u00a0that charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families, particularly for those with long-term illnesses.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, some hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge and reduced rate parking for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Programme for Government\u00a0makes a commitment to introduce a cap on the maximum daily charge for patients and visitors at all public hospitals, where possible and to introduce flexible passes in all public hospitals for patients and their families.

Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required. This work will also need to be informed by the final Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act, the progress of this Bill &ndash; which passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March &ndash; and associated regulations that will be developed following the enactment of this legislation. My officials are continuing engagement with the HSE in relation to the necessary programmes of work required to further advance consideration of the issues which arise in respect of the commencement of Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care, including the current provision of fertility preservation services for cancer patients.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the other parts of the Deputy&rsquo;s question relate to service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy on these as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800104#WRQQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disease Management","counter":1820,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800104#WRQQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1821,"qnumday":778,"qnumall":"[33775\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022062800104#WRQQ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which cancer patients will be enabled to participate in clinical trials as per the HSE Service Plan 2022;

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April\u00a0the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website:\u00a0www.hse.ie\/eng\/staff\/resources\/hr-circulars\/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE\/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision.

It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE\/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:<\/p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<\/p>  <p>  2.
