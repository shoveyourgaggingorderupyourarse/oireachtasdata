Initiatives such as town and village renewal, LEADER, SICAP and CSP are all supporting the economic and social development of people and communities right across the country, and will continue to do so in 2019.  <\/p><p>I have set out in the table the provisional outturn by programme in respect of Departmental expenditure in 2018. A provisional appropriation account will be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the 31<sup>st<\/sup>March 2018.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aims to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level on international election observation missions. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).<\/p>  <p>  A new roster of volunteer international election observers was put in place in January 2019. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade received 395 applications, allowing a roster of 201 members to be mustered, similar to the number of volunteers mustered under the previous roster.  The level of interest meant that there was intense competition for the available places.  To ensure a fair process, a booklet was made available detailing the elements which applicants were expected to demonstrate in completing their written applications.  Assessment at this stage was subject to independent calibration and quality assurance from an external agency.  <\/p>  <p>  Eight adjudication panels were established, chaired by retired officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, of Ambassadorial rank and who, during their career, had demonstrated extensive experience of human rights, democratisation and the rule of law overseas. <\/p>  <p>  While I am confident that the high level of interest will help ensure the quality of Irish election observers remains high, with nearly twice as many applicants as available places, regrettably not all of those willing to volunteer could be selected. <\/p>  <p>  In the interest of fairness, an appeal mechanism was available.  Less than one fifth of the unsuccessful candidates sought a formal review by way of appeal. On the basis of the grounds submitted by each candidate, about half of the review requests were accepted and referred to an Appeals Panel. That Appeals Panel has yet to finish its deliberations.  <\/p>  <p>  As was made clear to all potential volunteers in the Volunteer Information Booklet which set out the requirements expected, all candidates were required to provide at least one relevant example under each of five competencies, as part of a competency based assessment.  Provided that a candidate with prior international election observation experience, or, indeed, any other relevant experience, demonstrated through the examples provided in their application form that they possessed the competencies under assessment, such experience was fully considered in the marking process. <\/p>  <p>  Although the Volunteer Information Booklet did not specify that particular qualifications were essential or desirable, a small proportion of marks were awarded for the specific skills and experiences which were listed as desirable in the Volunteer Information Booklet. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of any candidate requesting reasonable accommodation for a disability at the time of application, such a request would have been given full and thorough consideration. No candidate requested any particular arrangement at the time of applying, and no candidate contacted the Department at any stage of the process prior to the appeals stage to ask whether particular arrangements could be made. The Appeals Panel cannot consider new information which was not provided at the time of application, to do so would not be fair to all candidates in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300063#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Staff","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300063#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[3322\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300063#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of regular grade civil servants his Department has hired in advance of a no-deal Brexit; the number of specialist grade civil servants hired in advance of same; the budget made available in advance of Brexit for hiring of staff in advance of the UK withdrawal from the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>Managing the response to Brexit has impacted on the work of many units in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\u00a0and its missions overseas and staffing levels have been augmented in response.<\/p>  <p>  Global Ireland 2025 will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality.

Each Centre receives significant Government funding through the Emigrant Support Programme each year for its work, including its support for vulnerable Irish and the undocumented.

Association and Meat Industry Ireland, as well as the main provider of insurance for the mart sector in Ireland.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Also, I am aware that my colleague, the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance and Chair of the CIWG, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., met with representatives from the Marts Committee of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society (ICOS) in March 2018, subsequent to the Report&rsquo;s release. \u00a0I understand that the ICOS agreed at this meeting that health and safety was one of the key considerations for insurers when assessing risk and that there was a level of responsibility by mart owners in this regard.\u00a0 I have also been advised that mart owners generally have been reassessing practices on foot of previous experiences of claims submitted against marts and, accordingly, implementing relevant improvements in management practices and standards of facilities in order to seek to avoid such situations arising again.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the most recent quarterly update on implementation was published on 12 November 2018 and shows that of the 19 actions from the Report on the Employer and Liability Insurance with deadlines up to and including Q3 2018, 18 have been completed.\u00a0 I would like to assure the Deputy that the CIWG Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Motor Report.\u00a0 I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo;

In my time as Minister for Finance, I have received two requests seeking my approval to transfer\u00a0a banking business.

Upon review of the proposals, and consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank on the relevant regulatory, supervisory and prudential considerations, I gave my approval to both bank transfers. <\/p><p>A key consideration when reviewing proposals to transfer banking business is that in promoting the industry\u00a0it is important that there is fair entry to and exit from the financial services sector in Ireland, and the\u00a0Government has\u00a0no\u00a0desire to cause undue difficulty to firms wishing to enter or withdraw from the market.\u00a0Moreover, we recognise that mergers and acquisitions play an important role in the growth of firms, and transfers of banking business often take\u00a0place in\u00a0such a context. Also, as banks with a global footprint enter the\u00a0Irish market using branch or subsidiary structures, when there is a restructuring at group level, it may be necessary for the bank to transfer its business internally from one part of the group to another.\u00a0This is particularly the case in light of Brexit, where the Irish authorised bank may be a branch of the group's UK bank and transfers its Irish business to become a branch of another European bank within the group structure. <\/p><p>It\u00a0is not in the spirit of the legislation to prohibit any transfer of banking business, unless there were serious concerns about the\u00a0regulatory or prudential impact of a proposed transfer, or it would be likely to have a significant\u00a0negative\u00a0impact on the Irish economy or financial stability.<\/p><p><b>Statutory Instruments made under Section 33 of the Central Bank Act 1971 (as amended)<\/b><\/p><p>1.

The proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the increasing environmental conditionality attaching to such payments. These proposals are complex and we are now in the middle of intensive and challenging negotiations for the next CAP 2021-27.  <\/p>  <p>  Consideration of the CAP proposals is ongoing at EU level.  Since the legislative proposals were launched in June 2018 a total of 25 Working Group meetings have taken place under the Austrian Presidency.    The proposals are also discussed at the Special Committee of Agriculture meetings on a regular basis.  In addition, CAP post 2020 is also a standing agenda item at every Agri-Fish Council meeting where I have discussed the CAP proposals extensively with my Agriculture Ministerial colleagues.  <\/p>  <p>  The Romanian Presidency outlined an equally intensive programme of Working Group meetings to discuss specific aspects of the CAP proposals for the duration of their Presidency.  I will have a further opportunity to discuss the proposals at the upcoming Agri-Fish Council on Monday 28 January.  <\/p>  <p>  I have always sought to have a broad consultation on these proposals.  In February 2018, I launched my Department's public consultation process which included six meetings with stakeholders across the country.  In addition, I hosted a Conference in July 2018 on the new CAP legislative proposals for interested stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. The outcome from the consultation process and the stakeholder conference is feeding into the Department&rsquo;s on-going analysis and policy response to the proposals.  <\/p>  <p>  This was a timely opportunity to bring all interested stakeholders together for a constructive discussion on the future CAP. The range of speakers came from the political sphere, from the European Commission, and from my Department.  The conference was a very useful opportunity to hear the views of the many stakeholders involved.<\/p>  <p>  Since then there have been ongoing informal consultations with stakeholders, including farm bodies, state agencies and the environmental pillar. The new delivery model requires Member States to submit their draft CAP Strategic Plan to the Commission for approval before the deadline of 1 January 2020 covering Pillar I and Pillar II expenditure.   The CAP Strategic Plan will allow Member States the flexibility to design measures that are best suited to their own strategic needs within parameters laid down in Council Regulations.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working towards the 1 January 2020 deadline. The process of developing the draft Cap Strategic Plan will be a complex process, involving a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SWOT) analysis, a needs assessment, scheme design, ex ante evaluation including a Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment.  The establishment of a Monitoring Committee including representatives from the key stakeholders, relevant Government Departments and agencies and the EU Commission is a requirement under the current draft proposals. The Committee will oversee progress on the implementation of schemes in the current Rural Development Programme (RDP)  and will continue to have a role in the next programming period.<\/p>  <p>  I am open to working with the new delivery model and welcome the move to a more strategic performance based approach.  This new framework must be based on system which provides simplification for all. The new CAP proposals will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.  The negotiations for the CAP post 2020 are still ongoing and I will continue to seek to secure the best possible outcome for the Irish agri-food sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300069#WRJ05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300069#WRJ05600"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[3278\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300069#WRJ05700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if lands designated as habitats are eligible for GLAS; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>All land farmed that is designated as habitat under the Birds or Habitats Directives\u00a0and all commonage land is not only eligible for GLAS but\u00a0was afforded priority access to the scheme.\u00a0The GLAS terms and conditions and detailed specifications\u00a0outline the criteria that must be met in order for land to be eligible for the action.<\/p><p>The scheme is now fully subscribed and closed to new applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300069#WRJ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Staff","counter":502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300070#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":503,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[3313\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300070#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of regular grade civil servants his Department has hired in advance of a no-deal Brexit; the number of specialist grade civil servants hired in advance of same; the budget made available in advance of Brexit for hiring of staff in advance of the UK withdrawal from the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":504,"content":"<p>My Department is participating very actively in the Whole-of-Government approach to preparedness and contingency planning for Brexit. My officials are working closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies across the public service to develop a joint approach in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on products coming from the UK. In July 2018, and again in September 2018, a number of decisions were made at Cabinet relating to Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, including the phased recruitment of staff, as required. The Government has already sanctioned in the region of &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process for the recruitment of additional staff to carry out increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit.<\/p>  <p>   The aforementioned requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. The Department has carried out an extensive analysis exercise, based on examination of trade and container movement data, together with close consultation with stakeholder organisations and individual companies, to establish as best we can the likely volumes of controls that will need to be carried out. This has been a difficult exercise, given the lack of detailed data as a result of the UK&rsquo;s participation in the Single Market up to this point, but we have based our assumptions and planning on what we believe are reasonable estimates of the likely volumes.<\/p>  <p>   On staffing, we have used this data analysis exercise to guide our planning in relation to putting in place the staff that will be required to carry out the range of controls needed. These controls are carried out by a combination of portal inspectorate staff and where necessary, the appropriate veterinary and technical supervision, as well as administrative staff not located at the ports. The Department is working very effectively with Customs and others to provide the resources needed to apply the necessary controls.  <\/p>  <p>   In general, the Department will look to recruit and redeploy as well as engage temporary flexible solutions where appropriate and as necessary. Veterinary supervision will be provided with respect to products of animal origin by a combination of: veterinary inspectors currently on recruitment panels,  where we are in the process of engaging with 37 remaining on current panels; new recruitment competitions; redeployment within the department on a temporary basis if necessary and the possible engagement of contracted service arrangements as required.<\/p>  <p>   The Department is also drawing from a pool of applicants for Portal Inspector posts and from redeployed volunteers from within the Department to conduct some of the necessary checks. Candidates for these roles will be interviewed in February to provide capacity in Dublin Port and Rosslare for the engagement of 70 Clerical Portal Inspectors, and a significant pool of additional applicants is available for interview as needed.<\/p>  <p>   The Department can also draw from a pool of applicants for Technical Agricultural Officers for plant health checks. The Department continue to engage with PAS re the aforementioned options as well as other required grades such as Assistant Agricultural Officers as well as back up administrative staff in traditional administrative civil service grades.<\/p>  <p>   Overall, I am confident that the state will be in a position to deliver the services required in terms of both imports and exports at the appropriate time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300070#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Aid","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300070#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[3351\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300070#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there are loans available to farmers that are required to upgrade farm buildings to comply with the regulations of his Department (details supplied).","asker":"1318","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>One of my priorities is to improve access to finance for the agri-food sector.

As Minister for Communications, Climate Action, &amp;amp; Environment, I continue to oversee intensification of preparedness and contingency planning for the wide portfolio under my remit.   Last month the Government published a Contingency Action Plan, setting out its approach to dealing with a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit. This is the culmination of many months of work. The Action Plan outlines the Government&rsquo;s assessment of the challenges and the measures considered essential to limit the damage of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; exit and to put in place measures to manage that exit as best as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and the EU remain committed to securing a negotiated outcome. We are now less than 70 days away from the UK withdrawal from the EU. Contingency preparations for a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; outcome are therefore intensifying as the risk of a disorderly Brexit increases, posing unique and unprecedented challenges. This work continues both at a national and EU level and further information on no deal preparedness will follow in in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s overall objectives have been consistent from the start &ndash; seeking to minimise the impact on trade and the economy, protecting the peace process including avoiding a hard border, maintaining the Common Travel Area and reinforcing commitment to and participation in the EU. These objectives continue to guide our approach, regardless of the type of Brexit which emerges. <\/p>  <p>  All resourcing of Brexit preparations, staffing and other costs relating to Brexit activities in my Department are met by existing budgets. Potential impact on a particular sector will depend largely on the shape of the future relationship between the EU and UK.

The National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, restates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.<\/p><p>During this transition, gas has the potential to deliver significant and sustained benefits, particularly in terms of enhanced security of supply.

As part of this commitment will be the transfer of those out of rent supplement with long term housing needs to HAP\u00a0with a targeted completion date of these transfers by the end of 2020. \u00a0For 2019, HAP&rsquo;s transfer activity is expected to yield a closing rent supplement base of approximately 15,000 rent supplement customers at year end\u00a0<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement:<\/b><\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement:\u00a0 Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure 2011\u00a0 - 2019<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><th>Cost &euro;000<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>96,803<\/td><td>502,747<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>87,684<\/td><td>422,536<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>79,788<\/td><td>372,909<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>71,533<\/td><td>338,208<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>61,247<\/td><td>311,059<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>48,041<\/td><td>275,294<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>34,378<\/td><td>230,566<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>24,303<\/td><td>179,500\u00a0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2019<\/td><td>15,000<\/td><td>132,395\u00a0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300072#WRM04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Staff","counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300072#WRM04300"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[3320\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300072#WRM04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of regular grade civil servants her Department has hired in advance of a no-deal Brexit; the number of specialist grade civil servants hired in advance of same; the budget made available in advance of Brexit for hiring of staff in advance of the UK withdrawal from the EU; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":666,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s EU and International section (including Irish-UK Relations) has responsibility for the Department&rsquo;s response to Brexit.\u00a0 As part of the Department&rsquo;s planning for dealing with the UK&rsquo;s departure the team was expanded by \u00a0two senior managers who led the programme of work necessary to ensure that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area, are safeguarded and maintained.\u00a0 There are currently 11 staff (11 FTE) assigned to this section. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this staff cohort, working with other colleagues in the legal and policy divisions of the Department, is sufficient to complete all of the arrangements necessary to maintain the reciprocity of welfare rights and entitlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300072#WRM04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Benefit Applications","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300072#WRM04600"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[3361\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019012300072#WRM04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>Carer's benefit (CARB) is a PRSI based payment, made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to a person who has such a disability that they require that level of care.\u00a0 <\/p><p>An increased payment can be made where full-time care is being provided to two people.<\/p><p>An application for CARB was received from the person concerned on 14 November 2018 in respect of two care recipients.
