While the economy is performing well with strong employment and unemployment now down to 4.4%, we cannot be complacent. In the past we took success for granted and failed to prepare for emerging challenges, trends and opportunities. To achieve this, we must ensure our economy is well positioned to adapt to a low-carbon future and a revolution in digitalisation and automation. <\/p>  <p>  We must tackle lower productivity levels in indigenous firms as the best way to achieve sustainable wage growth. We are known now for our strong talent pool but we must ensure our skills evolve as the economy changes. And we need to increase labour market participation. <\/p>  <p>  Growing the indigenous enterprise sector and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are both key to Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic recovery.   Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results for 2018 show there were 215,207 people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies in 2018, the highest total employment in the history of the agency and exports also reached a new record of &euro;23.8 billion.  <\/p>  <p>  It is my priority to see more jobs created in the regions.  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) is a competitive fund complementary to the Regional Enterprise Plans. In 2017 and 2018, I announced funding for 42 projects as part of Calls 1 and 2 of the REDF worth a total of almost &euro;60m, with projects supported in every region.  I announced a Third REDF call earlier this week with a fund of &euro;45m to deliver on our ambitions in Future Jobs Ireland and to build Brexit resilience in the regions. <\/p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are located in every county and provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector. The LEOs act as the &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business. I increased funding for the LEOs by 22% in 2019 and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and to build resilience against Brexit.  The LEOs are supporting over 36,000 jobs in 7,000 small Irish businesses and significantly in 2018 171 LEO clients were transferred to Enterprise Ireland for further growth and investment.  Future Jobs Ireland has a commitment to examine how best to further strengthen the capacity of the LEOs. <\/p>  <p>  I also recently announced the second call of the pilot Online Retail Scheme which has been open for applications since 19 June 2019 from Irish owned retail businesses with a physical retail outlet. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Data","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[26952\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of new first-time investments by new IDA client companies in County Donegal in 2019; the number of visits by new IDA client companies in 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>Attracting investment and creating new jobs in regional locations &ndash; including County Donegal &ndash; is a major priority for both myself and my Department.  In February 2019 I launched a new Regional Enterprise for the North-West to support enterprise growth and job creation through collaborative initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  The IDA has a significant role to play in helping us achieve that objective and the Agency&rsquo;s staff have been working hard to increase regional investment. The relevant statistics reflect the emphasis that has been placed on this objective. There are now, for example, over 132,000 people employed across more than 680 IDA client firms outside of Dublin. 58% of total IDA client employment is located outside Dublin. The IDA has also recently reported a very strong first half of 2019 with 140 investments secured and 13,500 jobs approved so far this year.  <\/p>  <p>  Donegal, along with many other parts of the country, has benefitted from the IDA's strong regional focus. The County has experienced a 60% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2012, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 2,223 in 2012 to 3,564 at the end of last year. In 2018 alone, the total of IDA supported jobs in Donegal increased by 5%, with the County now home to 12 IDA companies including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica. <\/p>  <p>  With respect to site visits, Donegal hosted one visit over the first three months of this year. In 2018, the County hosted eight site visits, a fourfold increase compared to two site visits that took place in 2017 and the highest number in over a decade.<\/p>  <p>  The Agency and its staff continue to do their utmost, including through site visits, to encourage overseas companies to locate in regional areas. The Board of the IDA also, in fact, recently held its June meeting in Letterkenny.  I understand that during its two day visit to the County, the Board had excellent engagement with IDA client companies located in Donegal and held detailed discussions on increasing investment to both that County and the Border region in general.<\/p>  <p>  While there have been no new name investments in County Donegal so far in 2019, it's important to emphasise that FDI performance is not accurately measured by the number of new-name investors, given Donegal&rsquo;s strong performance over the last decade. Indeed, the IDA&rsquo;s experience, over many decades, has shown that the growth of existing overseas firms here can produce as many jobs &ndash; if not more &ndash; than new name investors. It is also important to recognise the success of out investment in indigenous companies.  With respect to Enterprise Ireland, (EI), that Agency's clients in Donegal employed 3,818 people in 2018, an increase of 12% over the previous year.  In the period from 2016-2018, EI provided funding of &euro;3.6 million to client companies in the county to support them to innovate, improve competitiveness and to diversify their global footprint. <\/p>  <p>  With respect to 2019, the indications are that FDI in Donegal will continue to increase. For example, Abbott Laboratories announced plans last July to expand its workforce in the County with the creation of 500 new jobs. The IDA is focused on attracting further such high-quality investment to Donegal and it continues to promote the County to investors considering investing in Ireland for the first time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Funding","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[27101\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of call 2 of the disruptive technologies fund; her plans for holding an information event on the fund in County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The &euro;500 million Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF) was established as part of the National Development Plan (NDP) under Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The DTIF is being delivered through my Department and its enterprise agencies, with a resource allocation of &euro;500 million over the period 2018-2027.

Enterprise Ireland (EI), has approved funding to enable community groups throughout the country to develop the entrepreneurial talent in their area and support innovative business ideas to create jobs. <\/p>  <p>  In 2016 Enterprise Ireland awarded &euro;3 million to 32 projects under the Community Enterprise Fund. The goal of this initiative was to stimulate and support enterprise and job creation throughout the country at local, community and regional level.<\/p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are located throughout the country and provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector. The LEOs act as the &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business.  The Government agreed to increase funding for the LEOs by 22% in 2019 and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and to build resilience against Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs are supporting over 36,000 jobs in 7,000 small Irish businesses and significantly in 2018 171 LEO clients were transferred to Enterprise Ireland for further growth and investment.  Future Jobs Ireland has a commitment to examine how best to strengthen the capacity of the LEOs to work with and support a broader range of ambitious and growth-oriented enterprises to improve productivity growth, innovation and resilience.<\/p>  <p>   It is my priority as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to see more jobs created in the regions.  Regional development is a key priority for this Government and it is important that the value of collaboration and the work by the development agencies, which has yielded strong jobs results in recent years, must be complimented by a bottom-up approach in providing critical business supports and advice.    <\/p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) is a competitive fund introduced by my Department in 2017 with the overarching aim of driving enterprise development and job creation in each region throughout Ireland. The REDF has been an effective instrument of policy particularly as a complement to the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017\/8 where it has served as an enabler for projects emerging from that regional collaborative process. <\/p>  <p>  To date, 42 projects have been awarded funding over two completed Calls worth a total of almost &euro;60m, with collaborative projects supported in every region. <\/p>  <p>  On Monday 24th June, I launched the new &euro;45M Regional Enterprise Development Fund, which again will be administered by Enterprise Ireland.  Applications for funding are invited through the public call for submission of projects that was announced this week in the National and Regional Press. <\/p>  <p>  My focus is to work with Enterprise Ireland in support of organisations that come forward with good projects to boost enterprise and job creation in their regions. So I would urge private and public organisations from across the country to apply. <\/p>  <p>  REDF 3 aims to build on the success of the REDF funding to date, and there is an opportunity to further align the Fund with recent key policy developments including: The Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020; Future Jobs Ireland; and the new Enterprise Ireland Regional Strategy. Key themes emerging from these policy initiatives will be a key focus of the REDF under Call 3 and future calls. <\/p>  <p>  The REDF also now sits alongside and is complementary to the new funding opportunities under Project Ireland 2040 (the Rural and Urban Regeneration and Development Funds; Climate Action; and Disruptive Technologies) which collectively constitute an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen the regional enterprise ecosystem throughout Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Data","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[26975\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the most recent occasion on which the IDA visited counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath; the number of new jobs created by the IDA in the past 12 months; the steps it is taking to attract companies to the counties; the success it has had with the strategy for the counties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>Regional development, not just in the Border area but across Ireland, remains a key priority of mine as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Together with my Department and its enterprise Agencies, I am focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, 56% of all net new jobs created by IDA Ireland were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history.    <\/p>  <p>  The strength of the IDA's recent mid-year results for 2019 indicates that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in the regions so attractive in the first place with the technology, financial services and pharmaceutical sectors performing extremely well.  While more work certainly remains to be done, the Border region has benefitted from the IDA's regional focus. The area experienced a 3% growth in employment by overseas companies in 2018 and we are working hard to increase this figure in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  As part of their work in growing investment in the regions, the IDA is directly investing in a building programme to help ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding outside our major cities. As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;10 million to the Agency for the next phase of its Regional Property Programme (RPP). The RPP includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. As the Deputy will be aware, I announced the appointment of a design and delivery team for this Unit earlier this year with construction due to commence later this year. The wider Border region will also benefit from the RPP, with new buildings planned for Dundalk and Sligo, which I am confident will help generate new opportunities for surrounding areas. <\/p>  <p>  The IDA is taking other steps to promote the region to investors. For example, the Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East\/North West Region and an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to promote the area, it is focusing on sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The Agency's staff regularly engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. County Meath, meanwhile, is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.<\/p>  <p>  While there were no new foreign direct investment (FDI) supported jobs created in Cavan in 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase in FDI employment, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County.  Similarly, Meath saw a 4.5% increase in IDA supported employment, with the creation of 67 new jobs last year. <\/p>  <p>  Information on site visit data for 2019 is only yet available for the first three months of this year. Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath each hosted one site visit over that period. In 2018, County Meath reported a twofold annual increase in site visits with six visits. County Cavan hosted two site visits, whilst there were three site visits to County Monaghan, compared to one visit in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI, of course, only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. Both Monaghan and Cavan have seen promising growth in the numbers employed in Enterprise Ireland-backed firms, with increases of 5% and 6% respectively. County Meath has seen a 4% increase in EI-backed businesses. The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also performing well, with net increases of 146 jobs, 134 jobs and 143 jobs in LEO-supported companies in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath respectively in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Another example of the success of this Government's strategy for regional job creation is Combilift's new &euro;50 million Research &amp;amp; Development and Testing Centre in County Monaghan. This new investment will create 200 jobs and represents a home-grown success story. The positive impact that Combilift has on the county and the border area cannot be underestimated.  Under my Department's Regional Enterprise Development Fund, I was pleased to allocate funding for a number of projects in the three counties including the Boyne Valley Food Hub in Meath, the Bioeconomy Research Centre in Monaghan and Cavan Digital Hub.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that all of the Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create more jobs and source new investments in 2019 for Cavan, Monaghan and Meath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[26926\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she has had recent meetings with the European Commissioner for Competition regarding threats posed to Irish businesses by Brexit and mitigation measures that the EU can provide in such circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>I most recently met with Margrethe Vestager, EU Commissioner for Competition on 24 January 2019 in my Department.

While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. <\/p>  <p>  Brexit is my top priority at this time and was central to my decision-making on the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2m Current and &euro;65m Capital funding I secured as part of Budget 2019. <\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5 million capital funding has been allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, which represents an increase of 22%, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTradeIreland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have also allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment.  Additional resources have been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises as they adjust to the new relationship with the UK and pursue new opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland [ITI] works with SMEs on an all-island basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit.  As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness-raising events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.  To date, more than 7,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. <\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Planning Voucher scheme, which enables businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services.  Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each.  Businesses are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report, there have been 1,587 applications for the Brexit Planning Voucher, of which 1,391 have been approved. <\/p>  <p>  In March, ITI launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit Implementation voucher, which offers financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50% towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business, including businesses in the border counties.  The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. So far, 641 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.  As of February 2019, the LEOs are also offering customs training workshops to support businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help businesses prepare for Brexit.  Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. As of June 2019, 602 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradeable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  During February and March this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, which build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. The new Plans will ensure that regional stakeholders continue to work together to help achieve the Government&rsquo;s 2020 targets for regional employment taking account of new and emerging opportunities and challenges, including Brexit. Implementation of the Regional Enterprise Plans for the North East and the North West has already commenced. Earlier this week on 24th June I launched my Department's new Regional Enterprise Development Fund Call 3 for &euro;45m in competitive funding which has a strong emphasis on building resilience in our enterprise base in the context of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Dublin aside, the most recent quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 21 June, there have been 656 eligibility applications received, of which 596 have been approved and 144 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;31.73 million. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for eligibility applications in April 2019.  This scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Over 5,000 businesses have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 199 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved.  258 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Customs Insights course helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes. The course advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available.  This course is available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. <\/p>  <p>  In order to help build enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.  This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. On 24 June, at a visit to the recently opened Cavan Digital Hub, I announced that I will be making a further &euro;45 million available under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have participated in the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit, including events in Monaghan and Donegal. In addition to these events, Enterprise Ireland has rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country, including events in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Cootehill. <\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the lasting uncertainty around the Brexit process may be leading businesses to defer their Brexit preparations.

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. <\/p>  <p>  For example, I provided an additional &euro;5m to the network of Local Enterprise Offices, &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland, &euro;2m to IDA Ireland and &euro;1m to InterTradeIreland to help businesses prepare for Brexit, together with funding for the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme and the IDA Regional Property Programme.  I also provided extra staff for regulatory bodies of my Department to ensure they are properly resourced to address the additional demands that Brexit will create.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, 641 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 602 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 468 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training.<\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 3,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  <\/p>  <p>  ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. <\/p>  <p>  ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,587 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 1,391 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000\/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.<\/p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched in March of 2018, provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  As at 21 June, there have been 656 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 596 have been approved to date by SBCI. 144 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;31.73 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years. This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17th April and up to 21st June it received 365 eligibility applications and issued 340 eligibility letters.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Over 5,300 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 199 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 258 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. <\/p>  <p>  EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,250 Customs Insights Course participants.<\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.  The existing supports, schemes and advice are in place to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[27103\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of Future Jobs Ireland 2019 further to its launch; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1268","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>On 10 March 2019, I, along with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, launched<i>Future Jobs Ireland 2019: Preparing Now for Tomorrow's Economy<\/i>.<\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland 2019 is the first in a series of annual reports as part of a new multi-annual framework to ensure our enterprises and workers are resilient and prepared for future challenges and opportunities.

The Deliverables outlined in Future Jobs Ireland 2019 represent the first steps in achieving these Ambitions and will be built on in subsequent annual editions.<\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is a Government priority and will be overseen by a Cabinet committee (Cabinet Committee A) which will have a standing agenda item regarding Future Jobs Ireland.

More discrete metrics and targets have also been established for each deliverable. Each deliverable will have an agreed delivery date of Quarter 1, 2, 3 or 4. Many deliverables involve collaboration between departments, so a lead department is assigned ownership for reporting and coordinating contributors. Partnering contributors are identified along with the leading Department.<\/p><p>Progress on deliverables will be reported quarterly to the Senior Official Group through the Department of the Taoiseach, assisted by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure an ongoing whole-of-government focus on delivery.

Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions is a key policy priority of this Government.<\/p>  <p>  We want to create a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 18,600 more people are in employment in the Midlands in Q1 2019 compared to Q1 2015 when the Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative was launched. Unemployment in the region has reduced from 14.9 percent to 6.2 percent in the same period. The State average figure at Q1 2019 is 4.8% and so unemployment in the Midlands is currently outside that 2020 target.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 per cent in each region by the end of 2020 and to bring and\/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average. <\/p>  <p>  To that end, during February and March this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, which build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. I am pleased to say that implementation has commenced in all regions. <\/p>  <p>  I launched the Regional Enterprise Plan for the Midlands region, which covers Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath on 6 February in Mountmellick, Co Laois. The Steering Committee for the Plan, chaired by Dr. Anne Cusack, has already met to commence its implementation. <\/p>  <p>  There are seven &lsquo;Strategic Objectives&rsquo; in the Midlands Plan. These include: ensuring that the Midlands is well positioned to address the challenges posed by the transition to a low carbon economy and renewable energy; position and support the growth of the Midlands as an advanced manufacturing centre of excellence; strengthen the attractiveness of the Midlands as a destination to visit; and ensure the availability of skills and talent to realise the Midlands&rsquo; economic potential and address upskilling requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Objectives and actions in the Midlands Plan are set out alongside the Enterprise Agencies&rsquo; (Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland) and the LEOs&rsquo; core activities in the region. Earlier this week, I launched Enterprise Ireland's new regional plan 'Powering the Regions' which sets out the focus of its activities in each region, including the Midlands, to expand the reach of the Enterprise Ireland client base over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The focus for the Midlands over the period to 2020 under the Regional Enterprise Plan will be to maintain an emphasis on employment growth, aiming to out-perform the rate of growth achieved since 2015 to date, reduce unemployment to within one percentage point of the national average, and ensure that sustainable, quality jobs are created and maintained in the region. The collaborative Strategic Objectives and actions in this Plan will support this. Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plan, and with all stakeholders working together, including those in Longford and Westmeath, the Midlands region is well positioned to realise its enterprise potential and see better quality, sustainable jobs and investment in the region. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development, and both Longford and Westmeath have attracted funding through these. They include my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund; and the Rural and Urban Regeneration and Development Funds under Project Ireland 2040. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), the Midlands region has already secured total funding of over &euro;3.4 million under two completed Calls, including the IMR in Mullingar (&euro;2.16m) and the development of a Digital Hub in Longford in a joint project with Leitrim and Cavan (&euro;1.28m). Earlier this week I launched a Third Call under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund for up to &euro;45 million and I encourage strong collaborative proposals from the Midlands to apply to the Scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications Data","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA05200"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[26951\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA05300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applications received to date in 2019 for work permits for chefs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[26950\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA05400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the average time it takes to process an application for a work permit; the number of applications received in 2018; the number refused and granted; her plans to streamline the process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[26957\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA05500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applications for employment permits received in each month to date in 2019; if the applications are from trusted partners or standard; the number of reviews carried out in each month for both categories; the numbers approved and refused each month; the waiting list for processing applications; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 31 and 35 together.<\/p><p>As the economy improves and we approach full employment my Department has experienced a high volume of employment permit applications which has led to delays in processing applications.

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to raise awareness and, where appropriate, to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. <\/p><p>My Department and I have been active in the promotion of these schemes through participation in different campaigns, including the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. In addition to these, Enterprise Ireland has also rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country to better understand their exposure to Brexit and the mitigating actions available to them.<\/p><p>This campaign also includes a Government of Ireland website, gov.ie\/Brexit, which outlines the likely impacts of Brexit on businesses in Ireland, information on how to mitigate those impacts, and a calendar of upcoming Brexit-related events for businesses.  <\/p><p>The network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) is a first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable businesses to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. So far, 641 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.  As of February 2019, the LEOs are offering customs training workshops to support businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<\/p><p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which operates the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme, continues to actively promote these schemes, both at its own events and through participation in other Brexit-related events. The SBCI also launched its first awareness campaign on its YouTube channel and since its publication the BLS explainer video has been seen more than 371,000 times. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign. This portal also features an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and an online customs training tool aimed at businesses dealing with customs for the first time.<\/p><p>InterTradeIreland works with SMEs on an all-island basis and is particularly well placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. The ITI Brexit Advisory Service serves as a focal point for SMEs working to navigate the changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness raising events focused on providing knowledge of customs procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 7,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.<\/p><p>ITI also offers a Brexit Planning Voucher scheme, which enables businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas, such as tariffs, currency management and customs issues. The scheme and the Brexit advisory service have been publicised through a campaign including promotion at Brexit-related events and through national radio. <\/p><p>My Department has also produced a number of leaflets and booklets outlining the different Government supports available to Irish businesses. Among these is the &quot;Quick Brexit Guide for Business&quot;, which includes information on the range of Brexit supports available to businesses, their eligibility criteria and how to access them.

With 13,500 job approvals and 140 investments secured so far this year, these results indicate that Ireland remains highly attractive to overseas firms. The technology, financial services and pharmaceutical sectors have all performed particularly well.<\/p>  <p>  The provisional results for the first six months of this year have also reflected a number of significant investments for the regions including 150 jobs by Meissner in Castlebar, 100 new positions at JRI America in Tralee and 75 new jobs at Greenfield Global in Portlaoise. We have now seen 455 projects secured for the regions since the IDA&rsquo;s current five-year strategy was launched in 2015. This is a testament to the focus IDA Ireland has placed on regional development and the whole of government action to enhance our regional offering.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of further updates, my Department and the IDA will announce the Agency's annual results in January 2020. This will give us a more complete picture of Ireland's FDI performance in 2019.   <\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, I am encouraged by the continued strength of Ireland&rsquo;s FDI offering. We are now, for example, ranked seventh amongst the world&rsquo;s most competitive economies and second in the Eurozone. Our pro-enterprise policy environment, track record as a home to global firms and talented workforce are also powerful arguments for investing here. <\/p>  <p>  While we are confident about what we have to offer, the Government is never complacent. Global competition remains intense and we need to continue evolving and adapting if we want to retain our status as a world-leader in FDI. <\/p>  <p>  One key challenge is responding to increasing automation and the development of artificial intelligence. These developments have the potential to, over time, fundamentally change employment models and the way we currently work. Our country&rsquo;s small size and rich talent pool, however, means we have the flexibility and skillset to successfully adapt and become a genuine 21st century economy. The Government has also taken steps, most notably through our adoption of the &ldquo;Future Jobs&rdquo; strategy, to ensure we are collectively ready for the jobs and opportunities of the future. The IDA&rsquo;s new strategy will be another key contribution to that process. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of further inward investment, I want to stress that, when it comes to FDI, I have no bigger priority than increasing levels of investment to Ireland's regions. The IDA shares that approach. We are doing everything we can to encourage investors to locate in regional areas. This includes marketing potential investment sites outside of our main cities and working to develop recognised industry clusters that will help to attract overseas investors to areas outside of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA06700"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[26924\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA06800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the uptake of the competitive start fund for female entrepreneurs; the amount allocated under the fund in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>Female founders have traditionally been under-represented in the start-up arena, something that Enterprise Ireland (EI) is committed to change.

The first Plan &lsquo;Good for Business, Good for the Community&rsquo; was published in 2014 and aimed to raise awareness of the benefits of CSR to business and all stakeholders in society. The second plan, Towards Responsible Business&rsquo; Ireland&rsquo;s National Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility 2017-2020, wants to ensure that businesses, in particular SMEs, understand the economic and social benefits that CSR can bring to businesses, large and small.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan aims, over three years, to position Ireland as a &lsquo;Centre of Excellence for responsible and sustainable business practice through the adoption of best practice in CSR&rsquo; four dimensions - Workplace, Marketplace, Environment and Community. Businesses and organisations that embed CSR at the heart of their business planning can improve their competitiveness, sustainability, attract and retain talent, whilst fostering social cohesion and protecting the environment. <\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the Plan is driven by the CSR Stakeholder Forum. Its membership comprises of representatives of the business sector, Government Departments and agencies and the wider community and it is chaired by Catherine Heaney, MD DHR Communications. As a voluntary business led Forum, the primary focus of the CSR Stakeholder Forum is to; raise awareness of CSR for businesses and organisations operating in Ireland today; facilitate information exchange; and encourage best practice peer learning opportunities; in accordance with current Government policy objectives. The Forum meets three times a year. Minutes from the meetings are published on csrhub.ie.  My Department provides secretariat to the Forum and actively drives awareness of CSR through dedicated communications channels including csrhub.ie.<\/p>  <p>  An annual progress update - CSR Check, prepared by my Department in conjunction with the CSR Stakeholder Forum, is produced on an annual basis. It was first produced in June 2018 along with the first CSR CEO\/Leaders Breakfast event. Over 100 leaders from across Government, business and public sectors came together at the meeting. The second CEO\/Leaders&rsquo; Breakfast is scheduled for 27th June 2019.<\/p>  <p>  CSR activities within business range across, employee initiatives such as volunteering, to initiatives that seek to reduce business impact on the environment. Not of this activity is measurable and\/or is difficult to measure. The CSR Forum commissioned baseline research on CSR in Ireland, published on the Department&rsquo;s CSR website csrhub.ie. It indicated that the majority of businesses (80% of a sample of 1,300) regarded CSR as &ldquo;very important&rdquo; or &ldquo;moderately important&rdquo;. The survey highlighted a challenge for smaller companies engaging with workplace CSR. Growing the amount of quantitative and qualitative analysis of CSR activity in businesses and other organisations in Ireland will continue to be a key objective of the CSR Stakeholder Forum.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to what the CSR Forum itself can potentially monitor in terms of progress, a tangible indicator of business engagement with CSR in Ireland is reflected in the roll-out of the Business Working Responsibly Mark by Business in the Community Ireland (BITCI). BITCI, a CSR Forum member, launched the &lsquo;Mark&rsquo; in 2010 - the first certified standard for sustainability and CSR in Ireland. It is audited by the National Standard Authority of Ireland\/NSAI and based on ISO 26000.  It is a three-stage process; 1) questionnaire, 2) evaluation and 3) audit by the NSAI. Currently, 33 companies in Ireland have the Mark. Once achieved it is valid for three years.  The cost is borne by the business. <\/p>  <p>  Elsewhere, the European Union (Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by certain large undertakings and groups) Regulations 2017(SI No 360 of 2017) were signed into Irish law on 30 July 2017 and came into operation on 21 August 2017. The Regulations, which transpose EU Directive 2014\/95\/EU, require certain specified large companies such as banks, insurance undertakings and listed companies with more than 500 employees to annually disclose certain company information of a non-financial nature. That information includes environmental matters, social and employee related issues, respect for human rights and bribery and corruption matters. The Regulations also require large listed companies to report annually on the diversity policy applied in respect of the board of directors. Failure to comply with this requirement to disclose non-financial information is an offence and any person found guilty is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or to both. This is the responsibility of my agency, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  Across Government there are related policy initiatives which have measurable outputs and targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals National Implementation Plan 2018-2020, which provides a whole-of-government approach to implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs provide an important framework for businesses and organisations engaging with CSR. In addition, the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, launched in June 2019, outlines the current state of play across key sectors including Electricity, Transport, Built Environment, Industry and Agriculture and charts a course towards ambitious decarbonisation targets. The Plan sets out 180 actions and will be will be monitored and annually updated, with actions reported on quarterly.  In addition, a Climate Action Delivery Board will be established within the Department of An Taoiseach which will hold each Department and public body accountable for the delivery of actions set out in the Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700048#WRA07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Data","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":80,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[27295\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has offered financial or regulatory assistance to a company (details supplied); and if assistance has been sanctioned due to the possibility of such a vehicle being used by the Defence Forces.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":81,"content":"<p>I am advised that no financial or regulatory assistance has been offered to a company the details of which have been supplied by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Expenditure","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[27379\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the breakdown of costs to his Department of the visit of the President of the United States of America, Mr. Donald Trump; the cost of dispatching the L&Eacute; Niamh to Doughmore Bay and the L&Eacute; Aoife to the Shannon Estuary; the transportation and other associated costs involved in sending members of the Defence Forces to County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":84,"content":"<p>The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for the internal security of the State.

The credit is progressively withdrawn once income exceeds this threshold limit by &euro;1 for every additional &euro;2 of income earned so that a home carer earning between &euro;7,200 and &euro;10,200 may be entitled to a partial credit and no credit at all available once income exceeds &euro;10,200.<\/p>  <p>  In such circumstances, as per subsection (8), the family has the choice of claiming the more beneficial of either the Home Carer Credit or the &lsquo;increased standard rate band for two-income couples&rsquo; which they are entitled to as two earners are each in receipt of income.   Revenue will automatically apply the most beneficial option for the family.<\/p>  <p>  This option arises because of the interaction between the home carer credit and the standard rate cut off point for one income couples, as once the primary earner&rsquo;s income exceeds around &euro;37,000 the net benefit of the credit begins to reduce, until the primary earner&rsquo;s income reaches &euro;44,600 and the benefit of the home carer credit additional income threshold is exhausted.  If the family&rsquo;s income is over this amount, it is less beneficial for the couple to claim the Home Carer Credit than the increased rate band for dual income couples which they are entitled to as both spouses are in receipt of income. <\/p>  <p>  The question of choosing between the Home Carer Credit and the increased rate band is therefore relevant only where the primary earner&rsquo;s income is high enough to fully use the maximum available rate band (that is, &euro;44,300) and therefore the home carer&rsquo;s income limit is of specific benefit to lower-income families with dual incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners Audits","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[27280\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of revenue audits undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners in each of the years since 2016; the amount of additional tax liability, interest and penalties notified by way of assessment to the taxpayer as a result; the amount of extra tax, interest and penalties collected by profession, trade and sector in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":96,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that its intervention options range from light touch Aspect Queries through to Investigations for cases of suspected serious tax and duty evasion.

Members of the Working Group have reviewed the materials published by the organisations responsible for its issuance, and will scrutinise any additional announcements that may be issued in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to highlight that unlike bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the announced intention for this particular cryptocurrency is for it to be backed by short term government bonds and a basket of fiat currencies issued by central banks. Given these traits, this particular type of cryptocurrency is often referred to as a &lsquo;stablecoin&rsquo; to reflect the expectation that collateral will be put in reserve to underpin what is issued to purchasers.<\/p>  <p>  The impact that the stablecoin in question may have on the Euro or monetary policy is largely unknown at this early stage, and its effect will largely depend on its ability to achieve a high rate of adoption. Furthermore, stablecoins will need to offer sufficient levels of security, speed and efficiency if they are to impact upon more traditional payments networks, which are themselves continually improving and innovating. <\/p>  <p>  The protection of consumers and the security of citizens is of critical importance. The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) (Amendment) Bill 2019 is designed to give effect to the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD). This Directive includes provisions that virtual currency exchanges, and custodian wallet providers, will be required to meet the standards expected of regulated firms.<\/p>  <p>  As a further indication of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to consumer protection, the intra-departmental Working Group has already engaged with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) to assist in the publication of guidance in relation to cryptocurrencies.

Indeed in the context of the current economic uncertainty, I will be mindful of the policy advice provided by the IMF, European Commission, OECD, as well as IFAC in that we must adopt an appropriate budgetary stance in preparing Budget 2020.    <\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Deputy&rsquo;s question about &lsquo;financial buffers&rsquo; for Department Votes, I recognise that a key challenge we face in terms of policy formulation, is ensuring that Departments manage expenditure each year within the allocations voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. In this regard, measures are in place to ensure that our expenditure and budgetary targets are being achieved on an ongoing basis.    <\/p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Government Minister and Department. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters. There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and expenditure profiles are published for each month. The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored throughout the year and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific recommendation in IFAC&rsquo;s FAR, I would first note that from a fiscal sustainability perspective, the surge in corporation tax receipts and their highly concentrated nature, highlights the risks of permanently increasing public expenditure or financing reductions in taxation on the basis of potentially transient receipts.    <\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the risks associated with the concentration of these revenues. That is why:<\/p>  <p>  - We are setting aside some of the historically high levels of corporation tax for the purpose of creating the Rainy Day Fund. Accordingly, a contribution of &euro;500 million to the fund is currently budgeted for in 2019; and<\/p>  <p>  - Our fiscal policy seeks to continue to broaden the tax base &ndash; measures which included the introduction of USC, local property tax, the increased VAT rate on tourism, and sugar tax. For 2019 these are projected to raise revenues equivalent to approximately 1.5 per cent of GDP or 5.8 per cent of overall general government revenue.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a scoping paper will shortly be published, with a number of policy options put forward as to how this specific fiscal risk could potentially be reduced. Some potential solutions are also presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate these vulnerabilities. It is my intention to give consideration to these &ndash; and possibly other suggestions &ndash; with a view to making recommendations to Government in the Autumn.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that as a result of a longstanding Government policy, we are prioritising the reduction of debt, which in the event of any potential shocks to our tax base, would enhance our fiscal capacity to deal with such an occurrence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":106,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[27320\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700049#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the scheme and tax breaks under the back to work enterprise allowance relative to the qualifications or requirements for an exemption from income tax for two years to a maximum of &euro;40,000; the number of applicants that applied for the tax exemption; the number approved for the maximum exemption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>In the form in which it is presented, the Deputy's question refers to two separate schemes, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BWEA) scheme and the Start Your Own Business (SYOB) tax incentive scheme; however both share the common objective of encouraging enterprise by individuals.  <\/p><p>The former is operated under the auspices of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

This OECD mission was organised in the broader context of the work underway in the European Union for developing a single set of harmonised accrual-based accounting standards.<\/p>  <p>  Despite having recognised strengths, the Irish financial reporting framework is not fully aligned with the OECD Recommendation on Budgetary Governance, which advises that countries present a comprehensive account of public finances. Compared to other OECD countries, in Ireland, information on government assets and liabilities is very limited; time lags for publishing reports are among the longest in the OECD; and institutional coverage of the accounts is particularly narrow.<\/p>  <p>  The OECD report notes that accrual data would be a &ldquo;building block&rdquo; for richer, more reliable fiscal information, which would help Ireland formulate improved assumptions for fiscal forecasts to be better equipped to identify fiscal risks. In this context it is also important to preserve and maintain the cash-based presentation of budgetary information with which stakeholders in Ireland are familiar.   <\/p>  <p>  The OECD identify financial reporting as one of the foundations of good fiscal management. High quality financial reports are essential to ensure that the government&rsquo;s fiscal decisions are based on the most up to date and accurate understanding of its financial position. Financial reports are a mechanism to hold governments accountable for their financial performance and a critical source of information for stakeholders to understand the government&rsquo;s financial operations and their implications for economic decisions.    <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Management Shared Service (FMSS) project and the Civil Service Renewal Plan offer timely opportunities for moving forward the central Government accounting and financial reporting modernisation agenda. The FMSS is a modern IT system to facilitate effective financial management and it is designed to support the introduction of accrual accounting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700050#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700050#WRC00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Apprenticeship Programmes","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700050#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[27417\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700050#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the timetable for the actions in respect of apprenticeships that will be taken to implement recommendations as set out in the report, The Role of Apprenticeships and Work Permits in Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Needs, which was compiled by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.","asker":"1229","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>I welcome the Committee&rsquo;s report in relation to the apprenticeship area and I will be considering the recommendations.

A new streamlined system for processing Safe Country of Origin (SCO) cases has been implemented and various process improvements have been made in the IPO and in the International Protection Appeals Tribunal (IPAT). In addition, further changes have been made by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) to reduce the time taken for the issue of final decision letters.  <\/p>  <p>  Reviews of processes in the IPO have been undertaken in consultation with the UNHCR to streamline processes as much as possible.   <\/p>  <p>  These measures being carried out by the IPO are reflected in the increases in productivity in processing cases. For example 3,091 recommendations were made by the IPO in 2018, an increase of 59% over the 2017 output of 1,938 recommendations.  It is my Department&rsquo;s aim to reduce waiting times for recommendations at the first instance stage with the IPO to 9 months by the end of 2019 subject to the levels of new applications, etc.  The current waiting time for first instance recommendations to issue by the IPO since the International Protection Act 2015 was commenced is 15 months and for priority cases 10 months. <\/p>  <p>  At the appeals stage, in 2018 1,714 appeals were scheduled for hearing, an increase of 181% when compared to the number of hearings scheduled in the previous year. The average processing time for appeals to the IPAT in 2019 is 23 weeks. The IPAT have a target median waiting time of 14 weeks for appeals by the end of 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these measures being taken by my Department it should be noted that there are factors outside of the control of the processing areas that can add significantly to processing time. These include the time taken by applicants to complete their application questionnaire and the need to strike a balance between fairness to the applicant and a recognition that it must be returned within a reasonable period.  In addition, protection applicants have the right to seek redress in the courts.  Finally, future demand cannot be predicted with often very large variations in numbers of applicants from one year to another. The need for specialised training of staff means a significant lead time before new staff can be fully operational which presents significant challenges to reducing waiting times. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700052#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700052#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[27297\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700052#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to legislate to enhance the safety of communities following serious crimes and anti-social behaviour at many locations to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>There is a wide range of legislation in place to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour in all of its forms.<\/p><p>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994<b><\/b>contains a range of provisions aimed at dealing with breaches of public order.

For children, the possible interventions range from a warning from a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.

The oversight tasks in respect of statutory auditors are: <\/p><p>- the approval of accountants to act as statutory auditors and public registration; <\/p><p>- the adoption of standards on professional ethics, internal quality control of audit firms and auditing;  <\/p><p>- continuing education of auditors;  <\/p><p>- quality assurance of audits; and <\/p><p>- investigation and administrative disciplinary systems.  <\/p><p>Five of the prescribed accountancy bodies are recognised by IAASA for the purposes of carrying out oversight tasks of the approval and registration of statutory auditors and audit firms; continuing education; quality assurance systems; investigative and administrative disciplinary systems in respect of statutory auditors and audit firms. These are the recognised accountancy bodies.<\/p><p>Under the Audit Regulation, IAASA has direct responsibility for the quality assurance of audits of public-interest entities.

This information is then used to develop Departmental policies and whole-of-government strategies that will help Irish companies to overcome obstacles and avail of opportunities in domestic and international markets.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet the challenges businesses are facing now. Launched on 10 March 2019, it includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. For example, Future Jobs Ireland commits to doubling our lifelong learning rate by 2025. It commits to investing in test beds, demonstrator sites and research and innovation centres in cutting edge technologies like Connected Autonomous Vehicles, advanced manufacturing and Cobotics. It commits to a national AI strategy which will ensure we are leader in exploiting AI technologies in our research centres, businesses and the public sector to secure greater levels of productivity and wellbeing. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland also aims to make the Public Service a leader in technology adoption and innovation including in GovTech,  healthcare and in the edelivery of services to the public. Future Jobs Ireland is an inclusive plan. We don&rsquo;t want any group of people to be left behind so we will also prepare and equip vulnerable workers for changes in their jobs through Transition Teams. We will also enable older workers, women and people with disabilities to participate in the workforce through better childcare, more flexible working options and access to upskilling. <\/p>  <p>  It is vital that all businesses assess their vulnerabilities with regard to Brexit, and other economic challenges that may arise. It is particularly important that businesses examine their supply chains in detail and work towards addressing any identified weaknesses.  <\/p>  <p>   My Department, through its agencies, provide a wide range of supports to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.  <\/p>  <p>   Enterprise Ireland's (EI) Strategy 2017-2020 aims to support entrepreneurs and bigger and better Irish companies to create 60,000 new jobs, to increase exports by &euro;5bn (while reducing dependence on the UK) and to double client spend on innovation over four years.<\/p>  <p>   EI is playing a key role in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation's strategic response to Brexit. Over the medium term, EI's strategy of supporting companies that can compete globally through scaling, innovation and market diversification is the sustainable response to Brexit and other global challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports available to help companies prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer, Market Discovery Fund, Online Customs Training and the Act On Consultancy Grant.  <\/p>  <p>  EI clients' exports for 2018 rose for a ninth consecutive year, and now stand at &euro;23.8 billion, the highest level in the history of the State.  This represents a 6% increase on 2017, and a &euro;10.9 billion increase in exports since 2009. In relation to employment, as of the end of 2018 215,207 people are now employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies. This is the highest in the history of the agency.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland manages the development of the 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) throughout the country.  The LEOs are the \"first stop shop\" for advice on starting and growing a business locally.  In 2018, 8,007 new jobs (gross) and 3,656 jobs (net) were created by LEO-backed client companies, with jobs growth across every LEO area.  At the end of 2018 there were 36,666 people employed by 7,164 small businesses and start-ups that had received financial assistance from the Local Enterprise Offices.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) recently launched their customs training offering which is available to all companies.  Furthermore, they have a number of enterprise supports in place cover a range of potential Brexit impacts.  These include: liquidity support through short term and longer-term loans; restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties, including an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Scheme to deal with sudden shocks; and an expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to work with their client companies and prospective clients to promote Ireland as an excellent location to do business. FDI companies have a hugely positive effect on the local economy with over eight jobs being created for every 10 jobs in an FDI company. Direct employment of 229,057 along with indirect employment of 183,246 translates to 412,303 jobs supported by FDI in Ireland at the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2017, DBEI launched the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).  The REDF is a &euro;60m competitive fund complementary to the Regional Enterprise plans and with the overarching aim of driving enterprise development and job creation in each region throughout Ireland. The Fund is administered for DBEI by Enterprise Ireland and it is aimed at supporting collaborative and innovative projects that can have a significant impact on enterprise development and help to sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.<\/p>  <p>  During 2017 and 2018, 42 projects have been awarded funding as part of Government initiatives under Project Ireland 2040, over two completed Calls for Proposals worth a total of almost &euro;60m, with collaborative projects supported in every region.  A third REDF competitive call was announced last week with a fund of &euro;45m to further align this fund with key policy developments including Future Jobs Ireland and in order to continue to build Brexit resilience in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is nevertheless conscious of our need to continue attracting FDI from as many different countries as possible. In order to reduce over-reliance on a particular market for FDI, we need to build awareness of Ireland as a favoured investment destination in target countries, as well as improve competitiveness and consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and ease of doing business. We are also investing more in infrastructure, to help ensure our economy can support and foster the investment we are seeking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700053#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700053#WRF01500"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[27403\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700053#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to monitor business openings and opportunities arising from Brexit with a view to maximisation of employment here post Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":263,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that in so far as possible, my Department is seeking to maximise opportunities and minimise risks by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post Brexit.

In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan for Brexit so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The UK is the leading exporting destination for Enterprise Ireland supported companies and is the first export destination for many companies.

While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital (1-3 years) to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. As part of the eligibility application process, businesses must complete a business plan demonstrating the means by which they plan to innovate in response to the challenges posed by Brexit.   <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme, which opened to eligibility applications in April of this year, provides a longer-term loan facility of 8-10 years. This &euro;300m scheme is also jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million are available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.     <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established additional supports including a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, an online Brexit SME Scorecard, a Be Prepared grant and a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.  In addition, the Agile Innovation Fund provides grant support of 50% of up to &euro;300,000.  EI has also launched a Customs Insights Online training course aimed at businesses that will be engaging with customs for the first time.   <\/p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Office (LEO) funding has been increased by 22% in 2019, and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating. The suite of supports available from the LEOs includes tailored mentoring to address the specific Brexit challenges facing businesses, as well as targeted training on Brexit-related issues, various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit.  In addition, 641 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit including Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export which are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of the schemes outlined are open to all SMEs, not just agency clients. <\/p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit Advisory Service provides important support for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit.  ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures, and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.  To date, more than 7,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. <\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Planning Voucher worth up to &euro;2,250, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. In March, it launched a Brexit Implementation Voucher, which provides financial support up to &euro;5,625 with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship. InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Tariff Checker allows SMEs to view, filter and print the cross-border tariffs and charges related to their business. This enables businesses to evaluate the potential impacts that Brexit may have on their supply chain.<\/p>  <p>  EU State aid approval has been secured for a &euro;200 million Rescue and Restructure Scheme which can be used to support businesses in the event of a sudden shock.   <\/p>  <p>  Regarding State aid, in November 2017 a Technical Working Group was established comprising representatives from DG Competition, my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  Through the mechanism of the Technical Working Group, Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the State aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.  Options available through the Agriculture Guidelines are also being developed to support large food companies. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I met with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager and at that meeting she assured me that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the continuing uncertainty around the withdrawal process may have led businesses to defer their Brexit preparations.

The unemployment rate is down to 4.4% and there are 2.3 million people employed in Ireland, more than ever before. However, there are several risks facing the Irish economy which may constrain economic performance including infrastructural constraints. We also face risks on the international stage including Brexit, growing trade protectionism and the undermining of the rules-based international trading system which could threaten our future economic welfare.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains a highly competitive economy and performs well in international competitiveness scorecards and is regularly ranked as one of the most competitive economies in the EU. However, this strong competitiveness position cannot be taken for granted. There is no room for complacency which is why improving Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness is a key priority for this Government, and my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is ambitious to build upon the gains we have made in recent years and to ensure our people enjoy higher standards of living and quality of life now, and into the future. Future Jobs Ireland 2019, which was launched on 10 March 2019, is the first part of a new multi-annual framework, up until 2025, to ensure our enterprises and workers are resilient and prepared for future challenges and opportunities. Future Jobs Ireland is an opportunity for managed and sustainable growth aimed at future proofing our economy. This is a whole of Government approach, which will form a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic agenda over the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland focuses on five key Pillars, namely:<\/p>  <p>  1.  Embracing Innovation and technological change;<\/p>  <p>  2.  Improving SME productivity;<\/p>  <p>  3.  Enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent;<\/p>  <p>  4.  Increasing participation in the labour force; and<\/p>  <p>  5.  Transitioning to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland 2019 sets out core ambitions for each of these Pillars, each backed up by a set of specific deliverables representing crucial steps toward achieving each ambition. These deliverables are built on engagement, including through the national Future Jobs Summit held in November 2018 which brought Government and stakeholders together to discuss the Pillars within Future Jobs Ireland. The deliverables for 2019 represent the first stage of Future Jobs Ireland which will be built on in subsequent editions annually.<\/p>  <p>  Future Jobs Ireland is one of a number of Government initiatives designed to embed resilience in the Irish economy and harness opportunities for growth. Project Ireland 2040, the Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Breakdown, Global Ireland 2015, and the National Skills Strategy will all contribute to continued and sustainable growth.<\/p>  <p>  By 2025, our workers and enterprises will be operating in a changed economy. It is time to shift our enterprise and jobs focus to ensure quality jobs that will be resilient into the future. We are witnessing rapid technological advances presenting challenges and also new possibilities. Certain job roles will disappear or be redefined and new job roles will appear requiring new and different skillsets. We want Ireland to be at the frontier of technological developments internationally. To do this we must enable and encourage innovation across sectors and firms. Work must also be done to increase the absorptive capacity and new ways of working across all types of business, and particularly within SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  Technological adoption will mean changes in the labour intensity of important sectors in our economy. As workers transition between occupations and sectors, a greater focus will be required on re-skilling and up-skilling those already at work that are at risk, improving lifelong learning, as well as ensuring graduates are equipped with the skills to contribute in the high technology economy of the future.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of having a skilled workforce cannot be exaggerated. But we also need to inculcate a lifelong learning culture. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), which operates under the aegis of my Department, plays an important role in advising Government on future skills requirements and associated labour market issues that impact on enterprise development and employment growth. It is a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s skills architecture, carrying out strategic research into emerging skills needs and presenting its findings to the National Skills Council (NSC) where priority areas can be identified and addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700053#WRF02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services Provision","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700053#WRF03000"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[27408\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700053#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which adequate incentives remain available to encourage the indigenous sector, with particular reference to job creation enterprises; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>The Government has a new plan - Future Jobs Ireland - to ensure we are preparing now for the jobs of the future.

It is my priority as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to see more jobs created in the regions.  Regional development is a key priority for this Government and it is important that the value of collaboration and the work by the development agencies, which has yielded strong jobs results in recent years, must be complimented by a bottom-up approach in providing critical business supports and advice.    <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s results for 2018 show the progress that the Agency have been making in supporting and driving the creation of new enterprises in the indigenous sector at a national and regional level.  Client companies assisted by Enterprise Ireland created 18,846 jobs in 2018 and 64% of the jobs created were outside Dublin, with all regions recording increases in employment.  There were 215,207 people employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies in 2018, the highest total employment in the history of the agency and exports also reached a new record of &euro;23.8 billion.  Importantly, these EI client firms have extensive links to their local economies around the country and EI client purchases of raw material and services and wages to direct employees exceeded &euro;27 billion in 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland provide funding and other supports with the objective of increasing the potential employment and sales growth of businesses, supporting regional development, increasing the productivity and innovation in indigenous businesses, and increasing exports. <\/p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are located throughout the country and provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector. The LEOs act as the &ldquo;first-stop-shop&rdquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business.  The Government agreed to increase funding for the LEOs by 22% in 2019 and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and to build resilience against Brexit.  The LEOs are supporting over 36,000 jobs in 7,000 small Irish businesses and significantly in 2018 171 LEO clients were transferred to Enterprise Ireland for further growth and investment.  Future Jobs Ireland has a commitment to examine how best to strengthen the capacity of the LEOs to work with and support a broader range of ambitious and growth-oriented enterprises to improve productivity growth, innovation and resilience.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2017 the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) was launched.  The REDF is a &euro;60m competitive fund complementary to the Regional Enterprise plans and with the overarching aim of driving enterprise development and job creation in each region throughout Ireland.

Through the Action Plan for Jobs process led by my Department we have had remarkable success in supporting businesses to create new jobs, with the unemployment rate now down to 4.4% from a high of over 15% in 2012. Of course we face new challenges, not least of which are Brexit and the digital revolution and the Government has a new strategy Future Jobs Ireland to ensure we can sustain the gains to date and build resilience in the enterprise base. <\/p><p>My Department and its agencies consistently engage with businesses throughout the country and across a variety of sectors to ensure an understanding of the existing and potential challenges faced by our businesses. This information is then used to develop Departmental policies and strategies that will help Irish companies to overcome obstacles and avail of opportunities in domestic and international markets.<\/p><p>It is vital that all businesses assess their vulnerabilities with regard to Brexit, and other economic challenges that may arise. It is particularly important that businesses examine their supply chains in detail and work towards addressing any identified weaknesses. <\/p><p>My Department, through its agencies, provide a wide range of supports to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.  <\/p><p>2018 was a very strong year for job creation among Enterprise Ireland (EI) clients with 18,846 new jobs created.  2018 resulted in the highest client employment in the history of the agency, highest net job creation (9,119) in the history of the agency and the lowest number of jobs losses since 1998. 215,207 people are now employed in companies supported by EI. <\/p><p>IDA Ireland created 14,040 net new jobs over the course of 2018, with every region in Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  At the end of 2018 there were 229,057 people working in IDA Ireland client companies, the highest in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s history. This figure surpasses the five-year target of 209,000 which was set in 2015 in IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Winning; Foreign Direct Investment&rdquo; strategy. <\/p><p>Surveys undertaken in 2018, revealed a strong performance by agency client companies in 2018 with, exports amounting to approximately &euro;189bn, up 9.6% from the previous year. These companies spent &euro;24.9bn on payroll, Irish materials and Irish Services and capital expenditure in 2017.<\/p><p>In 2018 the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) saw continued growth in jobs with a total of 8,007 new jobs created and a net job increase of 3,656.

The Committee&rsquo;s role will be to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, has traditionally evaluated the case for commencing a national screening programme against the internationally accepted criteria (collectively known as Wilson Junger criteria). The evidence bar for commencing a screening programme should and must remain high.  This evidence threshold ensures that we can be as confident as we can be that the programme in question is effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards for the population. <\/p>  <p>  Financial cost is but one factor that is considered in the decision making process.

While LULUCF emissions are not currently accounted for in relation to the calculation of compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets in the period to 2020, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets.

On the basis of the information available at the moment, hedgerows could potentially sequester somewhere in the region of 0.1 MtCO2 to 0.5 MtCO2. In order to refine the figures to allow for inclusion in the National GHG Inventory, further remote sensing investigations would be required to create a national detailed inventory of hedgerows.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  <\/p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific or Strategic Improvement Grants for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the recession meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance\/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. <\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take time. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area and it is open to local authorities to fund works on these roads from its own resources.

A significant proportion of this funding has been targeted at families who use community childcare services, thus assisting with the sustainability issues faced by some services. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will further increase investment in childcare and will reduce the top-up many parents have to pay for their childcare. This will have corresponding benefits especially for community providers. The National Childcare Scheme is also expected to increase demand for services, thereby supporting community services to operate efficiently and at full capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme, when introduced in October, will represent a major landmark for children and families in Ireland.  It entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to expand access, improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty. It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  A core design feature of the National Childcare Scheme is that &ldquo;money follows the child&rdquo;. Once a parent has been approved for a subsidy, they should be able to choose any registered childcare provider participating in the scheme, subject to availability, and the subsidy would then be paid directly to that provider. There could be concerns that this could reduce the sustainability of community services by increasing choice of provider. However, the underlying reasons for financial stability problems faced by some community providers do not rest with the nature of the funding model but with a wide range of other factors. Examples of these may include the current inability of some parents to pay the level of fees asked of them, the broader range of family supports provided by some services in disadvantaged communities and the particular business models operated by certain services. By creating a clearer, more flexible and more user-friendly scheme, which explicitly links funding to parental income and to the costs of provision, it is intended that the National Childcare Scheme will offer a vehicle for addressing some of these concerns.   <\/p>  <p>  For services which are facing financial sustainability challenges, my Department oversees an integrated Case Management system operated by Pobal. This Case Management service provides non-financial assistance or support in the first instance. Financial supports are also available for community services facing certain challenges which may also be accessed through Case Management following a financial assessment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has commissioned an independent Sustainability Review to examine the financial situation of a selection of community childcare services in some of the most disadvantaged areas in Ireland, taking account of the future introduction of the National Childcare Scheme.  I expect to receive this analysis very shortly which will inform any necessary refinements or enhancements to the National Childcare Scheme or, indeed, any other policy responses which may be appropriate. In the interim, arrangements are in place to ensure that no one loses out and that families can continue to access their current targeted supports as we transition to the new Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700061#WRO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700062#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[27396\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700062#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the specific sources of statutory funding for NGO services working in the areas of pre-birth, perinatal and early years parenting support to build capacity for positive parenting as envisaged in the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures strategy in view of the stated commitment to early intervention and prevention as outlined in the strategy (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>Under Part 8 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla funds a range of organisations which provide services to vulnerable children and families, including those providing parenting supports.

As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which, arising from these demographic changes alone, are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 4 to 5 years.  <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of this increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age, and so the question of claiming a social protection payment would not arise.  Where this is not possible and a person loses their employment before reaching State pension age, they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. Social Welfare legislation states that jobseeker payments may be made until the person reaches pensionable age.  In this regard, the duration of jobseeker's payments will naturally adjust in line with increases in state pension age into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions, which may be of benefit to the person in the case you have highlighted.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700063#WRQ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Payments","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700063#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[27358\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700063#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when payment in respect of a recently awarded disability allowance will issue in the case a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been awarded disability allowance with effect from 20 March 2019 to 25 June 2019.

A key element is the increased focus by Social Welfare Inspectors on the enforcement of PRSI compliance obligations.  Inspectors nationwide have commenced a campaign of employer inspections and a new unit is being established to focus specifically on the area of false self-employment. <\/p><p>Deliberate misclassification of employment status is an offence with penalties on prosecution of up to three years imprisonment and\/or fines up to &euro;13,000 or twice the amount denied to the Social Insurance Fund as a result of the misclassification, whichever amount is greater. The new unit will ensure that cases of fraudulent misclassification of employment status are prosecuted and that the full force of penalties are applied. To this end, led by my Department, the 2007 Code of Practice on Employment Status will reach the end of a comprehensive revision process next month.  This Code will be a vital tool for employers and employees alike so they can be clear when a worker is genuinely self-employed.  This document will be circulated to ICTU and IBEC for their input before it is published.  In addition, Heads of Bill have already been drafted in order to place the revised Code on a statutory footing later this year. <\/p><p>The question of whether a worker is employed or self-employed is not always a simple one.  The Courts have repeatedly stated that a decision must be made based on the specific facts of each case, having regard to key tests such as the level of control a would-be employer has over the worker and the level of obligation they have towards each other.<\/p><p>My strong view is that this is a far better mechanism than trying to capture in legislation a definition that can never be black and white. <\/p><p>I have instructed my officials to also explore a range of legislative proposals to complement the increased inspection work that will be key to the long term success of this project.  These proposals include anti-penalisation provisions for workers who will be able to take a claim to the WRC if they are victimised by an employer for raising a query regarding their status; and an increase in penalties for employers who deliberately misclassify employees as being self-employed. <\/p><p>Scope Section of my Department undertakes investigations on foot of requests from a variety of sources, for example employees, employers or Social Welfare Inspectors. These investigations cover a variety of situations, for example, modified classes of PRSI for civil and public servants, family employments or insurability of Directors. <\/p><p>Of all the cases referred to Scope, the number involving the mis-classification of an employee as self-employed constitute a small proportion. A breakdown of cases is not available pre 2018 as the historic database in use in Scope did not allow this categorisation. <\/p><p>The following statistics show the number of decisions made involving situations where employment status was misclassified, and the length of time within which the decisions were made:<\/p><p><b>Number of cases in sub-category of Employed \/ Self-Employed (Decision Made) <\/b><\/p><p> <table><tr><th>Decision    made within<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019    (to end May)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Decision    made within<\/td><td>2018<\/td><td>2019    (to end May)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Under 3 months<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3-6 months<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6-12 months<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Over 12 months<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total decisions made<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>59<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I would point out that these cases do not always involve a deliberate \/ fraudulent mis-classification of a worker as self-employed.

More new homes were built in 2018 than in any other year this decade. Indeed in the year to Q1 2019, the Central Statistics Office reports that there were 18,828 new dwelling completions in Ireland, an increase of 25% compared to the previous 12 months. Taking account of new homes completed in Unfinished Housing Developments and vacant homes brought back into use, a total of 22,242 new homes completed available for use in the year to March 2019, 19% up on the previous year. These data, together with other  forward looking indicators, such as planning permissions and commencement notices, provide confidence that this increasing trend will continue and for the target of delivering 25,000 new homes annually by 2020 to be achieved. This shows that Rebuilding Ireland's supply-focused actions, such as streamlined and updated planning arrangements, investments in infrastructure and new apartment development and heights guidelines, are delivering results.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress made, the Government recognises the need to sustain and build on what has been achieved. The National Planning Framework states that between 2018 and 2040, an annual average output of at least 25,000 new homes will need to be provided. To meet projected population and economic growth as well as increased household formation, annual housing output will need to increase to 30,000 to 35,000 homes per annum in the years to 2027. The Government's focus will remain firmly on securing these further increases in supply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700063#WRQ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Funding","counter":694,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700063#WRQ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":263,"qnumall":"[27446\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019062700063#WRQ04400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the grant funding allocated to each local authority for the older persons and disabled persons grant schemes for council-owned homes in each of the years 2016 to 2018, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":696,"content":"<p>My Department provides funding on an annual basis under the Disabled Persons Grants (DPGs) scheme to local authorities for adaptations and extensions to the existing social housing stock to meet the needs of local authority tenants.
