There is already in place a national authority for flood risk management.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, is the lead State body for the co-ordination and implementation of Government policy on the management of flood risk in Ireland.  It is also the national competent authority for implementation of the 2007 EU directive on the assessment and management of flood risk.  In that context and role it carries out and implements a very wide range of measures and programmes aimed at mitigating and minimising the impact of flooding on society, including the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme; the flood relief capital works programme; the minor works scheme; the arterial drainage maintenance programme; hydrometric data gathering and analysis; and various studies and research on hydrology and flooding-related matters.  In carrying out its role and functions it works in very close co-operation with other bodies involved with flooding matters to ensure there is a coherent and co-ordinated approach to flood risk management nationally.<\/p><p>The OPW carries out its flood risk management functions with full statutory underpinning.  The general powers and functions of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, under whose authority the OPW carries out its work, are set out in the State Authorities (Development and Management) Act 1993 and the Commissioners of Public Works (Functions and Powers) Act 1996.  The commissioners exercise their powers and functions under the general consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  They also have extensive specific legislative powers to undertake flood mitigation measures and schemes under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1945 and 1995.  Further regulatory powers are contained in Statutory Instrument No. 122 of 2010 which transposed the EU floods directive into Irish law and which was amended by Statutory Instrument No. 495 of 2015.<\/p><p>In carrying out its lead co-ordinating role in flood risk management the OPW chairs an interdepartmental policy group comprising all of the main Departments and agencies which have policy responsibility for flood-related matters falling outside the direct remit of the OPW such as the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Office of Emergency Planning in respect of a emergency response, local authority liaison and community resilience; the Department of Finance in respect of flood insurance; the Department of Social Protection in respect of humanitarian assistance; the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the National Parks and Wildlife Service in respect of environmental matters; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.  <\/i><\/p><p>The aim and work of the group is to ensure a comprehensive whole-of-government approach is taken to flood risk management and to introduce effective sectoral supports and policy measures in the different areas of responsibility.  The group is finalising an interim report for the Government which it expects to submit shortly.<\/p><p>The OPW's comprehensive CFRAM programme is being carried out also on the basis of close co-ordination with all of the main players and stakeholders in the flood risk management area.  Each CFRAM project has governance structures which require the involvement of all of the relevant local authorities and, where appropriate, for example, in the case of the Shannon CFRAM project, the main agencies such as the ESB, Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries and Bord na M&oacute;na which have functions which may be relevant to flood risk management in the river catchment.  The CFRAM programme is the core strategy for addressing flood risk nationally and the involvement of all of the key players in the development of the flood management plans under the programme will ensure those plans and the measures they include to manage flood risk will take account of and address all of the activities of the various State bodies that may impinge on flooding.  In relation to the River Shannon catchment furthermore, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has established a new Shannon catchment co-ordination group to enhance ongoing co-operation across all of the agencies involved with the river and to oversee implementation of the Shannon catchment flood risk management plan. <\/p><p>The OPW also works closely with local authorities in the implementation of major flood relief schemes in the main urban areas.  The close working relationship and co-ordination of activities between the organisations has ensured the successful completion of major schemes in Clonmel, Mallow, Fermoy, Ennis, Dublin, Kilkenny, Carlow and Waterford.  The OPW has also provided significant funding for local authorities since 2009 to carry out minor flood relief works throughout the country.<\/p><p>It is clear, therefore, that the role of the OPW as the lead national body for the management of flood risk is comprehensive and wide-ranging and involves developing and managing close working relationships with all of the main agencies and bodies in this area.  As with all State bodies, in the context of the Government's public service reform programme, the OPW will continue to review and improve its service, wherever possible.  I am satisfied, however, that its functions, powers, role and responsibilities in flood risk management address all of the main facets of policy and practice across the full spectrum of inter-related activities in this area.  I am also fully satisfied that the OPW is carrying out its role effectively and professionally and that there is no basis for the establishment of a new statutory body for flood risk management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900004#B00300","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1453212300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I think the Minister of State's response justified tabling the question.

As he said, the OPW is the lead State authority for co-ordination and chairs policy committees involving the different bodies involved.  This is useful to know, but it does not have authority to carry out works because all of the other bodies mentioned by him have legal authority in different areas, particularly local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government but also the ESB, Bord F&aacute;ilte, Irish Water, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Waterways Ireland and Met &Eacute;ireann.

Under the regulations the Commissioners of Public Works were appointed as the competent authority under the floods directive for meeting the requirements of the directive.  In that capacity they are required to promote co-ordinated implementation of the directive across river basin districts or other units of management and to work with the competent authorities in Northern Ireland in respect of international river basin districts.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, has already delivered many flood relief schemes under successive Governments, including in Fermoy, Mallow, Clonmel and Bray and on the River Dodder.  The Deputy, however, makes an interesting point about the need to ensure there is better coordination.  That is why we have put in place a new Shannon co-ordination group, the terms of reference of which will be published in the coming days.  It will bring together all of the statutory agencies which have many different roles and functions in respect of electricity supply, navigation and tourism and flood management.  The main point is that the OPW, under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, process, will have 300 areas at risk of flooding mapped and plans to put in place flood mitigation measures.  It is the authority that must deliver them, of which 66 will be in the Shannon river basin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900004#B00500","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453212900,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The system we have in place is not good enough.

The Minister of State should be brave, look forward for the next 50 years or the next two or three generations.

It has to work within the confines of the law.  The OPW must do the same in respect of flood relief measures.  Even in peace times, when there is no flooding, there are issues that fall outside the OPW&rsquo;s policy remit because there will always be a small number of people whose homes cannot be protected.  There may be a need for voluntary home relocation and the Department of Finance or the local authorities to put in place individual property protection schemes.  There is a need for a whole-of-government approach and other agencies and Departments to play their part.  At the end of this month the interdepartmental group on flooding which I chair will send its report to the Cabinet which will make several recommendations.

It was the most significant extension of the Ombudsman's remit in 30 years and a priority objective for me, given that various Ombudsmen had been pressing for the extension for over 20 years.  It brought some 180 additional public bodies, the administrative activities and decision-making of which impact on large numbers of citizens, within the remit of the Ombudsman for the first time.<\/p><p> Previously, the approach taken was to schedule bodies by way of order on a case by case basis.  In the 2012 Act, I adopted the approach of including a general definitional provision of \"reviewable agency\" in the legislation to ensure that any public body that conformed to that definition automatically came within the ambit of the Ombudsman, unless specifically exempted in a Schedule to the legislation.  This new model of an automatic right of review by the Ombudsman was strongly welcomed by the Ombudsman and has led to a substantial strengthening in the rights of the citizen to secure redress.<\/p> <p> As I said at the time, further extension of the remit of the Ombudsman is an ongoing process.  The recent extension of the office's remit to include private nursing homes whose residents are in receipt of public funding or subvention is another example of that.<\/p> <p> A number of proposals and recommendations on the remit, role, status and powers of the Ombudsman have been put forward in recent times.  These include the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to include clinical judgments and the recommendation from the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and the independent working group on improvements to the protection process to extend the Ombudsman's remit to the direct provision system.<\/p> <p> These proposals and recommendations, as well as those put forward by the Deputy, are being examined and considered.  As the process of extension continues, specific issues arise that need to be worked through.  The Deputy will be mindful of the need to ensure the system of Ombudsman review continues to work effectively and of its role within the broader administrative system as a whole.

What assessment has the Minister carried out to look at the scale of this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900016#O00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1453218900,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I reject that there is any bias towards big business.

The aim of the system is to procure open, competitive and non-discriminatory procurement.  Most Deputies in the House who spoke on this issue today indicated that the establishment of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is a breath of fresh air.  It is the first time we have real data and that we know who is buying what and at what cost.  We know the criteria in place.  I have said to people who ask similar questions that of course there is room for improvement.  For example, we are examining the entire procurement process all the time and the tender advisory service will be reviewed next month to ensure that any complaints that have been received will be fully acted on.  As I indicated to the House previously, 27 complaints have been received to date.  Concerns from any small firms will be addressed and real capacity will be given to the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector to ensure it can win public contracts.  Two thirds of public contracts are already won by the SME sector and the overwhelming majority of contracts, in volume and in monetary value, are won by companies within this State.<\/p> <p> That is all good but of course we can do better.  Having a transparent and open State process with which people can interact will be an enormous step forward.  As I stated to other Deputies, I hope to be in a position to bring legislation before the House to establish the OGP on a statutory basis.  We can address these matters in some detail when we look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900016#O00800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453219200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>The Minister knows well there are major problems in this area and the bias, although not specific, comes from the manner in which the contracts are constructed and the reality, as a result, is that small and micro-businesses end up being unfairly disadvantaged.  The proof is that Irish manufacturers which may have previously made uniforms for State services or provided school books and so on - businesses that have operated for decades - are no longer there.  Much of the business has gone to international corporations.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is, frankly, wrong in saying that 66% of public service expenditure is with SMEs.  That is not correct.  The reality is that 97% of Ireland's small businesses have fewer than 40 employees.  The Minister, for the purpose of this issue, counts an SME as a company with up to 250 employees.  That is not a small or a medium-sized business.  There are problems and small and medium-sized businesses have indicated that these relate to the manner in which contracts are constructed.  The idea of saying to companies to get together and pretend they are one big company will not work for companies that naturally compete with each other.  How come other countries can organise contracts to benefit their own types of businesses?  For example, in Germany, all their trains are made by Siemens.  Why is it that we cannot organise our contracts in Ireland to benefit the types of companies that are predominant here, which are small and medium businesses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900017#P00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1453219200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I do not believe we build trains in Ireland.

Under the SME definition, two thirds of the goods and services tendered for are won by SMEs in the State.  We cannot discriminate against larger companies.  If a company in Ireland employs 200 or 250 people, should it be excluded from potentially winning State contracts?  Is there some sort of magic number?  Is it 50, so if a company has 51 employees, it cannot get a State contract?  That would be a ludicrous proposal.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the publication of books.  I looked at what happened before we had the centralised Office of Government Procurement and individual schools were tendering for books.  The same company was supplying the same products to a variety of schools at different costs.

The unacceptable impact on families and children in particular was laid bare in this city and across the country.  The programme was made possible by the bravery and dignity of the three families involved.  There was Erica and her daughter; Sandra and Brendan; and Melissa.  With great courage and dignity, they revealed the depressing and very dangerous nature and reality of homelessness in Ireland, particularly the reality of emergency accommodation in commercial hotels and unacceptable bedsits across the country.  They put a brave human face on the statistics and anybody watching would have been truly shocked by what was revealed in that reality.  It offends any sense of common decency and represents a defining indictment of the Government's neglect and misguided policies on this issue over the past number of years that have allowed this national emergency to develop.<\/p><p>Over the past three years, the Government has been warned repeatedly by all the non-governmental organisations dealing with homelessness, from the Peter McVerry Trust to the Simon Community to Threshold to Focus Ireland, that its policies were wrong and that the crisis was escalating.  In 2012, we were looking at eight new families on average becoming homeless per month.  This increased to 40 families per month in 2014 and between 65 to 75 families per month in the first half of 2015 - about three per day - with nothing being done.<\/p> <p> In 2012, the Government sowed the seeds of this crisis by putting limits on rent supplement.  We saw that last night.  One of the families was driven into homelessness because rent supplement lagged so far behind the market rents.  There has been a explosion of rents in Dublin and throughout the country in recent years.<\/p> <p> The number of vacant houses lying idle is still 3,000.  There is no urgency to get them filled by families who should not be in hotels but in those houses.  At budget time, the Minister for Finance announced that NAMA was going to build 20,000 houses, only 2,000 of which were to be local authority houses.  He should have insisted that 10,000 houses from NAMA would be social houses and instructed NAMA to do so.  NAMA sold a massive number of properties to vulture funds but there is nothing for social housing in its construction plan.<\/p> <p> Did the Taoiseach see the programme?  Is he ashamed of the fact that well over 1,500 children are in emergency accommodation of the type we saw last night in the RTE programme?  Will he change policy on rent supplement, which would be a practical move?  Threshold told the Government that its policy on rent supplement is driving vulnerable families into homelessness.  Will he change that policy?  Will he instruct NAMA to at least implement a 50-50 split and build 10,000 social houses out of the 20,000 it says it will build?  Will he move to eliminate the scandal of local authority houses lying idle while the nation must watch vulnerable families stay in hotel accommodation for well over a year and two years in some cases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900017#P01500","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453219800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for his question.  Obviously, the stories of Emily, Ryan, Preston and Parker are not the kind of stories one wants to see on television or indeed hear about.  The reason for the real problem with housing is the total collapse of the construction sector just a few years ago, which was the most severely impacted sector and which is taking the longest to get back on its feet, as it were.  A total of 123 complaints were received about emergency accommodation.  I understand that all these complaints were dealt with appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  Not for the first time, Deputy Martin mentioned the question of increasing rent supplement.  The real problem is the supply of houses.  Increasing rent supplement would only exacerbate the pressure on the existing housing stock.  I have been through this with Deputy Martin before.  He is aware that under the tenancy-specific agreement, where a landlord pressurises a tenant to leave, the facility exists between the Department of Social Protection and the tenant and landlord to deal with that kind of issue.  A total of 5,800 families were assisted under that scheme in 2015.  A total of 6,000 families were helped by the housing assistance payment, HAP, programme in 2015.  These are people who are under pressure but who are working.  The assistance given to them allowed them to remain in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 300 sites throughout the country are being worked on and are in various stages of construction.  The Deputy is aware that more than &euro;3 billion has been provided by the Government for social housing between now and 2021.  Targets and moneys have been given to every council which have been told to get on with it.  The Deputy is aware of the changes in the regulations issued by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State at the same Department.  A total of 2,000 people were assisted last year, mostly in Dublin, in respect of voided buildings that have been brought back into proper condition for people to live in.  They were more immediate requirements to deal with the existing stock of apartments or houses that needed to be reconstructed.  This is a significant number in itself.  The next stage is for the local authorities who have been given the money, instructions and targets to get on with dealing with the supply of housing.  This is all social housing.  The private sector, NAMA and others will provide housing that will come on the market for those in the private housing sector.  Obviously, the demand is increasing there as well because of the extent of the employment that has been created and that will be created.<\/p>  <p>  I have not seen the programme but I have heard the comments and read the reports about it.  This is not acceptable.  I commend the people who spoke out.  Obviously, they tell their story very clearly but I must say that the actions being taken by the Government in having 5,800 families assisted through the supplementary allowance scheme, 6,000 families helped last year by the housing assistance payment, 300 sites being worked on in various locations throughout the country and 2,000 taken off the housing list last year speak for themselves in respect of the extent of the challenge and how the Government has had to rebuild a construction sector that had collapsed entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900018#Q00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1453219800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>The reason given by the Taoiseach is not the reason.

He would rather have United States style tax cuts for the wealthy than help those in need of a home.

I can honestly say that of all the things that have happened in the past five years, his failure to deal with the housing crisis has been incredible.  It has been an unmitigated disaster all the way through.  It has actually got worse instead of better.

We could have an extra 100,000 houses in Ireland today but if they were not social and affordable houses, we would still have homelessness and we would still have people looking for houses.  Of the 20,000 houses that NAMA is going to built, 18,000 are for the private sector, while 2,000 are for the social housing sector.  That is a nine to one ratio.  The Taoiseach's priority is nine private houses and one social house.  I would argue that the biggest problem of all with housing in Ireland today is the lack of safe local authority social housing.  However, the Taoiseach is going to let NAMA build nine private houses to one social house.  They will be sold for &euro;300,000.

The Taoiseach has been reported as having been involved in lobbying with Chancellor Merkel in working to delay cuts to car carbon dioxide targets.  This is happening in tandem with the Volkswagen scandal that emerged when vehicular emissions were deliberately misrepresented to the public and it turned out that there had been interference with and manipulation of vehicles to give false readings.  We know that German Governments have had very close ties with Volkswagen.  The last President of Germany, the previous Chancellor and the current Deputy Chancellor have all held seats on Volkswagen's board.  <i>The New York Times<\/i>has reported that the Taoiseach actually lobbied on behalf of the Chancellor for Germany's car makers in order to have the directive watered down until, I believe, 2021.  The Taoiseach worked with Chancellor Merkel in 2013 to press Brussels to overturn an agreement on cutting emissions and postponing some regulations until 2021.  Why would he do this?  Volkswagen is now recalling 80,000 cars sold in Ireland following revelations of emissions test cheating.  I know that the German Government might have considerable influence over the Taoiseach and that the German Chancellor has considerable influence over him.  However, it is going too far for her to lobby the head of the Irish Government with a view to diluting and delaying a very important directive that goes to the heart of public health and people's well-being in terms of air quality.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach used a strange phrase in his reply to me and I did not quite pick it up.  He said he had ensured her views were passed on to those who were making the decision.  Is that correct?  That means that he actually spoke to those who were making decisions on behalf of Chancellor Merkel.  It is very nice diplomatic parliamentary language.  However, calling a spade a spade, it seems the Taoiseach reacted sympathetically to the Chancellor and lobbied on her behalf, which was the wrong thing to do.  It is scandalous and he should be clear on what transpired.  There is a huge scandal around Volkswagen and the manipulation of the emissions tests which undermines public health to a frightening degree.  It was reported during the week that one of the top risks to public health was air quality, much of which is related to the automotive industry.  There have been attempts duirng the years to improve the quality of emissions and reduce the harmful ingredients in car emissions and so on.  For the life of me, I do not know why the Taoiseach would not have told Chancellor Merkel: &quot;I am not passing this on to anybody.  We actually think this is the right thing to do.  The directive should be implemented.  The industry is lobbying, but, Chancellor, the cutting of emissions through the agreement arrived at among the Heads of State in Europe is good for the public.&quot;<\/p><p>Am I correct in saying the Taoiseach worked with Chancellor Merkel to have the regulations and agreement on car carbon dioxide targets put back to 2021 and have them diluted?  This has come about from the Volkswagen scandal.  The Taoiseach's lobbying role has been reported in <i>The New York Times<\/i>.  He needs to be far more clear than the language use in his reply suggests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900021#T01900","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453221600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I am not sure what is happening to the Deputy, but he seems to be keen to move into overdrive.  I am not sure on what he bases his belief in respect of <i>The New York Times<\/i>.  I do not know why he wants to believe <i>The New York Times<\/i>in the reports being issued here.  He has made the comment that the German Chancellor had influence over the Taoiseach.  That is not so and it is beneath the Deputy.  As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he will appreciate that one engages with one's counterparts within the European Union and beyond on issues of national, international and global importance, as he did and rightly so.<\/p><p>The main purpose of the proposed CO<sub>2<\/sub>regulations on vehicle emissions standards was to confirm CO<sub>2<\/sub>reduction targets for 2020 which had been provisionally agreed in 2008.  During our Presidency of the Council in the first six months of 2013, a great deal of progress was made.  The file in question was on the agenda for the last meeting of permanent representatives, COREPER, during Ireland's Presidency in June 2013 for the analysis of a provisional agreement which had been reached in the trialogue negotiations by the Irish Presidency with the Commission and the European Parliament.  At that meeting some member states asked that a decision on the final negotiated compromise be postponed, as they needed more time to consider it.<\/p><p>Given that the objective of any EU Presidency is to achieve the maximum possible consensus, we agreed with this.  The measure was subsequently adopted later in 2013 under the Lithuanian Presidency.  While it would have been a welcome achievement to have finalised the negotiations during our Presidency, it is normal for member states to ask for and be granted the time required to consider the outcome of complex negotiations carefully before giving their agreement.  The time extension was sought primarily by Germany.  It was also sought by Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  The matter was dealt with at the last meeting of COREPER, without it being placed on the agenda of the European Council which I had the privilege to attend with the President of the Council.  It was signed off on subsequently by the Lithuanians.<\/p> <p> This is a complex issue.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin seeks to tie it with the Volkswagen scandal in the United States and wants to lump Ireland in as a party to it.  That is beneath him.  The recent Volkswagen disclosure relates to falsifying pollution emission test results for some models of VW diesel cars with 1.2, 1.6 and 2 litre engines.  These vehicles, as the Deputy knows well, were fitted with sensor or software-defeat devices which recognised when a vehicle was being tested and then reduced emissions accordingly.  That is illegal under European law.  The Deputy is now suggesting that, through a telephone call to me about normal business from the German Chancellor, we were subsequently involved in some illegal scam.  That is also beneath him.<\/p> <p> This issue relates solely to pollutants emitted from vehicles, primarily nitrogen oxide emissions.  The relevant legislation covering diesel engines, the Euro 5\/6 regulation of 2007, specifies emissions limits for all important toxic complete pollutants.  The Volkswagen fraud concerns nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel cars and as such is not directly related to the emissions standards directive agreed to in 2013 which covers carbon dioxide emissions and different matters.  Carbon dioxide emissions are directly relevant to climate change, which is why efforts were made to reduce emissions, including those from transport.  Nitrogen oxide emissions, while also climate-related, are primarily of concern because of their impact on human health.<\/p> <p> The manipulation by Volkswagen of data for the level of harmful nitrogen oxide emissions and diesel cars is estimated to affect over 100,000 vehicles in this country.  Initial concerns about unexplained inconsistencies related to petrol engines which could have affected carbon dioxide emissions from approximately 9,000 cars have been found not to be valid.  The falsifying of emissions data is an extremely serious matter and is being investigated and followed up at European level, with investigations led by the anti-fraud squad of the European Commission and the European Parliament.  The Commission is also taking a co-ordinating role in investigations at national level by member states.  In Ireland several Departments and Government agencies are actively involved, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; Transport, Tourism and Sport; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; the Road Safety Authority and the National Standards Association of Ireland.<\/p> <p> In the case of cars affected by the manipulation of nitrogen oxide emissions data, Volkswagen is planning to commence a programme of remedial recalls in January.  This may require hardware changes in up to half of the cases involved and may take more than one year to complete.  Where the emissions scandal was initially confined to cars in the Volkswagen Group, the German regulator, KBA, Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, which has taken the lead on the issue at European level, has expanded its investigation into more than 50 models from other manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes, Ford, Volvo and Nissan.  Recent reports indicate that Renault may also be affected.<\/p> <p> Although details are still unclear in terms of the scale of the impact as to whether the carbon dioxide tax band ratings of petrol cars will be affected, it is possible that there may be implications for car owners in the context of motor taxation.  Volkswagen has written to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and other relevant Ministers, undertaking that additional taxes arising from fuel consumption in terms of carbon dioxide discrepancies will be settled by the company.  Once the impacts are clear following the ongoing investigations, consideration will be given to whether any further action should be taken.<\/p> <p> I want to make it clear to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that when I had the opportunity and privilege to host the EU Presidency, it was my duty and responsibility to deal with other leaders who might make calls or comments or deal with information.  For the Deputy to suggest that, because we held Presidency, we suddenly lobbied on an issue that had been discussed by countries at COREPER is certainly beneath him.

The visit to Ireland formed part of a longer trip which included Prime Minister Modi's attendance at the UN General Assembly.  I also travelled to attend the General Assembly and I recently reported details of that trip to the House.<\/p>  <p>  Although the visit of Prime Minister Modi was relatively brief, it was nonetheless very significant, given the importance of our economic and political relationship and the fact that this was the first visit to Ireland by an Indian Prime Minister for almost 60 years.  At the meeting I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Education and Sills, the Minister for Health and a number of officials.<\/p>  <p>  Prime Minister Modi and I had a very positive and constructive discussion covering a number of bilateral issues.  Ireland and India have historically enjoyed strong links, dating back as far as our respective independence movements.  Our relationship today continues to be strong, extending beyond cultural links to include, among other things, trade, investment and education.  During our meeting I reiterated an invitation to the President of India to make a state visit to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On economic issues, Prime Minister Modi outlined his programme of economic reform and his government's aim of ensuring that India's economic progress continues and that development spreads throughout the country.  I outlined the strength of Ireland's economic recovery and highlighted a number of areas where Irish companies could make important contributions to Indian needs, including in the areas of water technology, information and communications technology, ICT, and health care.  Both Prime Minister Modi and I discussed the potential for increased investment in each other's countries.  I welcomed the announcement of 110 new jobs in Dublin by Indian company, NIIT Technologies, on the day of the Prime Minister's visit.  Since the visit we have also seen a significant jobs announcement by the Indian technology company, Infosys.<\/p>  <p>  Education is an area of strong co-operation between Ireland and India.  The Prime Minister mentioned his government's efforts to enhance the accessibility of education their - its \"Digital India\" campaign.  I welcomed the increase in the number of Indian students studying in Ireland, which has nearly doubled since 2012.  Both sides expressed the importance of continuing to expand these important linkages.<\/p>  <p>  We discussed health care and specific proposals to ensure that medical internships carried out in India are recognised in the Irish system.  These proposals will be addressed in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted by the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  We also discussed a number of multilateral issues including UN reform, peacekeeping, nuclear disarmament and Syria.  On the latter, I provided Prime Minister Modi with an update on the steps taken at EU level to address the ongoing migration crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Prime Minister Modi made reference to his disappointment that the negotiations on the EU-India free trade agreement had stalled.  Speaking on this point, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, agreed that the temporary delay was disappointing but expressed the hope that negotiations could resume and progress be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  At the conclusion of the meeting, Prime Minister Modi paid tribute to the Irish experience of 1916 and spoke of how the centenary in 2016 would provide good opportunities for co-operation in acknowledging that shared aspect of our histories.  I know that the Irish and India ambassadors are considering how we might take this forward and develop it in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900023#V01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1453222800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och den Taoiseach f&aacute; choinne an fhreagra soil&eacute;ire sin.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged, Ireland and India have a long and shared history and many shared cultural values.  We were both colonised and endured many centuries of struggle and India like Ireland was partitioned but, unfortunately, our island remains partitioned.  We also share difficulties created by climate change.  There is a desire for greater economic co-operation, as the Taoiseach outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Recent news coverage showed that hundreds of people died during the heavy rains in parts of India and there was huge disruption and devastation when the rainfall was three times the norm.  The agreement, as the Taoiseach will know, at the Paris climate change conference represents and presents important opportunities and challenges for this State, the Indian state and the 200 other countries that signed up to it, but the devil is in the details and all of this depends on implementation.  Agreeing to reduce greenhouse gases, the impact of this on the developed and less developed states and a fund to help the poorer regions of the world will present significant challenges in the decades ahead.  Did the Taoiseach have any opportunity to go into the detail of all of that?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spelt out some of the economic opportunities.  According to the UN World Economic Situation and Prospects 2016 report, India will have the fastest growing economy in the world this year and next year, with predictions of 7.3% growth.  The same report predicts that the global financial conditions will be volatile and may see diminished trade flows and stagnant investment.  There are very significant opportunities for us to increase trade and investment.  As the Taoiseach acknowledged, Irish exports to India are worth more than &euro;55 million a year and almost 3,000 people here are employed by Indian companies.  That is a marked increase from &euro;34 million in 2012.  Also, companies like the Kerry Group and Glanbia have a presence in India and there is potential for growth especially in the areas of technology, pharmaceuticals and agriculture with a growing and huge market with more than 3 million of a middle class.  It is estimated, and the Taoiseach acknowledged this in his response, that 1,500 students from India are in higher educational institutions here.  Around 26,000 India people live on the island, mostly in this part of it.<\/p>  <p>  During his visit, Prime Minister Modi indicated there would be growth in the number of flights and air routes between our two states.  Does the Taoiseach have any information on this?  Can he indicate what steps the IDA is taking to increase our economic footprint in India?  Were there any discussions about sending an economic delegation to India?  If there is any possibility of that type of approach, I suggest that we include our opposite numbers in the North, Invest NI and the appropriate Ministers.  I know the Taoiseach has been a champion of this in the past with other overseas economic delegations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900023#V01300","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1453222800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Clearly, with a population of 1.2 billion, more than one sixth of the world's population, India has become one of the fastest growing major economies on the globe.  Since it began a campaign of economic liberalisation in 1991, India has recorded continuously high growth rates.<\/p><p>Currently, that growth is being propelled by sectors which include aviation, education, the agritech sector, medical devices, e-commerce and software-as-a-service, SWAS, offerings.  Many of the sectors are areas where, as the Deputy pointed out, Irish companies have particular strengths and it is imperative, therefore, that we provide them with the appropriate supports to capitalise on this opportunity.  The Prime Minister specifically mentioned the difficulties India is having with the Ganges, which is an enormous river of 2,500 miles.  We have since made contact with the Prime Minister&rsquo;s officials in respect of a number of Irish technology firms which deal with wastewater and its treatment that may be of interest or assistance to India.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy pointed out, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has invested significant effort in improving our trade links with India.  Enterprise Ireland has an office in New Delhi, which offers in-market support for Irish businesses in India.  IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland both operate from Mumbai.  All of those agencies participate in what is called the local market team.  The team is chaired by our ambassador to India and it co-ordinates the trade and investment efforts of all the agencies under a shared market strategy and plan.<\/p> <p> Nine focused trade missions have taken place to India during the lifetime of the Government.  Clearly, they are an invaluable way of developing new and existing markets overseas for Irish businesses.  In that context I can inform Deputy Adams that we have been very willing to associate with trade missions or Ministers from Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p> India is one of the fastest growing tourist generating countries in the world.  Tourism Ireland estimates that the number of Indian visitors coming here in 2014 increased by approximately 10% and 2015 will see a further increase.  I will bring the Deputy up to date in respect of the flight connections when we see what is happening in this regard.<\/p> <p> In respect of education, staff from the Department of Education and Skills and their colleagues in the education in Ireland section of Enterprise Ireland have been working to increase the educational links between the two countries.  In 2012, there were approximately 850 Indian students in Ireland.  The number has increased to approximately 1,500 students studying in Ireland, mainly for postgraduate degrees in engineering, the pharmaceutical area, business, accounting, computer sciences and hospitality management.  A significant number of Irish institutes have developed links with Indian institutes and colleges.<\/p> <p> The scholarships given by this country that are administered by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and supported and funded by the Department of Education and Skills entitle scholars to a waiver of tuition fees of approximately &euro;15,000 for the term of the scholarship and a grant to the value of &euro;7,500 to cover living expenses.  The scholarships are awarded to candidates who have an excellent academic record, and in the 2015 to 2016 academic year, seven Government of Ireland scholarships have been awarded to students from India.  In addition to the Government of Ireland scholarship programme, Irish higher education systems and institutions offer in the region of 200 scholarships which target Indian students each year.<\/p> <p> A number of negotiations took place in respect of the European Union-India free trade agreement negotiations.  They broke down because of the mismatch between ambitions and expectations.  The parties got together again and the Commission short-listed three areas where the European Union would like to see progress before entering a decision-making process.  First, the EU needs to receive a very clear signal from India on the removal of barriers to other services sectors, including insurance, banking, maritime and accountancy.  Second, the EU wants to finalise the goods package, which is a balanced automotive package, and the European Union red lines on duty rates on wines and spirits are critical.  Third, the EU wants an agreement to finalise procurement negotiations by signature, including comprehensive coverage on market access to the central level and an overall chapter with allowances for sufficiently ambitious commitments.<\/p> <p> A meeting of the chief trade negotiators on both sides, which was due to be held in Delhi in August, was indefinitely postponed by the Indian ministry for commerce and industry after the EU imposed a legally binding ban on the sale of approximately 700 pharma products clinically tested by GVK Biosciences in Hyderabad.<\/p> <p> The EU-India free trade negotiations are of interest to Ireland.  Dairy products and whiskeys are key areas of export opportunity, which are currently subjected to very restrictive tariffs and non-tariff barriers.  We are of the view that it would be very desirable for further meetings to take place to put some momentum back into the discussions between Europe and India.<\/p> <p> I can inform Deputy Adams that we discussed other issues such as membership of the UN Security Council, the Security Council veto, migration and a number of other related issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900023#V01400","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453223400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify matters for me.  I welcome the visit of Prime Minister Modi to Ireland.  I was on the previous trade mission to India with the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, when we developed a range of strands of the relationship in terms of the economy, trade, education and culture.  The Taoiseach mentioned medical internships.  I understand from his reply that he suggested there would be an agreement of mutual recognition between the Medical Council and the Medical Council of India.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether that is in respect of Indians coming to Ireland to work as interns and do their training here?  In addition, will he outline the specifics of the agreement?  Was a memo signed between Ireland and India on health?<\/p>  <p>  Were there any discussions on India&rsquo;s nuclear programme, which is expressly for civilian purposes, in terms of providing energy to its vast population?  The Taoiseach mentioned tariffs.  Did he have any substantive discussions on the excessive tariffs India continues to levy on whiskies imported into India?  Irish whiskey and European whiskies are generally at an enormous disadvantage in terms of penetrating the Indian market because of the excessive tariffs levied by the Indian Government.  Was there any discussion between the Taoiseach and the Indian Prime Minister in this regard?  Was the wider issue of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, discussed with the Prime Minister?<\/p>  <p>  In the education area, were any ideas on research developed at the meeting, for example, in terms of research partnerships in specific areas, be it pharmaceutical, life sciences or technology?<\/p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Irish diplomatic and trade and enterprise footprint is sufficient to meet current needs and future potential given that in many ways the 21st century will belong to Asia, notwithstanding current difficulties, and that over a 50-year span there will be significant growth potential?  Do we have enough Enterprise Ireland offices in India?

Clearly, the opportunity for investment to Europe is very significant.<\/p><p>The investment and opportunity through Ireland to Europe is also very significant.  If one looks at the number of people we have there, either with Enterprise Ireland or through the diplomatic service, namely, the ambassador and the team, one can never say we have enough.  Those who are there do a first-class job.  It is the same as in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.  We have other real opportunities in other countries in Asia, such as Korea, Indonesia and China.  The discussions foundered between Europe and India because of the mismatch I spoke of.  I had hoped that from a European point of view, which would have direct benefit for Ireland, that we could get this moving again.  In our discussions with the Prime Minister, we referred to these barriers.  Clearly they are anxious to get back on track with the European free trade discussions with India, which I very much support.<\/p> <p> The Deputy mentioned the health issue.  We discussed health care and specific proposals to ensure medical internships carried out in India are recognised in the Irish system.  There is a problem, which the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, was very well aware of and the proposals were to be addressed in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was then being drafted in the Department of Health.

The Deputy mentioned a number of other things.  India requested to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, as it is called.  We indicated to Prime Minister Modi that Ireland was prepared to join a consensus on the Missile Technology Control Regime at a recent meeting in Rotterdam but no consensus emerged from that.   India had also submitted an application for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, NSG, and Ireland is aware of India's keen interest in membership of the two groups involved.  We appreciate its importance in terms of enhancing their capacity to trade in civil nuclear technologies.  The recent NSG plenary meeting looked at the question of membership of the group for states which are not parties to the non-proliferation treaty, NPT, and agreed that this issue would continue to be examined by the group.  Ireland looks forward to taking part in these discussions and to continuing to take an active part in it.<\/p>  <p>  The question of UN Security Council reform was also mentioned.  We are very supportive of Security Council reform.  Ireland has continued to be very frustrated at the slow pace of reform and the impact it has on the council being able to act as efficiently and effectively as it should.  We believe the five elements of UN Security Council reform are interconnected as part of a single package: categories of membership, the question of the veto, regional representation, the size of an enlarged council, and working methods and the relationship between the council and the General Assembly.  One can only get success if there is agreement on all these five areas.  We are very supportive as a country of the intergovernmental negotiations and Security Council reform and we believe now is a very opportune time to move towards what is referred to as text-based negotiations, that is, putting it down in writing.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of the composition and membership of the UN Security Council, Prime Minister Modi raised the issue of UN reform and he specifically highlighted India's desire for a permanent seat at the Security Council.  We recognise, as we have always done, that there is a need to expand the membership of the Security Council so it better reflects 21st century realities in a regionally balanced way.  Any expansion of membership should accommodate member states that play a particularly significant part in the United Nations system.  However, Ireland would want to prevent any diminution in the capacity of smaller member states to serve as non-permanent members on a rotating basis at regular intervals, as Deputy Martin is aware happens now.<\/p>  <p>  On the final issue of the question of the veto at the Security Council, we firmly oppose the conferral of veto powers on any new members.  Similar to many other states, we believe that extending the veto right to additional members of the council will only compound the difficulties associated with the current arrangements regarding veto rights.  We wish to see the veto rights of the five permanent members of the Security Council - the P5 - ended.  We are a supporter of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group which has launched a code of conduct calling for positive action by all members of the United Nations to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity.  We have associated ourselves with the political declaration which was presented by Mexico and France calling for the voluntary suspension of the veto by permanent members of the Security Council in cases of mass atrocities.  Deputy Martin is also aware that I was at the UN summit in September on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, and a new global development agenda was set out there.  A key component of that was the sustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda.  That is the second of three major international agreements to be concluded in 2015 to promote sustainable development at the global level.  The conference in Paris in December 2015 was a very significant achievement to which we will measure up when final targets are set for Ireland.  In my address at the summit, I reiterated our commitment to make progress towards the target of 0.7% of GDP for overseas development aid, a central part of achieving the sustainable development goals.  These were also matters that we referred to in the discussion with Prime Minister Modi. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900025#X00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>May I make a brief submission?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900025#X00400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I am anxious to move on to the next question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900025#X00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>It is an important point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900025#X00600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>The Deputy should be quick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900025#X00700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach mentioned, in response to my question on the nuclear issue, that India was anxious to be part of a new Missile Technology Control Regime.

My question is related to Brexit, whether the Economic Management Council has a responsibility for preparing Ireland's plans for a possible British exit from the European Union and asks whether the Taoiseach will make a statement on the matter.  I take it that he is aware that the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has confirmed that the potential loss to Ireland could be as much as &euro;4 billion in exports and that this could have an extremely serious impact on the market here.  There have already been reports that some companies are becoming risk averse and taking less business risk.  Despite Members' earlier conversations on the visit by the Prime Minister of India, the bottom line is that the United Kingdom is still our most important market, particularly for the agrifood industry.  In 2013, for example, it bought 50% of Ireland's beef and there were 95 IDA Ireland-backed UK companies based in Ireland.  The United Kingdom is also our most important tourism market and the effect of the current favourable exchange rate between sterling and the euro can be seen in certain parts of the country that are benefiting.<\/p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach met the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, on Brexit, he asked for Ireland's support.  The backdrop to that meeting was the horrific bombings and terrorism in Paris and negotiations on Brexit rightly appear to have been put aside temporarily.  Moreover, the migration crisis is also becoming difficult to resolve.  However, given the significance of this issue and the potential implications for Ireland of Britain leaving the European Union, will the Taoiseach outline to Members how the Government intends to plan for it?  Will he indicate whether scenario planning has been done by the Government on the referendum that will be held in Britain?  The ESRI has indicated that there is a possibility of net migration of approximately 60,000 people from the United Kingdom in the event that there is a Brexit and suggests there could be an impact on wages.  While the Taoiseach has indicated that a Government sub-committee is overseeing it, has an interdepartmental group been formed with overall responsibility or accountability for this issue?  I ask because I get the sense there is not a strong awareness among the public about the potential implications for the economy of Britain leaving the European Union.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach were to indicate the Government's structured response and the work that has been done to date on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900026#Y00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>As time is short, I ask Deputy Gerry Adams to put his questions now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900026#Y00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I understand the Taoiseach may be restricted in the details he can outline, but are there plans to minimise economic disruption in the event that a referendum in Britain results in a vote to leave?  Obviously, because our two islands are in close proximity, a decision by Britain to leave the European Union is of considerable interest to us, a point the Taoiseach has outlined in the past.  However, given that the exit also may include the Northern state, this is a matter of considerable concern for everyone.  As more than &euro;1 billion per week is traded in goods and services between the State and Britain, the consequences of a UK exit for us in this part of the country would be enormous.  However, one should also be mindful that for 80 years the physical Border and partition, with its economic, cultural and political outworkings, were a source of enormous dislocation and conflict at times.  The Good Friday Agreement has seen a transformation and, as I am sure the Taoiseach has experienced many times, the physical Border is now all but invisible.  There is much work to be done to remove economic and political barriers and all of the other legacy issues, but I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the return of Border controls would be a serious retrograde step.  The impact on both sides, along the entire Border corridor, would be detrimental.  I also believe there would be an adverse effect on all-Ireland bodies that are part of the Good Friday Agreement.  As the Taoiseach is aware, I come from there and it should not be accepted that a decision taken on the island of Britain would have such import for those of us who live in the North.  Has the Government sought or will it seek an assurance from the British Government that a referendum vote in the North alone will determine the relationship between that part of the island and the European Union?<\/p>  <p>  Another big issue arises in this regard, in so far as the British Prime Minister has indicated he may introduce legislation to make it clear that the British Parliament is sovereign and that British courts are not bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  This will have profound implications for citizens in the North and, in particular, our ability to use the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as a defence against punitive British legislation.  All of this is playing out on the Taoiseach's watch.  I am aware that another European Council meeting has been set for 18 and 19 February.  The meeting last December set the explicit objective of securing an agreement or mutually satisfactory solutions.  In the light of this and the timetable set by the European Council and the British Government, will the Taoiseach outline the Government's view on these matters?  In addition, does the Government have in place a contingency plan if a Brexit goes ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900026#Y00400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1453224600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>This is a serious matter in the context of challenges facing the country.  Obviously, while we must hold a general election in Ireland, Europe faces a number of challenges that will be of highly significant import, of which this is one.  Issues such as migration, oil, energy costs, climate change, the impact of the great powers and the situation in the Middle East are not within our control, but they have an impact on this country and its economy.  The important point to make to the Deputies who are as interested as everybody else is the detail of the proposals has yet to be tabled in this case.  Everyone is cognisant of the potential impact of what might happen when the question is asked of the British electorate whose decision it is to stay in.  Britain is our largest and nearest trading partner and the fact that trade to the value of &euro;1 billion takes place across the Irish Sea every week speaks for itself.  Obviously, currency fluctuations can have an impact on trade either way in tourism, the hospitality sector, production, manufacturing and exports.  While a paper is to be circulated by President Tusk in the near future, I do not know what it will entail and nor do I wish to commit to presuming to know what will be the outcome of the British people's decision.  Suffice it to say the Government is sufficiently interested in this matter to be highly public in its support for Britain remaining a strong and central part of the European Union.  Ireland has made its decision on the fiscal stability treaty, our entrance to the European Union and commitment to the euro, the eurozone and the Union.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, four clusters or baskets of issues were set out.  One cluster pertained to economic governance, which includes moves to prevent non-eurozone countries such as the United Kingdom from being disadvantaged by decisions taken solely in the eurozone.  That is a good basis for discussion.  I believe the euro area must have the capacity to do what is necessary to ensure financial stability and economic growth.  It must also, however, act with full respect for the Single Market which comprises the entire European Union, as well as for the integrity of the Union as a whole, without prejudice to any interest of member states.  I consider this to be an achievable goal.  The Government appreciates the concerns of the United Kingdom and other non-euro countries in this regard and while this is an issue that obviously requires some serious analysis, it can be dealt with.  <\/p>  <p>  A second basket of issues concerns making the European Union more competitive.  This includes the completion of the Single Market, better regulation and expediting international trade agreements.  Ireland shares quite a number of Britain's priorities in this area and welcomes steps that will give impetus to growth, competitiveness and employment.<\/p><p> The third one concerns steps to enhance national sovereignty.  Those steps relate to strengthening the role of national parliaments in the EU as well as addressing the concept of an ever-closer union.  We always have had a constructive approach to this proposition and believe that a solution can be found to that particular issue.<\/p> <p> The question of migration and welfare is one that is of great concern to people.  It is clear what happened in Cologne is appalling.  I saw the response from Syrian men and women who said this is not what their country represents.  It is a very sensitive issue and something which cannot be condoned in any circumstance but discussions at the December Council showed broad agreement that abuses of free movement should be targeted without calling the principle of free movement into question.  I think this is acceptable to everyone and we are supportive of action to achieve it.  In addition, we agree that welfare systems should not, in themselves, be a pull factor in encouraging migrant workers to come to any country but any reform would have to have full respect for equality and non-discrimination.  At the meeting, President Juncker said the Commission would like to look at a number of options in respect of this category, which is where the real difficulty was being experienced following the Prime Minister's tabling of these issues.<\/p> <p> No one here would want to see the common travel area coming under pressure and border controls between here and Britain or Northern Ireland, as rightly pointed out by Deputy Adams.  The issue, in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, is of great importance to us.  Deputy Martin referred to the ESRI report which was commissioned by the Department of Finance and published on 5 November.  It considered the impact of a British exit on Ireland across trade, foreign direct investment, energy and migration and found that, aside from the UK, Ireland would be the most adversely affected European member state.  We should not assume, therefore, that we do not have an interest in this issue.<\/p> <p> None of the findings in the report made an Irish case for a British withdrawal from the European Union.  We have been very public about our support for the British Prime Minister and Britain's continued membership.  A number of other studies are also available which point out the economic, political and social implications of a potential British exit from the EU for Ireland, Europe and Britain.  The Institute of International and European Affairs published a study in March of last year which identified key areas that would be impacted.  These included trade, energy and foreign direct investment.  It concluded that the precise impacts would depend on the trade arrangements that would be put in place to manage bilateral economic relations in the event of a British exit.  The key issue is that Britain is our number one trading partner and we are its fifth most important market.  The trade is valued at approximately &euro;1 billion per week.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Adams raised the question in Northern Ireland.  As I stated when I spoke to the Confederation of British Industry, the ESRI found that Northern Ireland could be the most adversely affected region of the UK in the event of a British exit.  This is extremely worrying on a number of levels.  The EU has been an important if, perhaps, underestimated enabler of peace in Northern Ireland.  It provided &euro;2.4 billion in funds over the period 2007 to 2013 to help Northern Ireland overcome the challenges faced by a peripheral region emerging from conflict.  Common membership of the EU project is part of the glue that holds that transition process together and now is not the time to weaken a cohesive, stabilising influence and outward focus that shared EU membership brings to Northern Ireland.  <\/p> <p> While we are conscious of these things, our best opportunity at the moment is to work with British industry and British needs in this country to explain the importance and the potential implications of a decision that might be made by the British people.

The Taoiseach will agree it is very disturbing to read about how a hospital discharged an 81 year old woman who, following a stroke, is unable to swallow.  She was deemed clinically unsuitable for peg feeding and is, therefore, facing the possibility of starving to death.  It seems incredible and there must be a proper investigation into how this was allowed to happen.  The woman's GP has highlighted the case and is saying what has occurred is unethical.  The case, which is a serious and potentially harrowing case, is being reviewed by the President of the High Court.  Will the Taoiseach speak to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in the context of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that he mentioned earlier.  Is there any prospect of dealing with this issue via any vehicle?  It seems extraordinary that decisions of this kind are now being taken.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will have read that AIB is offering a one year deposit rate of 1.4% to German savers, which is three times that which is on offer to Irish savers.<\/p><p>Many are asking why AIB is treating Irish customers in a far less effective way than German customers.  Why are they being discriminated against?  Have there been any discussions between the Government and AIB about this?  Has the Central Bank any role?<br\/><br\/>The third issue concerns the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) Act 2015, the Taoiseach's comments on which have been very interesting.  He spoke about the importance of press freedom and he is reported in today's <i>Irish Independent <\/i>as rebuking the watchdog for spying on journalists.  He was described as slapping down GSOC for snooping on the phone records of journalists.  One could be forgiven for thinking he was commentating on somebody else's legislation but, in fact, this was the Government's legislation.  The implication is that the Government is now disavowing the legislation.  The Taoiseach has indicated that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald is bringing in amending legislation in this regard.  Was the Taoiseach slapping down GSOC for this?  Are those reports correct?  When can we expect the amended legislation to deal with this issue?<br\/><br\/>To be helpful, Deputy Niall Collins has drafted and published legislation, which should be on the Order Paper, which would require GSOC to apply to the High Court before it monitors any phones.  This would have the desired impact of protecting press freedom while allowing GSOC to pursue its legitimate work.  Will the Government give some of its own time to accept Deputy Collins's Bill?  It would put flesh on the bones of the comments the Taoiseach was making this morning about GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900027#Z00500","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453225800,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I read the report in respect of the elderly lady the Deputy speaks of who has a particular set of challenges, and I note the intervention of the President of the High Court.  There is a health Bill, which is published, which deals with the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Dentists Act 1985, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, the Pharmacy Act, and the Nurses and Midwives Act to provide for amendments required for the transposition of Directive 2013\/55 EU in an appeal against minor sanctions.  I am not sure whether that covers it or not but I will advise Deputy Martin on that.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the question that he mentioned about AIB, that is an online platform for a different situation.  The bank has made a commercial decision to allow for higher interest rates of more than 1% on deposits which would, I suppose, be seen as an attractive introductory market for outside deposits.  It is not part of the relationship between the Government and the bank here.  It has made that commercial decision itself.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of reports today about the question of the retention of data and the communications therein, I want to make it perfectly clear that I have absolute confidence in Ms Justice Ring, who is the chair of GSOC.  It should be pointed out that there is no interpretation that GSOC has done anything incorrect.  It has followed the law and has very high standards in this regard.  There is oversight by another eminent member of the Judiciary.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will make a statement or announcement on this, I think later this evening, in respect of the decision taken by Government to have a review of this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  For the information of the House, there are five areas to which the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 applies: the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Defence Forces for purposes of safeguarding the security of the State, the Revenue Commissioners in respect of serious specified revenue offences, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in respect of serious specified competition offences.  The Government reflected on the matter this morning and the Minister for Justice and Equality may well have issued a statement by now or otherwise will do so.  I want to make it clear that the Government has absolute confidence in GSOC, the chair of GSOC and in the oversight judge.<\/p>  <p>  I am not responsible for headline reports.  This is a complicated matter and is not as simple as it might seem initially.  The Government has made a decision to look at the legislation.

The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that those who own a vehicle which was registered prior to July 2008 will be able to avail of the cheaper system of taxation introduced in 2008 but which is currently only available to vehicles which were registered post-July 2008.<\/p><p>In a republic, every citizen should be treated equally before the law and nowhere should this be more apparent than in our taxation system, which I believe should be progressive.  This is not the case for those with older vehicles, so the young, the elderly and people on lower incomes are discriminated against in our State in regard to car tax.  In certain circumstances, they pay up to three times as much car tax as those with newer vehicles, so a person driving a 2016 diesel BMW 520 can be paying one third the amount of tax a person driving a 2007 Nissan Micra is paying.<\/p><p>We must look at how this can be changed while still complying with the CO<sub>2<\/sub>requirements as stipulated in the 2008 Act.  The explanatory note to my Bill sets out clearly how this can be done.  As some pre-2008 vehicles will not be able to comply with CO<sub>2<\/sub>specifications for the purposes of taxation and in circumstances where pre-2008 vehicles were purchased before the CO<sub>2<\/sub>legislation system for road tax, they cannot retrospectively comply with the legislation, which did not exist at the time the vehicles were purchased.  For this reason, pre-2008 vehicle owners will be allowed the option of road tax based on CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions or engine size, whichever is the lower of the two.  The level of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions can be based on the certificate provided by the manufacturer or, in the absence of a manufacturer's certificate, the level of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions can be tested as part of the NCT test.  Given this level is listed on the NCT test results, the car owner does not incur an extra cost but owners will be able to readily see their CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions level.<\/p><p>At the moment, the legislation discriminates against those who cannot afford to purchase a vehicle dating from 2008 onwards, a category which, as I said, includes the young, the elderly and those on lower incomes.  All road users and taxpayers should receive equality of treatment.  Therefore, I hope the Government will see fit to agree to the implementation of this Bill.<\/p><p>To give an example of the operation of the current system, a person driving a 2007 Opel Astra will pay &euro;544 annually in road tax whereas a person driving a 2015 Opel Astra will pay &euro;280.  There is obviously an anomaly in the system in that many cars registered prior to July 2008 have the exact same engines and electronic management systems as cars purchased post-July 2008.  If we want a progressive system and want to encourage people to use more efficient cars, this makes no sense.  There are systems which can remap the engine of a vehicle to make it more fuel-efficient and lower the CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  Why would we not encourage people to do that?  Given we have the technology to do so, we should encourage drivers to lower the CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions if that was the real purpose of the 2008 legislation, rather than it just being tax collection.<\/p><p>This is progressive legislation that would benefit all road users, particularly young people who are trying to get a job for the first time and need a car to travel to work and elderly people on pensions who cannot afford a new vehicle but find the annual level of road tax crippling.<\/p><p>Any government that ignores this cohort of society, who can least afford to tax their vehicles, is out of touch with society.  It is all well and good to feel that one can buy a new car and there will be no problem, but the majority of people in this country who suffered throughout the recession are not in a position to buy a new vehicle and need to be encouraged to try to make their cars more efficient.  This Bill is a positive measure and I hope the Government agrees to implement it.  I look forward to the Bill going before the House in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900029#BB02500","speaker":"1211","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453227000,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453227000,"counter":393,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453227000,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1453227000,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC00500","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1453227000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC00600","speaker":"1211"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453227000,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Association Agreement between the European Union and Central America: Referral to Select Committee","time":1453227000,"counter":398,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1453227000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Association Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Central America on the other, signed at Tegucigalpa, Honduras on 29th June, 2012, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 6th January, 2016, be referred to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, in accordance with Standing Order 82A(3)(b), which, not later than 27th January, 2016, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 87, and Standing Order 86(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC00900","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453227000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Council: Statements","time":1453227000,"counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC01100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453227000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the outcome of the European Council which took place on 17 and 18 December.  The context for the meeting was no easier than it is today, with the ongoing migration and refugee crisis continuing to pose the most serious of challenges for the European Union.  This crisis was the first item on the Council agenda.  Heads of State and Government assessed what has been done so far and looked at further shaping and implementation of a comprehensive EU approach.<\/p>  <p>  Another important item was the debate about Britain's membership of the EU which, post the European Council, has moved forward into a crucial phase.  The November letter from Prime Minister Cameron and the December letter from the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, set the context for a substantive and constructive discussion by Heads of State and Government about the British proposals for reform of the EU, with the intention now to reach agreement on a package of measures at the February European Council.<\/p>  <p>  The meeting also reviewed Europe's actions in the fight against terrorism, building on the decisions taken at its February meeting and in light of the barbaric attacks in Paris and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  These three items dominated the discussions in December.  A number of other items were also discussed, including international developments such as the situations in Syria, Ukraine and, briefly, Libya; certain economic and financial issues, taking stock of discussions on the five Presidents' report on economic and monetary union and developments in the Internal Market; and, finally, energy union and a forward-looking climate policy.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to address the issues of energy union and the climate policy in his statement.<\/p>  <p>  The migration crisis was central to discussions at the December European Council, as it has been for much of last year and as it is expected to be in the year ahead.  This is a highly challenging issue.  The number of people seeking refuge over the past number of months is without precedent for the European Union, and it is true that as a Union we have struggled to chart an effective way through the complexities of the situation.  Recent appalling events in Cologne and elsewhere in Europe, as well as the unprecedented border closures, some involving countries such as Sweden and Denmark which had a common travel area that predated their EU membership, have called into question fundamental principles of the European Union and demonstrate the need to respond in a measured and balanced fashion.<\/p>  <p>  For our part, Ireland has consistently called for an approach at the European level which addresses the root causes as well as the humanitarian challenges.  This has also been a feature of our national response.  I am proud of the contribution that Ireland has made in response to the crisis, in particular the endeavours of our Defence Forces, which have deservedly been commended in this House and elsewhere on previous occasions.  The Union has worked hard to develop a comprehensive response to the crisis, with many difficult discussions along the way.  However, having reached agreement on critically important issues such as \"hotspots\", registration, control of external borders, relocation and returns, implementation has been disappointingly slow.<\/p>  <p>  In our case, for example, the Government agreed in September to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers into Ireland through a combination of resettlement and relocation programmes, and although the resettlement aspect of this is advancing with 176 individuals having already arrived in the State and more expected over the coming months, the relocation aspect has been very slow.  We await an update this week on the progress of the first grouping of asylum applications under this framework.  The delay has been due mainly to administrative difficulties with the establishment of the hotspots and the setting up of the relocation programmes in Italy and Greece.  Consequently, in our discussions there were calls across the board for implementation of agreed measures to improve in the weeks ahead.  If we are to chart an effective response to the challenges posed by this crisis, we must deliver on the commitments we have made.<\/p>  <p>  Another feature of our discussions at the December European Council was co-operation with regional partners in the Western Balkans and in Africa, where in contrast there has been some progress, building on the high level conferences that took place last year.  In addition, we addressed relations with Turkey, a critically important partner in the region.  The European Union is committed to working with Turkey and to establishing a &euro;3 billion fund for supporting Syrian refugees based there.  Member states, including Ireland, will contribute to this fund, once the final arrangements have been agreed.  Here too, implementation will be key.  Both Turkey and the European Union have made commitments under the joint action plan agreed in November and it is imperative that these are fulfilled.  Up to now, the flow of refugees through Turkey to the EU has not diminished.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in regard to migration, there was a discussion of the European Commission's proposals for a new European border and coast guard and agreement to prioritise work on this within the next six months.  Ireland is of course not obliged to opt in to any eventual decision on this.  However, I want to make the general point that although Ireland does not participate in Schengen, we view it as a profoundly important achievement and we are committed to engaging constructively, as we have done over the past year, for example in co-operation with Frontex.<\/p>  <p>  The migration crisis, or more precisely our response to that crisis, has been described by some as the issue that will define our times.  What is clear is that we need to see much more action in the weeks and months ahead.  As member states, it is incumbent on us all to deliver on the commitments we have made.  I therefore welcome the agreement at our meeting to assess progress and to return to the issue at the next European Council in February.<\/p>  <p>  I turn now to the issue that is of the greatest strategic interest to Ireland, namely, the UK's renegotiation of its relationship with the European Union.  As I have stated many times, the UK's continued membership of the EU is a priority for Ireland, and our approach to the negotiations remains constructive and pragmatic.  At the political level, there have been regular discussions about this issue, including in my own exchanges with David Cameron.  In parallel, work has been ongoing at official level for many months now to prepare for these critically important negotiations.  As part of these efforts, officials from the Department of the Taoiseach liaise closely with other Departments as well as with our permanent representation in Brussels, our embassy in London and our embassies across the EU to ensure a comprehensive, whole-of-Government response to the key questions.<\/p>  <p>  Last month's European Council provided a first, very welcome, opportunity to have a collective discussion of the issue, with all 28 EU Heads of State and Government and the Presidents of the EU institutions, framed by the earlier exchange of letters between Prime Minister Cameron and President Tusk.  Prime Minister Cameron opened the discussion by outlining the four broad areas where he is seeking change and by explaining the complex domestic politics around the issue in the UK.  I intervened in strong terms in the subsequent discussion to present the Irish point of view, which is of course well known to this House and to the UK and other EU member states.  I spoke about the importance of the issue to Ireland, given the uniquely close political, social, economic and cultural ties between our countries.  I also emphasised the significance of UK membership to the EU as a whole and I stressed the importance of working together to find a solution that will enable the UK to remain in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the proposals themselves, Ireland is supportive of moves aimed at delivering more for our citizens.  We share the UK's enthusiasm for sustained effort under the \"competitiveness\" heading.  The issues here are the drivers of long-term prosperity for the citizens of the EU.  Under the \"economic governance\" and \"sovereignty\" headings, although the details of the proposals remain to be clarified, we can also see where solutions might lie.  In the immigration and free movement area, we can probably support the proposals, subject to the details, in regard to addressing fraud and abuse and changing the way in which child benefit is paid abroad.  The idea of limiting access to in-work benefits is more difficult and there is widespread opposition to the proposal in its current form.  However, I am hopeful that with willingness and determination, a workable solution in this area can also be found.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the debate itself, I was encouraged by the substantive and constructive exchange of views about the four categories of reform proposed by Prime Minister Cameron, including the difficulties in regard to in-work benefits.  There can be little doubt that this is a challenging and sensitive issue, but the atmosphere at the European Council meeting was very positive and there was a willingness to find a way forward.  David Cameron himself, while not withdrawing his proposal, signalled his openness to alternative ideas that would have the same effect.<\/p><p>We agreed therefore to work closely together in the period ahead with a view to reaching agreement on a package of measures at the February European Council.  The sense is that, as regards the large majority of the issues, the broad lines of agreement are emerging.  Whereas the question of welfare benefits and immigration remains difficult, work here also appears to be progressing and, as I stated, I am hopeful a solution will be found that addresses the legitimate concerns of all countries.<\/p> <p> The legal form and implications of the final package remain to be teased out but I welcome the fact that the British Prime Minister is not pressing for early treaty change.  We await the emergence of detailed proposals from President Tusk, which are expected in very early February.  These will allow all member states to develop further their responses under all four headings and to participate actively in intensive and collective preparatory work at official level leading up to the February meeting.  The aim is to secure agreement at that time on a package of measures acceptable to all of us and that will allow the British Prime Minister to recommend and campaign for a vote to remain in the European Union.<\/p> <p> The European Council took place in the aftermath of the appalling terrorist attacks in Paris in November.  These were an affront to the very values we all cherish in Europe and in the democratic world.  As I have stated before, Ireland stands in solidarity with France and we are united in our determination to counter the threat posed by global terrorism.  The discussions took stock of progress since last February when a detailed programme of criminal justice, law enforcement and border control actions was set out.  The central point of our discussions in December was that the EU has now to deliver on the agreed measures.  Building on the work of justice Ministers, we looked at enhancing information sharing and early implementation of the passenger name record directive, which was finally agreed in early December.  Further emphasis was placed on systematic and co-ordinated checks at external borders - this primarily concerns Schengen area member states - and there was a commitment to examining Commission proposals on new directives for combatting terrorism and on the illegal firearms trade.  Proposals were also made for increasing the effectiveness of the fight against terrorist financing, which were further considered by finance Ministers last Friday.<\/p> <p> Ireland has consistently called for a co-ordinated international response and a comprehensive approach to combatting terrorism.  In this regard, we welcome that the European Council proposed the stepping up of engagement with partners in North Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and the western Balkans.  The Commission, High Representative Mogherini and the EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator were tasked with taking this work forward and reporting back to the European Council.<\/p> <p> I now turn to a number of economic issues that were discussed at the European Council in December.  Deputies are aware that a report on Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union was produced in June.  This so-called \"five presidents' report\" was published under the personal authority of the President of the European Commission, in co-operation with the presidents of the euro summit, the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank and the European Parliament.  Following consideration last year in some Council formations, the report and the proposals put forward by the Commission as initial follow-up were discussed by Heads of State and Government.  The five presidents' report is an important contribution to the debate about the future of the single currency area.  It sets out the authors' vision for achieving a \"deep, fair and genuine\" economic and monetary union by 2025 in two stages.  The first of these phases, which should run to 2017, focuses on boosting competitiveness, maintaining responsible fiscal policies and completing banking union.  A second stage would run to 2025, involving more fundamental changes to the EU's economic and institutional architecture.<\/p> <p> Ireland's consistent position has been that we need to concentrate on strengthening and fully implementing the many significant reforms already agreed over the past few years.  We need to press ahead on banking union and in this context, we have welcomed the proposals for a European deposit insurance scheme presented by the Commission in November.  A further positive development on banking union was the entry into force of the Single Resolution Mechanism on 1 January of this year following ratification, including by Ireland, of the intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions.<\/p> <p> We must also continue to improve our collective engagement with the European Semester process of economic policy co-ordination.  As part of this, the Commission presented its annual growth survey package on 26 November, setting out the key priorities for supporting growth and jobs under the 2016 European Semester.  This retains the threefold emphasis established last year on investment, structural reforms and responsible public finances, which are priorities with which we fully agree.  I am pleased to note that after years of sacrifice by the Irish people, our national economy is recovering strongly but we also need to see further improvement in the economic performance of the wider euro area and EU economies.  This is important for creating the right conditions for investment and job creation, including here in Ireland.  As regards the longer-term proposals put forward in the five presidents' report, these are widely agreed not to be the immediate priority.  We agreed in December that they and other ideas need to be explored further and we undertook to come back to them before the end of 2017.<\/p> <p> The European Council also assessed the development of the Single Market, in particular in the context of the new strategy published by the Commission on 28 October.  This is a crucial initiative, including in the context of the current UK debate, and we endorsed it at our December meeting and called for ambition in its implementation.  The Single Market is Europe's main engine for growth, job creation, investment and competitiveness.  Discussions at the December European Council focused on the need to achieve a deeper and fairer Single Market for goods and services in all key areas.  The need to implement the digital Single Market and to fulfil the action plan on capital markets union was also highlighted.  These are, of course, both areas where Ireland strongly supports progress.  The meeting also highlighted the importance of the negotiations with the United States on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, agreement.  Again, this reflects our national position.  In broad terms, we see the key issue here as pressing ahead with a high level of ambition, agreeing concrete timelines and delivering results.<\/p> <p> The European Council also had a relatively brief consideration of external relations issues.  First among these was the position of Syria, where there was agreement that while only an inclusive political process can lead to a solution, there cannot be a lasting peace in Syria under the present regime.  Countries expressed support for the efforts of the global coalition to defeat the regional and global threat posed by ISIL or Daesh.  We understand appalling events have happened in recent days.  Turning to Libya, the signature of an agreement between the main parties was welcomed, although there were no illusions about the fragility of the process.  Lastly, Heads of State and Government had a brief examination of relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine.<\/p> <p> As I have outlined, the December meeting of the European Council dealt with a diverse range of issues but with the focus very much on migration and the UK issue.  I look forward to hearing Deputies' comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900030#CC01200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453227600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Over the past five years, we have spent an enormous amount of time on statements such as these.\u00a0 In addition to post-Council statements, which have been held for decades, we have had the extra opportunity to each speak for ten minutes before summits.\u00a0 However, if one looks back on the record, one will find that the statements have been defined by the Government&rsquo;s refusal to share any information not already in the public domain and its failure to set out any coherent account of what Ireland's policy is towards the reform and development of the European Union.  In order to find out what our Government is saying on our behalf, we have had to rely on media reports and connections in other governments.  This matters because the Union continues to be faced with the most serious crisis in its history and direct threats to its core principles are stronger than ever and yet our Government is a bystander that waits to find out what will happen before trying to claim some level of credit for it.<\/p>  <p>  Control on national budgets is a major issue and when a new treaty was being discussed, the one and only request of our Government, according to the then President of the Council, was that whatever emerged should not have to be referred to the people.\u00a0 There was no proposal about fixing serious flaws in economic and monetary union or a proposal about helping regions in trouble.\u00a0 Absolutely no suggestion was made that aid be given to countries carrying debt linked to failed European policies.  On issue after issue in the past five years, the policy of saying as little as possible has been seen.<\/p>  <p>  The only proactive policy in Europe has been a public relations strategy at home designed to reinforce the Government fairy tale about its own actions.  An enormous amount of effort has gone into distorting the reality of how many decisions have been taken and to make patently false claims about how decisions have been reached.  Using the quite strong European freedom of information regulations, we have sought details of how or when our Government set out demands for any relief from bank-related debt or attempted to implement any of the major changes in policy that Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised in 2011.\u00a0 There was nothing there.  The D&aacute;il was told that the Taoiseach bravely stood up to the leaders of France and Germany, who may or may not have had two pints in their hands at the time, but the record shows nothing of the sort.<\/p><p>While Fine Gael and the Labour Party already claim to have \"won\" major interest concessions, the record shows that concessions negotiated by others were automatically extended to Ireland without any negotiation.\u00a0 In fact, the major decrease in debt service costs was four times what the Taoiseach had requested.  He will remember when he and his Ministers showered praise on themselves for a supposed \"game changer\" on bank related debt.\u00a0 The Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform said we might receive up to &euro;30 billion.\u00a0 I remember it well.  It was in 2012.  In the end, we have received exactly nothing, the same amount for which we asked.<\/p> <p> The bluster and rhetoric with which we have had to put up have failed to cover up a serious policy failure.\u00a0 At a time of great danger for the European Union, standing on the sidelines and focusing on national politics make us part of the problem - a timid Union that is scared to stand up to its opponents and unwilling to show the urgency or ambition which its citizens so badly want to see.  In this, the Government has abandoned 40 years of precedent.\u00a0 It is the first Government to end its term having failed to express a concrete opinion on reform of the European Union.\u00a0 In the past, Governments of all parties set out their vision for the Union and how it might develop.  In discussing possible changes to EU treaties every previous Government set out a public negotiating position, lobbied for it and, when it was agreed to, published a detailed statement on how Ireland's interests were impacted on by the proposed changes.  It is undeniably true that the Taoiseach has had meetings with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and Chancellor Merkel.\u00a0 He appears to get on well with both.\u00a0 Equally, however, there is no evidence of any concrete outcome for Ireland from these meetings, again, unlike many previous Taoisigh who built strong relations and showed important progress had been made on Ireland's interests.  Ireland was always a country which prided itself on not being afraid to speak up on important issues.\u00a0 We must return to this tradition because it is the single most important reason we have succeeded in shaping so many policies.  It is why, even in the midst of the economic crisis in 2009, other states invited us to chair the OSCE and why they have supported us in many international efforts such as our initiatives on non-proliferation and banning cluster bombs.<\/p> <p> The most recent summit addressed a list of vital questions and delivered little progress.\u00a0 It was a dispiriting outcome.  The item which took the most time to deal with was migration.\u00a0 Incredibly, it focused purely on border control as a means of controlling migration to Europe.\u00a0 This fundamentally ignores the reality of why so many have tried to come to Europe and from where they have come.  It is wrong for people to dismiss the idea that this scale of migration of people with no resources and links with European countries is not a problem.\u00a0 The countries that are hosting the greatest numbers are feeling undeniable pressures which must be recognised.  However, let us never forget that this is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis which has become a migration crisis.  People are making treacherous and often fatal journeys because they believe they have no alternative.\u00a0 They were driven out of their homes by a combination of a regime which was determined to prevent democracy and a fundamentalist army which was determined to impose mediaeval barbarity.  In refugee camps they have found places which offer no future and worsening conditions.\u00a0 While the European Union has increased its humanitarian assistance, it has been a fraction of what is being into proposals on border controls and aiding people after they have felt the need to flee the camps.\u00a0 In addition, the budget of the United Nations and other relief agencies has been squeezed.  Food is inadequate, shelter is poor, education for children is rare and employment opportunities are impossible.  The first priority must be the provision of humanitarian aid.  However, the Taoiseach and his colleagues appear to have done nothing but note past decisions at the end of their meeting.  <\/p> <p> Many of the migration proposals agreed to are reasonable, as are the proposals on combating terrorism.\u00a0 However, it is the duty of leaders not to succumb to the nasty populism of those who seek to spread fear and label innocent people with the deeds of a tiny minority which lack any legitimacy to speak on their behalf.  We must never forget that others refused to blame and label us for the murderous and sectarian brutality of the Provisional movement.\u00a0 We must stand with the Muslim community against the rising intolerance and overt racism of many extremists in Europe.  <\/p> <p> European values face a far bigger threat from the far right and Russian-inspired autocracy than they do from any other source, but the summit's communiqu&eacute; is disturbingly silent on Russia's invasion and partition of a sovereign European country and its continued attempts to destabilise it.\u00a0 Ukrainian democracy remains fragile.\u00a0 It will be difficult for it to survive if it cannot show that it can marshal continued support for its sovereignty.  I hope that in the coming weeks the media will take a break from discussing the political process and allow us to have a debate about issues such as this where the gaps between parties are becoming wider.  The support some of our representatives in the European Parliament are giving to the invasion and partition of Ukraine deserves to be exposed.<\/p> <p> The basic structure of EMU remains unsteady and the need for reform is undeniable.\u00a0 Therefore, the bland discussion held at the summit is worthless.\u00a0 New proposals may emerge in June, but how they might help remains a mystery.\u00a0 So far nobody has produced any justification for the claim that strengthened fiscal controls would assist growth and create employment.<\/p> <p> The discussion on the Single Market was somewhat more substantive.\u00a0 My party remains a supporter of the principle of freer and fairer trade.\u00a0 Ireland simply could not achieve decent standards of living without the security access to international markets provides.\u00a0 What we do not support is the idea that it should include measures which allow unfair competition against critical industries and the agrifood sector, in particular.  We also believe the Commission is in danger of wasting enormous time and resources in picking fights for the sake of being tough, rather than delivering meaningful competition improvements.  If one looks back at the Microsoft action, the Commission rejected arguments which turned out to be true concerning the transitory nature of technological dominance.  The increased competition in browsers did not come from litigation; it was part of the inherently disruptive nature of modern technology.\u00a0 In fact, if one looks back over the past 50 years, one will see a constant and natural process of companies winning and losing dominance in different markets.  Google, Apple and other major companies are always one significant development away from losing their edge and it would be a foolish person who said they could not be challenged.  I respect Commissioner Verstager who is a valued colleague of ours in the ALDE group.  Her aggressive agenda of seeking to open and fair competition for all should be supported.  However, I hope time and money will not be wasted in the pursuit of cases which may attract major attention but which will be of marginal benefit to European business.<\/p> <p> The summit noted the recent Paris agreement on climate change.\u00a0 As a fitting end to five years of moving away from ambitious action on climate change, the Taoiseach's speech in Paris has been rightly criticised by a wide range of experts and non-governmental organisations.  There are communities throughout the country which are experiencing at first hand the impact of the more frequent extreme weather with which climate change is linked.  I hope that after next month we will again have a Government which will show a genuine commitment to addressing a problem which requires a global solution but which has a very clear and growing national impact.<\/p> <p> The decision to postpone serious discussion of Great Britain's demand for changes in the European Union resulted from the fact that progress in the negotiations was more talked about than real.  The failure to have a national debate about what terms we would be willing to support to retain Great Britain in the Union is inexcusable.  It is clearly in our national interest for Great Britain to remain in the Union.\u00a0 It is also in the Union's interest.\u00a0 However, there has to be some limit.\u00a0 There has to be a point beyond which what is being asked for simply goes too far.  Nothing short of reducing the European Union to a hollowed-out and toothless free trade area would satisfy the English Eurosceptics.\u00a0 They even oppose the idea that a country should be subject to sanctions for breaking agreed rules.  Given what the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, has said, he will at least need agreement for some measures to be included in a future treaty, just as concessions for Ireland were included in subsidiary treaties rather than the main text of the Lisbon treaty.  Whatever is agreed to on 18 and 19 February will fall to the next Government to implement and the next D&aacute;il to agree to.<\/p><p>That is, of course, in the event that there is no referendum required and that if there is a change to the concept of freedom of movement and the respective powers of institutions, a referendum may be required.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach needs to know that he has no blank cheque.  He must defend Ireland&rsquo;s interests in a European Union which is capable of addressing core problems and a eurozone which can manage its own interests.  He should also be aware that any attempt by his staff to repeat for this summit the type of media manipulation on which they spend so much time will damage him and public support for whatever will emerge.<\/p> <p> If the UK referendum happens in June, it is Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s intention to lay out the case in Northern Ireland for it to remain as part of the European Union.  For the other jurisdictions which will be voting, it is up to them to assess what is in their best interests, but the case for Northern Ireland remaining in the European Union is overwhelming and we should not and will not be silent in the campaign.  This will apply, even if we are in the new Government the country so badly needs.  Having opposed EU membership, both North and South, and every single EU proposal in the South, Sinn F&eacute;in has chosen to join the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, in calling for Northern Ireland to remain in the European Union.  This is welcome.  I hope its hard Eurosceptic rhetoric of the past four decades will not have done too much damage.<\/p> <p> On the long list of items which the next Government will have to address urgently is a European Union in which there is no credible reform agenda which can deliver the social and economic progress citizens so urgently crave.  The case for shared rules which prevent a race to the bottom, the exploitation of employees and unfair competition for business is stronger now than ever, but its enemies on the right and the left continue to attack and undermine it.  It needs those who believe in the idea of shared progress to speak up and show urgency and ambition.  Ireland must stop standing on the sidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900031#DD00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453228800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I agree with some of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's opening remarks on this process.  It would be helpful in the next D&aacute;il, if we are returned, for us to know exactly what the Irish position is in many of the negotiations taking place.  If the Taoiseach were to impart that information, it would help the discussion we are having.  It would also be useful for the people at home who are listening to it.<\/p><p>I understand Britain&rsquo;s in-out referendum on membership of the European Union was discussed at the recent European Council meeting.  A new Survation opinion poll - apparently it is the British equivalent of Red C - published in the <i>Mail on Sunday<\/i>shows support among British voters for leaving the European Union rising to 53%, while 47% want to stay within it.  However, undecided voters were excluded from the count.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in firmly believes a British withdrawal from the European Union would represent a political and economic setback for Ireland and hinder the process of democratic transformation in the North.  On 29 January the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP Martina Anderson will hold a conference in Belfast on the referendum, as well as on the Tory plan to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998.  It is welcome that the Taoiseach at the recent Council meeting raised the economic, social and political implications a Brexit would have for Ireland.  There is support across the House on this issue.  As the referendum will allow the views of English voters to dictate the future relationship of the North and, therefore, the island as a whole with the European Union, has the Taoiseach ever raised with the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, the undemocratic nature of the referendum?  This is not just an issue for the North because people in Scotland and perhaos a majority in Wales have a similar view.  There is a rump in London that seems to be opposed to the European Union.<\/p><p>In D&aacute;il statements made before the Council meeting Deputy Gerry Adams said climate change was one of the defining challenges facing society and that while the Paris agreement was a good step forward, it fell far short of what was needed to protect humanity from the growing environmental crisis created by our abuse of the planet and its natural resources.  We have seen some of its disastrous consequences in recent weeks with the devastating floods that have affected the island and its people.  The agreed conclusions to the meeting state the Commission and the Council will review the results of the Paris conference in March 2016 and prepare the next steps.  Sadly, it is widely accepted that the State will not even reach the European Union&rsquo;s 2020 target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  This is a bit of a farce with developed countries buying off less developed ones.  It does not do anything to improve or save our planet.  We need to urgently review the State's commitment to reform in order to tackle climate change and reverse its current inaction because we are rapidly running out of time.  We need a plan.<\/p><p>More than 1 million refugees arrived in the European Union last year by land and sea.  It is the biggest crisis of forced displacement since the Second World War.  I raised the issue at the pre-Council meeting discussion.  One of the primary responses of the European Union was an agreement to resettle 160,000 refugees from Italy and Greece.  Considering the scale of need and the crisis, this was seen as a shockingly low number, yet to date only 322 refugees have been resettled.  I raised this issue personally with the Taoiseach after the debate.  There is something radically wrong when only 322 refugees have been resettled across the European Union.  In contrast to the slow pace of joint projects, EU countries have taken snap unilateral measures, including border lock-downs in the heart of the Schengen free travel zone and tighter asylum laws in Denmark, Germany and Sweden.  While the current EU President, the Netherlands, is shepherding the process, the next EU President, Slovakia, which will takes over in July wants to tear down the 160,000 person relocation scheme and has lodged a case against the plan at the European Court of Justice.  We are in the middle of one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world and the European Union is simply failing to act in a unified manner and is making the position worse.  The State has been asked to take in only 20 refugees under the programme.  What is the failure here?  What is wrong with the system?  Ireland agreed to accept 2,600 refugees.<\/p><p>Some aid agencies are reporting that many new arrivals are reluctant to apply for asylum in Greece or Italy, a prerequisite for entering the relocation scheme, either because they fear they will be stuck in these countries or because they do not wish to move to certain EU member states.  That is understandable considering the hostility in some states shown to people from different backgrounds.  What solutions to this problem did the Taoiseach propose at the Council meeting?  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dara Murphy, might reflect on this and give us some more information in his response. <\/p><p>The International Organization for Migration has stated 31,244 migrants and refugees have arrived in Greece by sea since the start of the year - 21 times more than in the same period last year.  The organisation states projections indicate the number of arrivals in Greece in 2016 &quot;may significantly exceed&quot; last year's record figure of 853,650.<\/p><p>There is a general acceptance that this crisis is not going away.  Many European politicians, particularly those on the right, want to close their eyes and somehow wish away this problem or are seeking to shift the problem onto the shoulders of others.  There is a lack of solidarity with those countries on the front line, particularly Greece and Italy.  Their solutions are not grounded in reality.  We need to act with unity in providing these refugees and asylum seekers the protection and support they need.<\/p> <p> In addition to the asylum seeker relocation programme, the Government has committed to taking in 520 refugees under a UNHCR programme.  According to reports, 176 refugees entered this State in 2015 under this programme and yet the Government has committed to receiving 4,000 people under relocation and resettlement programmes by the end of 2017.  How many refugees does the Minister of State expect Ireland to accept in 2016?  There was widespread support across the State but the process seems to have dragged on.  At one point, thousands of people were offering accommodation but we do not seem to be following up on that.  <\/p> <p> It is a pity the Taoiseach has had to leave the Chamber, as I now wish to raise the issue of Turkey.  For months, the Turkish army has been running an operation, with special police forces, of unprecedented violence against towns located in Kurdish regions of the country.  Some 10,000 soldiers, supported by tanks and helicopters, have been mobilised for this offensive which virtually turned the country's south-eastern region into a war zone.  The repression has escalated further in urban areas of the region, reaching a level unprecedented since 2002, with more than 50 curfews in 18 Kurdish cities and districts.<\/p> <p> Elected representatives, including from the HDP which received more than 10% of the votes during the last legislative elections, have been particularly targeted as well as more than 1,200 academics and lecturers who signed a petition denouncing these operations.  A well-known human rights lawyer, o El&ccedil;i, was assassinated recently.<\/p> <p> This violence, affecting more than 1 million people, has already led to the exodus of more than 200,000 inhabitants from the region.  The conflict's main victims are civilians, with 360 killed as of 13 January, including 61 children and 73 women.<\/p> <p> In his speech, the Taoiseach spoke about Turkey being an important partner but our partner seems to have gone rogue given what is happening in that region.  Does the Government have any concerns about the Turkish Government's approach to its large Kurdish population?  It does not seem to be within the framework of any rule of law, including Turkish law, including respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights.<\/p> <p> Would the Minister of State not agree that indiscriminate military operations and the systematic use of curfews represent an unacceptable collective punishment?  During this window of opportunity, will the Taoiseach raises these issues, including the tactics used in Turkey, with his Turkish counterpart?  The Minister of State might have an opportunity to do so also.<\/p> <p> Turkey is also included among what the EU is calling \"safe countries of origin\", which allow the asylum application process to be streamlined and applicants returned to their country of origin faster.  People have concerns about Turkey&rsquo;s inclusion on this list.  Turkey does not meet any of the criteria, especially that of a fair application of the law within a democracy, into addition to concerns over the ongoing persecution, torture and violence that the state is conducting.  Some 23.1% of people who left Turkey to claim asylum have a well-founded application.  Those figures raise concerns.  That is a huge number for a country of so-called \"safe origin\".<\/p> <p> I note that once again, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was not raised at this Council meeting.  It seems that this issue, including the huge suffering of the Palestinian people, has for whatever reason dropped off the EU agenda.  Since the last EU statement on the conflict in July 2015, Israel has advanced 2,410 new housing units for illegal colonial settlements.<\/p> <p> Peace Now, an Israeli NGO, says that the Israeli government is planning to build 67,000 more illegal settlements.  Will the Taoiseach and his Department raise these concerns as the prospects of creating a two-state peace process are disappearing?  Will the Taoiseach ensure that Israel and Palestine will be discussed at the next European Council meeting in February?  In the final days of this Government, will he abide by the motions passed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, and in line with the wishes of the vast majority of Irish people, to formally recognise the state of Palestine?<\/p> <p> Tens of thousands of Polish citizens have taken to the streets in protest at the alarming anti-democratic measures of the new government there.  Does our Government have concerns about that?  The new Polish Government has taken control of public TV, radio and print media by firing previous directors.  I am worried about the direction in which some European countries are going.  Has that matter been raised at meetings with our European counterparts?<\/p> <p> Those are some of the concerns I have.  It would be helpful if Ireland's position on many such issues was clearly outlined.  We should be told whether such arguments were made and if they were successful.  We should not have to trawl through records to try to discover the Irish position.  We should know exactly what the Irish position is on these issues when they arise, including what we said and argued for.  That would reassure people at home, especially those who are sceptical about the direction in which Europe is going.  Many people in Ireland would like to see Europe moving in a far different direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900033#FF00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453229400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>The next speakers are Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy Mick Wallace who are sharing time.

During the lifetime of this D&aacute;il, we have argued with our Government that it would be good to put a lot more effort into working for peace and taking a neutral position, rather than taking sides in wars and facilitating the American war machine.<\/p>  <p>  Some years ago, Europe had a more neutral position in terms of what was happening internationally than it has at present.  I find its approach to many things now is worrying.  Europe's failure to address the Palestinian issue has been evident for a long time.  The manner in which we have dealt with Saudi Arabia is also worrying.  This month, 47 people were executed in Saudi Arabia, 43 of whom were beheaded.  I do not remember hearing any protest by our Government or other western governments about that but maybe I missed it.  What Saudi Arabia is doing is similar to what ISIS does.  God knows, people are right to condemn the barbaric nature of ISIS but I wish they would also condemn the barbaric nature of Saudi Arabia in much of what it does.  <\/p>  <p>  The current war in Yemen is really worrying and what is occurring there is absolutely terrible.  Every human rights body on the planet has condemned what Saudi Arabia and the US-Britain supported coalition is doing there.  The Minister of State probably does not remember but a few weeks after Obama was awarded the Nobel peace prize, he ordered a cruise missile strike in Yemen complete with cluster bombs.<\/p><p>It ended the lives of 35 women and children, none of whose humanity was acknowledged in virtually any western media reports.<\/p> <p> Last year the marketplace in Fayoush in Yemen experienced a massive airstrike that killed at least 45 civilians, wounding another 50.  We can be sure that none of the victims was profiled in western media.  Their names were not mentioned.  No television network interviewed their grieving families.  We never learnt about their extinguished life aspirations or the children turned into orphans.  There was no Twitter hashtag in memory or support of them.  This was an horrific bombing and there have been many others.  Given that the war started only last March, to date just under 3,000 civilians have been killed by airstrikes supported by the US, Britain and Saudi Arabia - the so-called coalition, along with support from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.<\/p> <p> I do not understand why we do not have a position on this.  Are we okay with it?  The statistics coming out of Yemen are striking.  Along with the Saudi coalition&rsquo;s bombing campaign, American warships have also helped to enforce a naval blockade.  According to the UN, this collective punishment has left the country on the brink of famine, with desperate shortages of food, medical supplies and fuel which is used for pumping increasingly scarce water from the depths of the country&rsquo;s depleted water tables.  To the best of my memory it has a population of approximately 27 million people.  Four out of five Yemenis are now in need of humanitarian assistance and we have very little to say about it.  Europe has very little to say about it because Saudi Arabia is a friend of the US.<\/p> <p> What kind of credibility do we have if we will not call a spade a spade?  We are right to condemn the atrocities of ISIS, but why are we not condemning the atrocities of Saudi Arabia?  Last year the Saudis bought 22,000 bombs from the Americans at a cost of $1.2 billion.  They are cluster bombs in nature.  This afternoon I watched a scary video showing how they work.  People should look at it because the way they spread and target multiple areas is barbaric.  One dropped from an aeroplane can hit ten or 12 buildings at a time.  It is horrific.  The Minister of State should watch it to bring home the barbarity of it all.<\/p> <p> In 2014, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation visited Saudi Arabia.  After the meeting the Taoiseach said, \"I congratulated Saudi on their leadership in terms of moderation here in the Gulf region and their desire for a peaceful situation on a lot of very complex and technical issues.\"  The Taoiseach also said that he raised the issue of human rights by offering his congratulations to the prince on being invited to the Human Rights Council of the United Nations.  My God, we are congratulating these people.<\/p> <p> I think people are starting to accept that the Turks represent a serious problem in the region given how they have been massacring the Kurds.  They have actually helped ISIS to develop.  ISIS uses the Turkish border like a sieve and Turkey is okay with it because its main concern is the Kurds and it is using this situation to obliterate as many Kurds as it can.<\/p> <p> When will people wake up to the fact that the Saudis are every bit as big a problem if not a bigger problem?  Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have helped fund ISIS and other extreme fundamentalist terrorist activities for a long period.  It is unbelievable that everyone is okay with that.  Some 16 of the 19 involved in the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York were from Saudi Arabia, but the Americans went and bombed Afghanistan and are still bombing it.<\/p> <p> We talk about atrocities.  How many people has ISIS killed since 2006?  Has it killed 10,000 or 100,000?  I do not know.  It is not more than 100,000 for sure.  Figures now show that the US military machine and the US and western forces have killed in the region of 2.1 million civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq alone since 2001.  Where is the terror coming from?  Who is causing the most terror?  Who is killing the most people?  Why can we not call the truth?  What is wrong with that anymore?  It is just horrific.<\/p> <p> The arms industry has never been in such a healthy state.  It is running out of cluster bombs and cruise missiles.  Shares in arms companies are increasing rapidly because so many arms are being used.  It is interesting that in President Obama's two election campaigns, the arms industry gave him more money than it gave his Republican opponents.  His four biggest contributors were the arms, pharmaceutical, oil and coal industries.  One gets nothing for nothing in this world and payback always comes.  If the US were not dropping bombs on people's homes and villages, the arms industry would not be doing very well.  It would not be making as many bombs, fighter planes and God knows what.  I wish to God Ireland would just call it as it is and tell the truth.  It is just too bad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900034#GG00300","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453230000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>The Government's abject failure to behave as a sovereign nation and put its stamp on a different type of foreign policy for the EU is incredibly disappointing for many people.  The EU is now complicit in the world being much more unsafe and unstable than it has been at any time previously.  Not only is Europe turning a blind eye, it is actually profiting from that.<\/p>  <p>  From the Taoiseach's earlier statement, it is quite clear that the Council meeting spent a considerable amount of time dealing with the so-called problem of refugees.  However, the reality is that the refugees have a European Union problem rather than the other way around.<\/p>  <p>  We all know it was a record-breaking year for people smugglers in Europe, making about &euro;5.5 billion from exploiting the misery of people fleeing from war.  Some 90% of refugees who manage get to Europe do so with the help, if one could call it that, of a smuggler, being exploited to the tune to the tune of &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,500.  We know the reports of the abuses, the kidnappings, the sinking of boats and the horrors endured on these journeys.  There is no secret about that horror and the people making the journey know they are putting themselves at risk at the price of their whole life's savings.<\/p>  <p>  Why are they doing it if they know the risks?  They are doing it because what they are escaping from is even worse.  Their families are being murdered.  Their homes are being annihilated and they are starving to death in some instances.  This is a consequence of western wars and invasions.  That is why they are fleeing.  The EU has set up a system whereby people cannot claim asylum in Europe without reaching Europe first.  They can only do it illegally and by putting themselves at the hands of smugglers and so on.  Many organisations have highlighted the EU's failure to operate a humanitarian visa system.<\/p><p>The EU's response, namely, the so-called war on smugglers which at one stage was going to launch military strikes against them, is going to be just as ineffective as the war on drugs and terror with the victims ending up being revictimised.<br\/><br\/>It is disgusting that the EU has moved back to the position of concentrating efforts on preventing and discouraging people from attempting to get into EU territory rather than dealing with issues such as humanitarian visas.  Why can this not be done?  Has the Government raised this at European meetings?  Small consular outposts could be created outside of the European Union in countries such as Libya.  Obviously, the routes migrants take change but the posts could be moved around with them.  At these posts, people could have their applications for asylum assessed and be issued with a humanitarian visa.  They could then get a boat or airplane into the EU rather than having to venture forward illegally.<br\/><br\/>Not only has the issue of humanitarian visas to be addressed but the Dublin regulation has to go.  We should be championing that.  It has been a disgusting provision which the Government has milked a little bit.  The Government should be pushing for an end to the closure of land borders as these are far safer for people than crossing the Mediterranean in a leaky boat.  I am interested to hear what was said on this matter at the Council.<br\/><br\/>Dealing with the people who end up here is only one matter.  We could be doing much better in this regard.  The key issue is what we are doing as a neutral State to raise the issue of western military interventions which are the ultimate cause for the scale of the crisis that is unfolding.  Has the Government pushed for an end to air strikes and other interventions?  Has it raised the issue that these matters need to be debated?  If it has not done so, why?  As a neutral country we should be raising the despicable role of Turkey, which has facilitated the growth of ISIS for its own opportunistic and strategic goals <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>Syria as well as having a role in the plight of the Kurdish population there.  Why is the Government not doing so?  I think I know the answer and Deputy Wallace has highlighted it.  It is because the Government is putting economic interests, trade deals and deals with these people above the human rights of others.  It is just not good enough.  It is not in the interest of the Irish people or those who support our neutrality.  The Government should be doing better rather than being an Uncle Tom to the EU which is ultimately playing that role to US imperialism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900035#HH00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453230600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Has the undemocratic nature of the Brexit been discussed with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron?<\/p>  <p>  To date only 322 refugees have been resettled, meaning these humanitarian schemes are clearly failing.

It is not for us to comment.  We are more than aware of the various break-ups of the UK with Northern Ireland and Scotland.  It is not for us to comment on how the different elements of the United Kingdom may or may not vote.  The reality is that there will be a referendum and all the people of the UK will have their say on it.  It is a decision for the people of the United Kingdom to make.  Of course, what comes following that and how different parts of UK will vote will be part of the debate that will take place after the vote.  Our position remains absolutely categoric, however.  We want the people of the United Kingdom to vote to stay in the European Union.  We believe it is fundamentally in their own best interests.  Clearly for Ireland, it is the case that we will be the most affected outside of the UK should it vote not to remain in the EU.  It will also affect all the member states as well as the European Union itself.<\/p>  <p>  On the question raised by Deputy Clare Daly about the number of people who have come into the country so far for both resettlement and relocation, it is fair to say, particularly with respect to relocation, that the pace across the European Union has been disappointing.  Between both measures, we have committed to bringing in 4,000 people to Ireland.  To date, only with respect to resettlement, we have not seen any significant numbers.  We are optimistic, however.  We have people located in the hotspots trying to assist and ensure a significant number of people will come through to this country over the next couple of months.  With respect to resettlement, which is coming from outside, I must correct a point made by Deputy Clare Daly.  It is possible for people to apply for asylum outside of the European Union.  That is our preferred way for people to come in.  We hope, under resettlement over the next few months, to see more people, again in the hundreds, coming to this country.  We accept the points raised by the Deputies that the system is nowhere close to being as efficient as it should be.  The European Union collectively needs to ensure the target of achieving 160,000 people, who can come properly into the European Union through both measures, starts to happen quickly.<\/p><p> With respect to the Deputy's question about Turkey, on which Deputy Wallace commented, we must remember that Turkey is a very important partner for the European Union, especially in the current context of the migration crisis.  Notwithstanding some of the criticisms, we must continue to work with Turkey.  An EU-Turkey joint action plan, agreed on 29 November, is designed to help Turkey in providing for the refugees in its territory and also to prevent uncontrolled migration from Turkey across to the European Union.  There is a &euro;3 billion fund for supporting Syrian refugees who are based there.  Again, implementation of this will be key both for Turkey and the European Union.  There have been some positive moves since 29 November, including the opening of Chapter 17, which is with respect to Turkey's EU accession.  Many of the issues that have been raised and some of the concerns will be addressed through the various chapters of the ongoing Turkish accession negotiation.  Frans Timmermans, the First Vice President of the Commission, recently met the Turkish Ministers for foreign affairs and justice to discuss the need to speed up some of these measures, which will address some of the concerns that have been raised.<\/p> <p> With respect to comments made by Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, I would hazard a guess that they have not been discussed at Cabinet.  The Deputy will be aware that taxation remains a national competence in any event.  I am aware of the media reports about his comments with respect to various taxation measures, but I am not aware that it has been considered or discussed at Cabinet.  The Deputy will be aware that I am not a member of Cabinet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900036#JJ00300","speaker":"985","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453231200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Other Deputies wish to ask further questions.

On the summit and the Council meeting and the deal and discussions between the European Union and Turkey in terms of seeking to prevent people leaving the camps to travel to Europe, in the overall context has the Government a position on what is happening in Turkey?  The issues that are emerging are of growing concern.  There were bombs in Istanbul which killed nine tourists.  There has been a drift from essential democratic norms in a number of areas in terms of the Turkish Government applying pressure to independent media and a growing indifference to minority rights.  What was the contribution of the Irish Government or that of the Taoiseach to the summit in regard to those issues and what is the state of play in that relationship?<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the ongoing tensions between Turkey and Russia and the shooting down of a plane prior to Christmas which received global attention, was that discussed in any great detail at the summit?

We never really sought any debt relief and we have now closed the chapter in terms of seeking any debt relief in terms of Anglo Irish Bank, given that the European Union and the European Central Bank in particular were adamant that no bank should fail and that bondholders would not be burned.  That is what happened when Jean-Claude Trichet told the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that a bomb would go off and that it would not be in Frankfurt but in Dublin.

As the Deputy will be aware, the conflict between the Turkish Government and the PKK restarted in July 2015 when 180 civilians were killed.  We are aware there are some serious human rights concerns.  Ireland strongly condemns the horrific suicide terrorist attacks, the bombings in Ankara in October which killed 102 people and bombings in Istanbul where 12 people were killed this month.  The latest European Commission report on the accession process has noted a number of concerns, including with regard to significant shortcomings affecting the independence of the judiciary, as the Deputy mentioned, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and freedom of expression.  Ireland continues to raise concerns in this regard, including most recently at the Council of Europe in December and with our European partners, and there will be ongoing dialogue with Turkey.<\/p>  <p>  The question with respect to Russia was briefly discussed at the European Council.  My understanding is the Taoiseach did not contribute.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the Deputy's question on debt, I have attended this House over the past year and a half and the Deputy consistently seems to forget that the terms of the bailout that was negotiated by his party's Government, the promissory note being one example, would have cost many tens of billions of euro more than is currently the position with the renegotiation of the terms, the extension of the maturities, the extension of the terms of many of the loans and the reduction of interest rates.  By any objective analysis, having regard to the work that was done with the troika programme given the disastrous economic position in which this country was left, it is clear that the Government, especially the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, worked very effectively with our European partners to identify ways for the fiscal position of this country to be where it is.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is still a small gap of less than 3% between what this country collects in income and what we spend, but the Deputy will remember when that when his party was last in government this country economically was on its knees.  When he brings up the issue of the fiscal position of this country at this stage at the end of the Government's term of office, he would do himself great credit to acknowledge the extraordinary journey this country has made over the past five years under the stewardship of the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900037#KK00400","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1453231200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Will the Minister of State answer the question?

The Taoiseach said that I would focus on energy union and a forward-looking climate policy.<\/p><p>As expected, the European Council discussions dealt with both the historic agreement reached in Paris on climate change and the legislative package needed to advance the energy union project, which had been endorsed by energy Ministers in November.<\/p> <p> It is worth welcoming again in this House the new Paris agreement, which sets the framework for a truly global response to the enormous challenge of climate change.  The December meeting of the European Council gave a clear endorsement of this achievement and rightly congratulated France in particular for its presiding role in COP21.  The European Council agreed to request an assessment of COP21 and the next steps in light of the 2030 climate and energy framework in particular.  The Commission, with the Council, will prepare this in advance of the European Council next March.  There are 196 signatories to the Paris agreement.  It is both ambitious and legally binding and puts all countries in a position to take significant action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience.  All actors and all stakeholders, from the private sector to citizens to civil society, can clearly see that governments are serious about the challenge of global warming and about taking the necessary steps to confront it together.<\/p> <p> Collectively, we are now committed to keeping the rise in global temperature to well below 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and also to keeping the more stringent target of below 1.5&deg; Celsius in sight.  The agreement strengthens the financial and technical supports necessary for the most vulnerable countries and, crucially, through its transparency mechanism, ensures that each country can have confidence in the others' progress.<\/p> <p> We can be proud that Ireland played a key part within the EU&rsquo;s very effective negotiations in Paris.  In the coming months, the EU will look at how each member state will contribute to achieving our collective obligation as set out in the EU climate and energy targets for the year 2030.  I want to recall once again that Ireland has been clear and consistent in wanting a fair and achievable target that does not place a disproportionate burden on any one country but allows every country to play its part.<\/p> <p> As expected, the December European Council encouraged swift implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s energy strategy as set out in the energy union package.  The goal of this package is to achieve an energy resilient Union with a forward-looking climate policy.  To achieve this, the energy union encompasses a wide range of policy areas, including climate, transport, industry, research, the digital economy and agriculture.  We in Ireland strongly support energy union.  As a poorly interconnected member state, it is critical for us that we diversify the routes and sources of our energy and put in place appropriate supporting infrastructure.  Regional co-operation will assist us in achieving EU-wide market integration and will further contribute to unlocking the full potential of renewables.<\/p> <p> In the discussions at the December European Council, several member states raised the proposed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which would create a second direct link from Russia to Germany.  The Commission is considering the proposal and will give its opinion in due course.  Under the energy union legislative framework, member states will be required to produce national energy and climate plans by 2019.  By definition, these plans will be closely linked with work on achieving the EU&rsquo;s targets for 2030 under the climate and energy framework.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act has set work in progress on the development of a national mitigation plan and a national adaptation plan.  The launch of our new White Paper on energy sets the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low carbon economy and society by 2050 and aligns fully with the principles set out in the energy union strategy.

I also thank the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for attending.<\/p>  <p>  I have been living in Lucan for approximately 30 years, and in very close proximity to one of the finest schools in Ireland, namely, St. Mary's girls' national school, also known as Scoil Mhuire, which is in the process of being denied its promised and long overdue building refurbishment works that have been progressing through all the stages of the procedure for many years.  When the school was finally included in the schools stimulus package 2013, there appeared to be some glimmer of light, and for a number of years St. Mary's navigated its way through the protracted planning process.  When I met the school principal, Mrs. Mary McIvor, before Christmas, she was pleased to confirm to me that building was scheduled to begin in February 2016, just a few short weeks away, and to conclude in late autumn 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Last Thursday the entire project and all of the works undertaken, such as the inclusion in the schools stimulus package and the steady progress through the planning process, was thrown up in the air.  The principal was told by officials in the Department that it has emerged that there is a competition for resources between one school and another or others and that the promised funding may not now be forthcoming.  That is nothing short of disgraceful.  We have told the people that things are better and that we have the fastest growing economy in Europe, yet we deny our children the basics in this school.  The children have been advised through their parents to wear warm clothes because much of the heating system is no longer working.  The building is in an unacceptable level of maintenance.  In addition to the heating system not working, prefabs are still in place, windows are leaking and new and more acceptable bathroom facilities are required with drying facilities.  The new build will solve all those ills and bring an end to the altogether unacceptable working environment for the children and staff alike.  The school has never even benefited from additional and necessary works.  In spite of that and the best efforts of departmental officials to cause confusion if not deny the vital capital works, Scoil Mhuire, St. Mary's girls' national school in Lucan, continues to provide a wonderful educational experience for its 680 children.<\/p>  <p>  When the school principal could not contain this alarming news and felt duty bound to advise the board of management and the parents&rsquo; association, many of them contacted me last Thursday evening.  I was inundated with e-mails, text messages and phone calls from concerned and, understandably in some cases, angry parents because a departmental official cast doubt over the building project and conveyed the message that funding for the proposed development may not now be available.  At this very late stage of the proceedings and in the simplest terms, that is unacceptable.  As the local Deputy I am at one with the principal, the board of management, the teaching staff, the parents&rsquo; association, the parents and the children - our future - in their anger and upset at setting at nought all of what the Government has said previously.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I ask the Minister to provide clarity and certainty on St. Mary's girls' national school, Scoil Mhuire, Lucan, to confirm that the funding is in fact in place for the long outstanding and, by now, very necessary works, and to say when the works on St. Mary&rsquo;s school will commence.

Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by an additional 25,000 pupils by 2017 and they are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak in 2019.  To meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of the new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that significant capital funding will be invested in the education system through the Government's capital programme announced on 29 September last.<\/p><p>Over the next six years, &euro;3 billion in direct funding will be invested in the schools capital programme.<\/p> <p> The building project at Scoil Mhuire was one of a number of projects included in the investing in infrastructure and jobs stimulus package which, as the Deputy has just said, was announced in June 2013.  As part of this announcement, my Department committed to advancing these school projects, including Scoil Mhuire, to completion.  The project will provide an extra three classrooms to enhance the school to a 24-classroom facility.  Additionally, it will provide major refurbishment to the existing school.  This refurbishment element of the project represents a significant and increased investment by the Department and will provide state-of-the-art facilities for close to 700 pupils.  The project encountered a number of delays in the course of architectural planning.  Scoil Mhuire and St. Joseph's college share the same site which, at 6.18 acres, is very tight.  This resulted in the need for additional feasibility studies on the utilisation of the site ahead of the project.  In addition, the project also endured the loss of a member of the design team who left the project, adding further delay.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, the project was authorised to proceed through the tender process in the course of 2015.  The design team's supplementary tender report was submitted to the Department in December 2015 and has been considered by my Department.<\/p> <p> I became aware of the issues Deputy Keating refers to.  I had a phone call from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and contact from Deputy Joanna Tuffy at the weekend.  Deputy Keating was also in touch with my office.  I am aware of the concerns in the local community.  As the Deputy may be aware, in the management of a capital programme, it is necessary to review periodically the scheduling of construction projects within the overall programme.  This is a standard procedure, especially at the beginning of the year of the programme.  In this context, my Department is conducting an expenditure profiling exercise to determine when projects can advance to site.  When the expenditure profiling is complete, the Department will be in contact with Scoil Mhuire on the further progression of the project.  I want to alleviate any fear that there is some kind of competition going on between schools - that is not the case.  This is a procedure with regard to expenditure profiling and as soon as it is done - it will not take long - we will be in contact with the school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900038#LL00400","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453232400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister sincerely.

This is an extremely sensitive issue and, with the greatest of respect, I am unhappy with the Minister's reply.

I will focus on the Cork region.  I have said to the Minister before that there is a chronic lack of spaces for students with autism in ASD special classes attached to mainstream post-primary schools in the Cork area.  At present, there are five mainstream post-primary schools that provide special classes.  Nagle community college has two classes catering for 12 students; Deerpark has six classes catering for 36 students, which will be reduced this year to four classes catering for only 24 students; North Monastery on the north side has three classes catering for 18 students; St. Vincent's has three classes catering for 18 students; and Ursuline secondary school has one class catering for six students.  Unfortunately, as the Minister is aware, a place in each of these special classes only becomes available when an existing student graduates.  This is inadequate to meet the current demand for available places.  For example, Nagle community college's ASD programme steering committee will very shortly meet to decide upon their enrolment next year.  It can only pick four students because only four of its students will graduate.  Only four places will become available, yet it has a list of 15 students - 12 boys and three girls.  This means 11 students who were in special classrooms at primary level will not be able to avail of that at post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  The sad thing is that the girls might possibly get a place in St. Vincent's or Ursuline's but for the 12 boys there is no other option because the remaining schools with ASD special classrooms at post-primary level will not enrol anyone next year.  Deerpark and North Monastery will not take any students into their special classes next year.  In 2016, there will only be four places in special classrooms and ASD classrooms in the whole of Cork city offered to boys with special needs.  In 2017 - we know these figures - there will be no places available.  In 2018, there will only be one place available.  In the past, to try to address this, the local special educational needs officers, SENOs, have asked each of the post-primary schools to look at establishing a special ASD classroom.<\/p><p>To date, only one school in the Cork region, namely, Ursuline secondary school, has taken up that request.  No other school has taken up the recommendations from the local special educational needs organisers, SENOs.<\/p> <p> There are 15 autism spectrum disorder-specific classes in Cork city but as I stated, two of them will cease this year, thereby reducing the number to 13.  If one considers the number of students attending primary school who hope to graduate into post-primary education, there are 66 classes at primary level, which contain 396 students in total, but yet in the entire Cork region there are only 34 classes that cater for 204 places.  As 396 students will never go into 204 places, there always will be a chronic shortfall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900039#MM00500","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453233000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I share his interest in this area.  As he has just noted, the SENOs engage with schools and work with them to provide the necessary places.  I first will outline the position with regard to children with autism.  The Deputy is aware the Government is committed to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes, which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions delivered by fully-qualified professional teachers with the support of special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  Children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  The Deputy also will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible through its network of local SENOs for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism.  It also is the role of the NCSE to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.  SENOs engage with schools annually to plan for and to open new special classes each year to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post-primary school level to meet demand in a given area.  Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of special educational needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1.5 at post-primary level and with SNA support.  I believe all Members are agreed this is a good option for them.  Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements, there are more than 1,000 special classes nationwide at primary and post-primary level, of which 762 are for children with autism.  A total of 194 of these classes for children with autism are at post-primary level, which represents an increase of 27% on the previous school year.  However, I acknowledge the issue raised by the Deputy pertains specifically to the post-primary area and to Cork.  Nevertheless, progress has been made and the SENOs and the NCSE are engaging with schools on a regular basis to try to increase the willingness of schools to take on such special classes.<\/p>  <p>  As for the requirement for post-primary school places for children with autism, the NCSE, through its network of local SENOs, will engage with schools for the 2016-17 school year to plan for and to open new special classes to ensure there are sufficient placements available to meet demand in an area.  The NCSE also will allocate staffing resources to special schools to provide for the number of pupils enrolling for that year, while taking into account the disability categorisation of those pupils and in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0042\/2011.  Details of all of the special classes for children with special educational needs that are attached to mainstream schools are published each year on the NCSE website.  I acknowledge there is a tight timeframe in respect of the forthcoming school year and that the Deputy is specifically raising the issue of post-primary provision in the Cork area.  The SENOs are engaging regularly with schools and I recognise the Deputy is raising a fairly urgent issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900040#NN00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1453233000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I recognise there has been a statewide increase of 27% in the provision of places but unfortunately quoting that figure does not reflect the reality on the ground in certain geographic areas and I have provided the Minister with the example of Cork.  At present, the closure of two classes in the Cork region is anticipated although I have been unable to confirm why it is proposed to close those classes, which cater for 12 students.  Incidentally, that is the exact number of students who will be left without a place in post-primary special classes.  While I have been given reasons off the record, I have been unable to confirm them and it would not be right to put them on the record here.  Perhaps the Minister can check this out with the school itself, namely, Deerpark Christian Brothers School in Cork city.<\/p><p>The other issue is while I would be first to state the SENOs are active in engaging with the post-primary schools in the Cork area in trying to convince them to open special classes, unfortunately, as I stated in my opening remarks, only one school in Cork city has actually done this, namely, Ursuline secondary school.  There appears to be an opt-out clause or position schools can take and despite the evidence stating additional classes are needed, schools are not taking that on board.  I do not know the reasons behind this but surely, as Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister can speak to the schools or can make some form of directive.  Alternatively, if this is a funding issue, perhaps the Minister can revert and tell me this is why schools are not giving consideration to additional special classes.  However, one cannot have a situation whereby in the entire county of Cork, 396 sixth class students are finishing primary school and seek to get into special classes at post-primary level but only 204 places are available.  Moreover, this is not to mention the students who may be in special schools at present but who, with the additional help at post-primary level, may be able to transition from special schools into special classes in a mainstream setting.  This surely also should be the goal and it should not simply be about trying to maintain the<i>status quo<\/i>.  I acknowledge the timeframe is short but I ask the Minister specifically to look into the reason two classes are being lost at Deerpark Christian Brothers School.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900040#NN00300","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1453233000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy, I do not believe it is a funding issue.

When one considers Cork, its layout and its traffic infrastructure on the eastern side of the city, it is completely dependent on the tunnel in respect of traffic going from north to south.  Were anything to happen to that tunnel, there would be no access across the River Lee for the volumes of traffic currently passing through the tunnel on a daily basis.  It is proposed to spend sums of money in upgrading the Dunkettle roundabout to make it into a cloverleaf type of junction system, which is welcome.  However, the north ring road itself also should be prioritised as that would address Cork's current absolute dependence on the tunnel for its infrastructure and traffic movement.  This project should not be shelved when the north side of the city is both underdeveloped and poorly developed in respect of infrastructure and what it supports in attracting further industry and opening up areas for development.<\/p><p> As the Minister is aware, Apple is located on the north side of the city.  It is a huge employer and an international flagship company.  We want to be able to capitalise on that type of company locating in the heart of the north side of the city but the only way we can advance industry and commerce in the area is by developing a proper traffic route.  This requires the building of the north ring road from Killydonoghue on the eastern side to Poulavone in Ballincollig.  Anything short of that undermines the capacity of the city to develop on the north side.  There is an unequal balance between the two sides of the city in terms of investment.  This is patently obvious any day of the week; one needs only drive across the city.  There is an awful lot more development on the southern side than there is on the northern side in terms of both local authority investment and, as important, private investment.  The obligation on the Government is to ensure this road is constructed and developed.<\/p> <p> Linking our two great cities is the next piece of the jigsaw.  We must put the M20 back firmly on the map.  The north ring road in Cork and the M20 between Cork and Limerick are critical infrastructural developments.  These two great cities could create a counter-weight.  They would be two great cities coming together.  We do it regularly in rugby and we could also do it in many other areas.  We would have a corridor from Galway, south to Limerick and on to Cork.  These are three university cities which have an exceptional quality of life and are linked by rail and road.  There are deep water ports in Cork and Foynes and international airports in Shannon and Cork.  There is a huge opportunity for counter-balance and to develop the west and south west, which is important.  I do not want to be too parochial about it but we believe that there will be a retarding effect on growth and investment in the region if this infrastructure is not developed in the next number of years.  <\/p> <p> This infrastructure would open up the whole of the south west and west to investment opportunity in areas such as pharmaceuticals, as in Cork.  As one moves up along that length of the country towards Galway, where the medical device industry is to be found, there is huge potential for symbiotic development and cross-fertilisation of capacities in the various cities.<\/p> <p> The immediate step to be taken is the construction and development of the north ring road in order to ensure we are not dependent on the tunnel alone.  Then the M20 needs to be put firmly back on track.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900040#NN00800","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453233600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>While I share an interest in the Cork-Limerick road, I will confine my answer to the north ring road.  As I said, I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme.  The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, formerly known as the NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects such as the Cork north ring road is a matter in the first instance for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.  Ireland has just under 100,000 kilometres of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer.  Given the national financial position, there have been large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past number of years.  For this reason the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than major new improvement schemes.  The northern ring road was one of a range of proposed road development projects which had to be deferred.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, the economy is now recovering and the pressures we are now facing relate to renewed economic growth.  The Government's capital plan reflects the need to maintain a prudent approach to expenditure, the balancing of investment needs and the long-term sustainability of the national finances.  The transport element of the plan was framed by the conclusions reached in the Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  This report highlighted the importance of maintenance and renewal of transport infrastructure together with targeted investments to address, in particular, bottlenecks and critical safety issues.  The capital plan provides &euro;6 billion for investment in the roads network in the period to 2022, with &euro;4.4 billion earmarked for the maintenance and strengthening of the existing extensive network throughout the country and &euro;1.6 billion for new projects.<\/p>  <p>  While it will not be possible to address all the demands for improvement schemes over the next plan period, the plan does provide for the gradual build-up in capital funding for the road network towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works.  In this context a number of important projects in Cork are included in the plan, including the upgrade of the Dunkettle roundabout and the N22 road between Ballyvourney and Macroom.  In addition, the plan also provides that the N28 upgrade scheme will also commence subject to planning permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900041#OO00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1453233600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The Minister's honesty in the reply disappoints the object of my raising this particular issue.  We have to emphasise that this is not a regional or local issue.  It is a strategic issue in terms of the development of the second city.  We talk about access to the port, which it is proposed to move further down the harbour in Ringaskiddy, the opening up of the north side of the city for investment and development and ensuring that the city and the critical infrastructure around it is not fully dependent on the tunnel.  I can instance a few cases.  For example, we have a massive pharmaceutical base in the lower harbour and the intermediary harbour area.  We also have an airport in the south side of the city but most of its hinterland would be from the northern and eastern parts of the country.  The dependence on the tunnel, in the event of anything happening, would mean the economic life of the Cork region could come to a standstill for a period of time were the tunnel closed for whatever reason, be it an accident, damage to the tunnel or some other event taking place.<\/p>  <p>  If we had the north ring road linking the south link on the eastern side and moving across the north ridge to Killydonoghue on the M8, all these problems would be alleviated.  It would also alleviate the difficulty we will have in the next couple of years in the context of the Dunkettle interchange upgrade.  We will be piling more and more traffic into a system that simply cannot take it.  Our south ring road is like a parking lot at certain times.

However, she also said: <\/p><blockquote>It is very clear that every country makes its own legal arrangements for lawful interception.

It is, therefore, of fundamental importance that journalists be able to carry out their legitimate work unhindered.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns have been expressed in recent days on the question of access to the telephone records of journalists in the context of a criminal investigation being carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  Access to communications data is governed by the Communications (Data Retention) Act 2011.  I must emphasise that I do not have any role, nor does my Department, in the process of requesting or authorising access to telephone records or logs under the 2011 Act; nor do I receive information on specific requests made in the course of those investigations.  We have had many calls for strong, independent monitoring in various arenas and that is what we set up in GSOC.  It would not be appropriate, in the context of the independent functions of bodies such as GSOC, for me to have that kind of information.  It is an independent body which acts independently.  As the House will be aware, genuine concerns have, however, been raised about the balance in the current law between the important freedom journalists should rightly have to pursue legitimate matters of public interest and the basic right of persons not to have their personal information improperly disclosed.  This raises very complex issues.  We are talking about the various balances between, for example, criminal investigation, the public interest, protecting sources and the rights of victims.  These are fundamental issues for any society and democracy to manage in the best possible way.<\/p>  <p>  I went to the Government today and it agreed to my proposal to establish an independent review of the law in respect of access to the telephone records of journalists.  The review will cover all bodies that can have access to records under the Data Retention Act, including GSOC, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces.  The 2011 Act which was introduced by the former Minister Mr. Dermot Ahern in 2011 provides all of these bodies with that authority.  I am pleased that the distinguished former Chief Justice John Murray who was also a former member of the European Court of Justice has agreed to carry out the review.  I express my appreciation for his immediate agreement to conduct the review which I expect and anticipate will be completed in three months.  It is about looking at the issue and getting a speedy report on the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Murray will be examining whether further safeguards are necessary.  I have also asked him to look at the international situation.  The draft terms of reference for the review are to examine the legislative framework in respect of access by statutory bodies to communications data of journalists held by communications service providers, taking into account the principle of protection of journalistic sources, the need for statutory bodies with investigative and-or prosecution powers to have access to data in order to prevent and detect serious crime, and current best international practice in this area.  There must be clear criteria for accessing these records.  It must be in respect of a serious offence which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to five years.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to GSOC, in particular, while fully respecting the independence of the Ombudsman Commission, I was glad to meet this morning its chairperson, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring who was appointed by the Government some months ago and is a judge of the High Court.  She has assured me of the clear and strict procedures in place in GSOC in this area and that it is operating fully within the law.  She emphasised to me that GSOC requests for access to telephone records were decided at the level of the chairperson.  As the Deputies said, within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na there is a request from a superintendent which is decided at chief superintendent level.<\/p>  <p>  I have assured Ms Justice Ring - I emphasise this point to the House - that there is no question whatsoever of the review of the law in this area reflecting any lack of confidence in GSOC.  The review arises not from the facts of any particular case but from the genuine concerns raised about the overall balance of the law in this area.  While I am sure Deputies share my view that statutory bodies investigating offences need to have the appropriate statutory powers available to them to carry out their duties which are very important, we need to examine the balance in respect of entirely legitimate journalistic activity being carried out in the public interest.  That is what I envisage being done in the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900042#PP00300","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1453234800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I have to say the Minister's response is completely inadequate and off the mark.  The review of the 2011 Act in regard to journalists is not enough.  All citizens deserve to have their privacy and human rights protected, and the rightful outcry in regard to journalists' phones being intercepted should be shared in regard to other citizens' rights.  The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 allows the Garda to break into somebody's house, to plant devices, to carry out secret recordings and to put a tracking device on a person's car.  Some of these activities can be done on the say-so of a superior officer without any oversight or scrutiny, or any definitive figures being produced afterwards.  This is not good enough.  Privacy and human rights are deserved by all.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the situation regarding all of the surveillance legislation which is on our books, the use of that and the powers that rest with the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners, the Defence Forces and other State bodies which are not open to proper scrutiny or freedom of information requests.  It is not just a matter for GSOC.

I read a very good letter in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>this morning by Ray Leonard.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>I would suggest that any journalist aggrieved by GSOC&rsquo;s actions should make a complaint under section 109 of the 2005 Act and seek a review of those actions by a High Court judge.  I would be surprised if such a review found GSOC to have acted excessively but in the event that it did, then the public, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (and the journalists) have a right to know and to ensure that such actions are corrected.

In this instance, the most recent report was published in November 2015 by Judge Paul McDermott.  As Deputy Wallace rightly points out, there is an opportunity, if one has a complaint, to take it up, and there is an identified judge, Judge Hanna of the Circuit Court, who deals with complaints which are made in regard to any such access to records, if an individual has a complaint in regard to it.<\/p>  <p>  To take up Deputy Daly's point, the various bodies which are named in the 2011 Act will also be considered, as I have made very clear.  This is not just about GSOC but also about the access that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces have in regard to these powers.  This is included in the term of reference.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to again put on the record of the House that the purpose of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 is not to pry into the communications or privacy of individuals but to support the work of statutory agencies which are carrying out important work in investigating what have to be serious criminal offences - that is the criteria.  This clearly is a key factor in determining whether the decision is agreed to give access to those records.  I think most fair-minded people in this House would agree these powers are necessary; the question is what are the appropriate checks and balances.  That is precisely what I have asked the judge to review because, of course, we must have the strongest checks and balances possible in view of the importance of these issues.  There are balances, and I have mentioned the balance between privacy and criminal investigation, defending the public interest, the rights of victims and, of course, the rights of journalists to protect their sources.  These are the issues that will be taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  When we are considering the rights of journalists, I would make the point that we must also take into account the very legitimate rights of a person or their family not to have personal information put in the public arena.  We have to realise how very distressing it can be for individuals and families when information is leaked.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, this review will be carried out by the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Murray.  I believe this is a measured and responsible response to the issues raised, rather than rushing headlong into a legislative amendment.

I speak regularly to Deputy Burton and she is very courteous to me, as I am to her.  There is no animosity between the T&aacute;naiste and myself.  However, when they listen to what I have to say and to why I am angry and upset, many people may understand why this motion has been put forward.<\/p>  <p>  The practice of Government Ministers appointing party favourites to State boards and quangos before a general election is a long-standing and established tradition.  Fianna F&aacute;il, which has been quick to condemn the T&aacute;naiste in the wake of David Begg's appointment as chairman of the Pensions Authority, secured similar roles for 60 of its own supporters before it lost office in 2011, when Labour and Fine Gael promised us a new and very different type of politics that would challenge the political cronyism surrounding State board appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has always been a most vocal critic of political cronyism.  Back in 2004, when she was the Labour Party spokesperson on finance, she said she would vigorously oppose some proposals in the new Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill.  Addressing the D&aacute;il, she said she was particularly concerned that special advisers may be able to circumvent the rules on open, competitive recruitment.  She also said that public confidence must be maintained in the honesty and fairness of the public service recruitment system and she expressed grave concerns that political appointments would be made via the back-door route.<\/p>  <p>  Ten years later, in the wake of the McNulty debacle, the T&aacute;naiste was still speaking against political cronyism.  She claimed to the D&aacute;il that it was she who proposed a new process of appointments to State boards whereby Ministers choose from a short-list provided by the Public Appointments Service and she promised a system of appointments which would provide the best range and mix of people.<\/p><p>However, there was no range of people under consideration when she bypassed the normal appointment procedures to offer personally David Begg the Pensions Authority post, a role he has admitted he had not wanted and for which he did not apply.  Last week, on national radio, one of the T&aacute;naiste's own Labour Party Deputies asked why the rules are in place if we are not going to abide by them.<br\/><br\/>One of the most infuriating comments that has been made in recent days is the suggestion made by Mr. Begg himself that the &euro;20,000 a year role is not lavishly paid.  What an appalling insult.  I could fill this Chamber a hundred times over with pensioners, people on invalidity payments, people on disability payments, low-paid workers and the unemployed, all of whom earn less than &euro;20,000 a year.  What about single mothers who would be glad of an additional income of &euro;20,000?  These people know the meaning of a pittance, but David Begg does not.  These people are surviving on a pittance every week.  The T&aacute;naiste's behaviour in making this appointment, regardless of Mr. Begg's suitability for the post, flies in the face of all her promises of equity throughout her career.  I have cited some of the points she has made.<br\/><br\/>At present, I am handling several cases of homelessness among young single mothers in Waterford.  A major problem facing these young women and the issue driving them into homelessness is that the Government policy set down by the T&aacute;naiste's Department delays the payment of a deposit for a property for weeks or even months.  Even if these mothers could raise a deposit themselves, the current rent levels set by the Department for a single parent and child is &euro;475, despite the average cost of a two-bedroomed house in Waterford being &euro;700.  Can we not understand why people are homeless and being driven out onto the streets?<br\/><br\/>These young mothers are shunted off to bed and breakfast accommodation indefinitely and expected to lead a normal life without a proper kitchen or laundry facilities.  They have nowhere for their children to play and no hope of getting a home of their own.  They have no fridge in their room to store milk, not to mind food for their children.  They are living on sandwiches and takeaways and walking the town with their babies and toddlers each day in an effort to kill time as their children are not allowed to play outside their bedrooms.  This is a hopeless and horrendous situation for any parent to be in.  I estimate that my office has helped more homeless people in the past three months than in the entire first year I was in office.  This is largely due to the policy the T&aacute;naiste is standing over, while she appoints her buddies to comfy roles for what has been described as a pittance.<br\/><br\/>I am tired and worn out from meeting people in hopeless situations.  These people have no money, no food and no clothes for their children.  I work out of an office, part of which is used to provide breakfast to children each morning because they have no breakfast before going to school.  How would that &euro;20,000 fit with that family?  How would it fit with the thousands of families in poverty in Ireland?  The T&aacute;naiste can see why I am angry and upset.  Any Deputy in this House worth his or her salt must be experiencing the same problems of desperation, poverty and deprivation in this country.  However, the T&aacute;naiste has decided one of her buddies, who is retiring on a large pension, will be given more than what is given to an old age pensioner, somebody on social welfare, somebody on invalidity or somebody on disability, and he describes this as a pittance.  Is it any wonder people are upset?  The T&aacute;naiste should listen to any of the radio programmes broadcast today and listen to what people are saying when they ring in to them.<br\/><br\/>Whether David Begg is suitable for the job of chairing the Pensions Authority is not the question here.  What needs to be questioned is how the T&aacute;naiste can hold her head high and claim she has shown equity in making this appointment.  During her term as Minister for Social Protection, the rate of child homelessness has soared.  The policies of her Department during her term have flown in the face of our obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to guarantee every child a minimum standard of social protection.  Allowing the Minister to continue in this role and to continue, unashamedly, to endorse political cronies shows the worst form of contempt for the thousands of children whose lives have been devastated by the very policies she stands over.<br\/><br\/>I started off this debate by making the point that I hold no animosity towards the T&aacute;naiste.  She is very courteous to me and is a very nice person.  However, I live in the real world.  I live in a city that has had the highest rate of unemployment and subsequently one of the highest rates of poverty, deprivation and child poverty.  Therefore, I know what I am talking about.  I do not come in here and speak lightly on this.  I have never made a personal attack on any Minister or Member of the D&aacute;il.  However, I am furious now.  People have come to me and said they do not understand this.  Their social welfare or children's allowance or child benefit was cut and they cannot understand how we can give somebody who has a huge pension &euro;20,000 on top, the equivalent of what they are not getting.  This has resonated with people throughout the country today.<br\/><br\/>David Begg is not the issue.  I do not know whether he is suitable for the appointment.  The problem is that none of us knows because he did not have to go for interview or have to submit his portfolio to <i>stateboards.ie.  <\/i>He did not do that.  I am sorry to have to point this out.  I am comfortable with putting forward this motion.  This is not something I would choose to do, but I am doing it for the hundreds of thousands of people in need and the one child in ten who is going to school in the morning hungry and without proper clothing.  I am doing it for the 750,000 people in this country who, as any organisation can confirm, are on the edges of poverty, below the poverty line or about to go into poverty.  That is the reason for this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900043#QQ00800","speaker":"1094","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453235400,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I strongly support my colleague, Deputy Halligan.  It is important to look at the wording of this motion, that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  I will discuss this key phrase, \"social protection\", later.  Insiders have contaminated politics for many years.  Politicians of all parties have grossly abused their power.  I insist that they surrender the right to make political appointments.  This demand includes the end of the practice of parties in government putting their favourites on the boards of State bodies, into the Judiciary, the top ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Central Bank commission.  Independent bodies must be set up to exclude all politicians from the ranks of those making such choices.  Political patronage and cronyism must end.  That is what this motion is about and these are the key issues in regard to the broader debate.<\/p>  <p>  This debate is not just about one Minister, but includes the Government and other Ministers.  In recent days, we have seen a blatant display of cronyism.  This has contaminated politics.  We need to end the practice of political appointments.  We also need to develop and focus on selecting people with ability based on merit.  Ability and merit should be at the heart of all appointments.  Political patronage should end.  We have many highly talented people with expertise in our wider society.  People selected for these boards should be selected on merit.  The key words for this debate are merit and transparency.<\/p><p>It is about merit and ability, without cronyism.<\/p> <p> In the past 24 hours we have seen how three other Ministers or Ministers of State used this get-out clause to make appointments to top State posts.  The T&aacute;naiste bypassed the public process and the others involved are the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Ministers of State, Deputies McHugh and Nash.  The latter is here tonight.  We are talking about transparency versus cronyism and people in broader society deserve better.  We were promised a breath of fresh air and new politics in 2011.  Many of us on the doorsteps gave such a commitment following the crash and the leaders in that campaign were Fine Gael and Labour.  Where is this new type of politics?  Even the Government backbenchers are extremely unhappy about this issue.<\/p> <p> Not only are we saying we have no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste, we are also challenging the insiders in this House and across society.  We need to reinforce transparency by means of a proper and mandatory application and interview system, as is the case with every other job.  In most parts of society, if a person is going for a job, he or she does an interview after sending in a CV.  Independent experts usually supervise the allocation of the job, so why does it have to be different for people appointed by Ministers?<\/p> <p> There are wider issues of social protection.  Any vision from a Minister for Social Protection should contemplate protecting people, particularly the vulnerable in society.  Only last night we heard about bed bugs, mice and cockroaches.  There are 800 families in temporary accommodation.  We heard about leaking water, mould and faulty electrics.  This is not 1913 or the Lock-out.  This is 2016 in Dublin and the Labour Party should face that reality.  It is an absolute disgrace that young children are living in conditions like this when a Labour Minister is responsible for social protection.  Where is the social protection for those children?  Where is the support and care for those families?  One child in three in this country is deprived of basic necessities.  This fact was highlighted in the Growing Up in Ireland report in the context of the major inequality in Irish society.  The Ombudsman for Children has indicated that approximately 138,000 children are living in poverty.  Where is their social protection?  Consistent poverty rates have increased from 6.8% to 11.7%.  Where is the social protection in that?  It is predicted that 37,000 children will live in poverty by 2020.  Some 1,054 children are homeless at present and the rate is rising.  I am not speaking about just one Minister but rather a Government and its ethos or vision.  This is about the need for a radical vision that will bring real equality and rights for children.  We need real social protection.<\/p> <p> The European Anti-Poverty Network in Ireland stated in a recent report that 1.4 million people, or almost 31% of the population, suffered from deprivation.  A quarter of the population cannot afford to heat their homes adequately and 37% of children suffer deprivation.  The worst deprivation is felt by lone parents, the unemployed and people not at work because of illness or disability.  I will return to the disability issue later.  This is a stark reality but the Government wants to dip people's pockets time and again.  The numbers at risk of poverty, or those below 60% of median income, have fallen slightly, although they are still above the 2008 levels.  The numbers experiencing consistent poverty have doubled since 2008 to 8.2%.  The Government needs to remove almost 193,000 people from poverty and half the current number to meet its target of 4% for 2016.  These are the facts.<\/p> <p> The Government and mainstream political parties must ask where the money will be obtained and how services may be funded.  According to the Department of Finance, the top 1% or 21,650 earners have an annual gross income of &euro;8.7 billion, with the average earnings of &euro;403,703 per year.  That is more than ten times the average industrial wage.  According to the Revenue Commissioners' latest available statistics, corporate profits are increasing, with gross trade profits increasing to &euro;73.8 billion in 2011 from a previous figure of &euro;70.8 billion.  There is wealth in the country but there is a lack of emphasis in challenging those in possession of it.<\/p> <p> A very important element of social protection is the health of people living in disadvantaged areas.  We must target health policies and services in such disadvantaged communities.  We must put these people first as they have a complex social and medical need.  These people have higher rates of health-related problems and three times the mortality rates of more affluent patients.  Males die 18 years sooner than those in more affluent groups.  I raise that reality in the context of the broader motion.  We need social protection for our people and particularly our children.  We need social protection for the whole of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900044#RR00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453236000,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Shane Ross.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900045#SS00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1453236000,"counter":467,"content":"<p>An error was made when the names were sent.

There is no doubt it has transformed but elements have not transformed for the better.  I will draw attention to a few of them.  The &euro;70 million contract awarded to a UK company in respect of JobPath is absolutely outrageous.  The jobs are being created for UK staff to run the process and deliver what was recognised as a failure in the UK.  JobPath is already a wasteful disaster.  Much of the process relating to it amounts to box-ticking.  When the Minister announced JobPath she stated that it would provide intensive individual support, advice and coaching to all on the programme and that JobPath would also help participants to address social inclusion barriers, improve personal well-being and tackle personal difficulties such as problems with literacy, numeracy and addictions.<\/p>  <p>  I can tell the T&aacute;naiste that there is no advice or coaching being delivered.  The group CV workshops are not supervised and there is no work to overcome social inclusion barriers.  The only barrier I can see arises if somebody refuses to take on a training programme that is totally unsuitable.  There is no context to skill experience.  The provider has the brand new offices, signage and the &euro;70 million for the contract.  Each intervention with a jobseeker is charged to a contract and the jobseeker may often be forced into an unsuitable outcome.  There is no initiative to identify skill gaps or to have a targeted approach to fill such gaps with appropriate training.  For the life of me, I do not understand how when something has failed, we must persist with trying it again and seeing if it fails again.<\/p>  <p>  There have also been changes to pension calculations that are grossly unfair.<\/p><p>A woman came to my office last week who had paid in excess of 30 years worth of pension contributions and got a reduced pension.  When one compares that in terms of fairness to someone who has never worked before the age of 55 and works continuously until pension age, one sees that they get a full pension.  It is calculated on the basis of the very first payment a person makes.  If a person starts off as a student, takes time out to go to college, takes time out to look after children or other caring responsibilities or even takes a couple of years abroad, they can put themselves in a perilous position because it is calculated over all of their working life.  This is grossly unfair.  Increasingly, I am coming across people who are furious about that.  It is transformation alright but it is not transformation for the better.<\/p> <p> The third area I wish to speak to is the approach to rent assistance.  I began raising this with the T&aacute;naiste more than three years ago because I could see what was happening.  It was subsequently tweaked a bit but the problem that there would be an acceleration in the number of people who could not make up the difference and would end up homeless was evident.  There were improvements, certainly in the past year, when section 38 was more extensively used.  I used it a lot through my office.  If there is a risk of homelessness and there are particular circumstances, a case can be made to the rents unit.  This has now changed very significantly in places like Kildare where the HAP programme is being rolled out.  While there are merits in that programme, the section 38 element is being rowed back on.  For example, a single adult who attempts to rent a property will be allowed &euro;520 plus 20% over the cap.  This is &euro;624.  Find me something for less than &euro;1,200 in my area.  If you can do it, you are a better person than me.  We will accelerate the homelessness problem by virtue of this initiative that is rolled out as a solution when it will only cause even more problems.  We saw the disgraceful programme last night on RTE.  There is a price to be paid, not least the price for emergency accommodation and the damage that is being done to children.  If one looks at the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, one will see that it does not go beyond Dublin.  If a person ends up homeless in Kildare, there is no joined-up arrangement and they can end up without a social welfare payment in addition to being without a home.  The person is told to go off and self-accommodate.  I have begged some of the Dublin agencies to take Kildare families and they have generously done so.  This is a disaster and its origin is in the Department of Social Protection and the arrangement around rent assistance.<\/p> <p> At the end of every electoral term and just before the general election, there is a rush to appoint people to positions.  Sometimes they are suitable but sometimes they are not.  I hope we are not going to see that in the next week or two.  In respect of finding a mechanism or way around appointing someone, someone for whom I have great regard and who I think has great abilities, those abilities are undermined by virtue of the fact that the system is bypassed for what is perceived to be an insider.  It does not do politics or the T&aacute;naiste any credit.  I am sorry to say that I have no difficulty voting no confidence in her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900045#SS00600","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453236600,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I rise in support of this Private Members' motion of no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.  We were promised a democratic revolution after the last general election.  Of course, this is certainly not the case as we have seen time and again since then.  In the past week, we have seen that cronyism is alive and well and at the heart of Government and that a &quot;get out&quot; clause is being used not just by the T&aacute;naiste but by other Ministers to appoint party members and cronies to State boards.  We were told that we would have transparency and accountability, a democratic revolution, D&aacute;il reform and appointments to State boards that would be fully transparent.  In the case of Mr. Begg, Ms Mangan and others, we find that there was no advertising, <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>and the Public Appointments Service were not used and there was no short-listing of candidates.  These were personal appointments by the particular Ministers.<\/p><p>Even if the advertising took place and <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>and the Public Appointments Service were used, it would be a smokescreen for cronyism because we know about the formula this Government is using in respect of appointments to State boards - two for Fine Gael and one for the Labour Party.  We have seen this not just in this Government but in previous ones.  We noticed that Fianna F&aacute;il is criticising the T&aacute;naiste in respect of this.  This is like the pot calling the kettle black.  Other speakers have said that coming up to the last election, Fianna F&aacute;il made something like 60 appointments to State boards.<\/p><p>The appointment of Mr. Begg in particular has raised significant problems.  He had the audacity and gall to suggest that &euro;20,000 was not a crock of gold.  I would have thought that as a former trade union chief, he would be well aware of the fact that 125,000 workers earn less than &euro;20,000 per year.  Surely he would be aware that a family of two adults and two children on social welfare exist on less than &euro;20,000 per year.  How dare he suggest that &euro;20,000 is not a crock of gold.  It may not be to him but to thousands upon thousands of part-time workers, low-paid workers and families on social welfare, it is effectively only an existence.<\/p><p>I believe that Mr. Begg is particularly unsuited to this job as chair of the Pensions Authority.  Mr. Begg was a member of the board of the Central Bank from 2003 to 2007.  This board allowed the financial system as a whole to borrow 50% of GDP.  We are not talking about individual banks.  We are talking about the financial system as a whole.  This board, including Mr. Begg, allowed that system to borrow 50% of GDP.  Nobody called a halt, not even Mr. Begg.  That level of borrowing was ruinous.  The recently retired former Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, said that this level of borrowing was hitherto unprecedented.  This level of borrowing led to austerity, the bust and the devastation of families across this country.  I believe that Mr. Begg, who signed off on the financial stability reports of the Central Bank during those years, is particularly unsuited to and not qualified for this particular appointment.<\/p><p> Broken promises and the breaking and reneging on of commitments made in the course of a general election have also been part and parcel of this Government as of previous Governments.  The Labour Party in particular has broken every promise and commitment it made during the course of the last general election.  It was opposed to water charges but the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, is implementing water charges.  Does the T&aacute;naiste remember the \"Tesco\" advertisement?  It said there would be no cuts to child benefit but there were cuts.  The Department of Social Protection has been devastated by this Minister.  I support the motion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900046#TT00200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453237200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>In the dark recesses of the Internet I found a great, aspirational document about how political cronyism can be dealt with.

It is also clear to everybody that the Government and the T&aacute;naiste in particular, the Leader of the Labour Party, chose to bypass those particularly clear processes.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste stands condemned by her own words and by the platform on which she and her party were elected.  This is absolutely inexcusable but that has not stopped the Labour Party trying to find a way to excuse it.  The excuse of choice as far as I can tell from the Labour Party is that articulated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, saying it is not against the rules, which is what the Ministers opposite were trying to express a moment ago.  Is that the best the bringers of the democratic revolution, the promisers of political reform, the slayers of cronyism in Irish political life, can do?  It is the equivalent of the dog ate my homework.  We know it is not against the rules.  Nobody is saying it is against the rules.  There is a problem with the rules but that is not the point.  Is it right or wrong?  Is it cronyism or not?  Would the T&aacute;naiste have appointed, in the manner in which she has appointed David Begg, someone of similar or the exact same qualifications who was not personally known to her and was not a political supporter of the Labour Party?  The answer is obvious.<\/p><p>The second excuse of choice is that articulated by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, on the radio this morning, that nobody has credibly challenged David Begg&rsquo;s qualifications.  I have no idea if David Begg is suitably qualified or not.  I am not sure any of the Ministers opposite have any idea whether he is qualified but I am very strongly of the opinion that David Begg has not been appointed because of those qualifications, appropriate or not, but because he is known to the T&aacute;naiste and because of his support for the Labour Party and what the T&aacute;naiste previously referred to as services to the Labour movement.  For that, one can read services to the Labour Party in keeping a lid on the Labour movement throughout the time the Labour Party has been in government and he has been general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, working to prevent his members protesting and striking against this Government.<\/p><p>We all know the Government has a big majority in this House.

That the Government can have such a poll here only speaks to how wildly out of touch are all the establishment parties.  There is a poll running in the <i>TheJournal.ie<\/i>in which 80% of people say they have no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.  If there are further revelations tomorrow about other appointments, that figure will rise.  In five or six weeks&rsquo; time people will have a chance to vote no confidence in this Government, the Labour Party, and the T&aacute;naiste.  They will have the chance to say &quot;No&quot; to broken promises and political cronyism and to demand a political revolution against the establishment parties, to clear them out and build a different type of politics and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900047#UU00600","speaker":"1197"},{"type":"speech","time":1453237200,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;has full confidence in the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection and commends her role in the Government&rsquo;s achievements including:<blockquote>&mdash; a comprehensive package of reform implemented by this Government including restoring freedom of information, regulation of lobbying, protection of whistleblowers, extending the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, reform of the Public Appointments Service system, open Government initiatives and notes that the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 is currently before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the introduction of the landmark Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work programmes to tackle the unprecedented jobs crisis;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the decrease in the unemployment rate to 8.8%, down from the crisis peak of 15.1%;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the creation of 135,800 extra jobs since the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work programmes have been launched, with every region experiencing jobs growth over that time;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the increase in the minimum wage for the second time, meaning that, by the end of this Government&rsquo;s term, it will have increased by more than &euro;3,000 a year;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the transformation of the Department of Social Protection through the roll-out of the Intreo one-stop-shop employment and support service to support jobseekers getting back to work; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the turnaround in the Social Insurance Fund from a deficit of almost &euro;2 billion to a projected surplus in 2016.&rdquo; <\/blockquote><\/blockquote><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the motion that the House has confidence in me as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  I was appointed Minister in 2011.  By then, Fianna F&aacute;il had cut social welfare benefits in a succession of budgets by &euro;16.30 a week.  It got rid of the Christmas bonus, slashed jobseeker's payments, disability payments, payments to carers and more besides.  In the programme for Government negotiations, my colleagues and I insisted there would be no reductions in core welfare payments on our watch.  We also insisted that public servants would be protected as far as possible and that there would be no increase in income tax rates or reduction in tax credits.<\/p><p>Now, five years later, I am very proud to say that together with our coalition partners we have managed to end the worst recession in Ireland in living memory while remaining true to those core commitments.  Core welfare rates have been retained and because this Government has driven recovery and returned the public finances to health, I was in a position over the past two budgets to make a series of targeted welfare increases.  These included the 75% restoration of the Christmas bonus in December, and an increase in the State pension, although small, this year.<\/p><p>I was also in position to increase child benefit and restore respite care grant in full, increase fuel allowances and the living alone allowance.  During my time as Minister, I have had to deal with an unprecedented level of unemployment, the toxic inheritance of Fianna F&aacute;il's reckless economic management.  I was clear in my own mind from the start that I wanted the Department to go about its job in a different way, to move from being a passive provider of benefits to an active and engaged public employment service that served not just as a safety net when people fell, but as a trampoline to help them return to work, training and education.<\/p><p> To do this, we opened Intreo offices throughout the country where people can get personal assistance in getting back to work, training and education.  We expanded training and work experience schemes and introduced incentive schemes such as JobsPlus to help employers hire people who had been long-term unemployed.  As a result, unemployment has fallen dramatically in all parts of the country and all sectors of the economy.  The job is not yet done but we are well on the way.<\/p> <p> In 2011, we were approaching half a million people unemployed.  Now we are just a few years away from full employment.  In 2011, we were bankrupt; we could not pay to keep the country running and we could not borrow.  Now we have sent the troika home, our borrowing rates are hardly more than 1% and the budget is close to balance.<\/p> <p> In 2011, we were in deep recession.  Now we are the fastest growing economy in Europe.  In 2011, the Social Insurance Fund, which pays for crucial benefits for workers, was in crisis, with its deficit peaking at &euro;2.7 billion.  This year, it will be in surplus to the tune of &euro;217 million.<\/p> <p> The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government cut the minimum wage.  This Government has increased it twice and put in place a mechanism which will allow for further increases in the future.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government imposed USC on all incomes over &euro;4,000.  This Government has taken half a million people out of the USC net and reduced the rates on low and middle incomes.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government savagely cut public servants' pay in 2009 and 2010.  By contrast, the Haddington Road agreement reduced pay only for those earning more than &euro;65,000 and we have already started the process of reversing the Fianna F&aacute;il cuts.  In short, we are in a much better place than five years ago.<\/p> <p> I do not claim all of the credit for this for the Labour Party or for the Government but we have played our part - an important part in what has been a major national achievement.  It is a national achievement that has seen people give immensely to get the country back on its feet.<\/p> <p> Apparently, it is my appointment of David Begg which prompted Deputy Ross to place the original motion of no confidence.  Perhaps I am not the best person to make this observation but I will make it nonetheless.  In all my years in this House, I cannot remember a no confidence motion which was so threadbare, flimsy and insubstantial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900047#UU00700","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453237800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900048#VV00200","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1453237800,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Even Deputy Ross accepts that the guidelines on appointments to State boards were fully complied with.

Even if we accept that, however, I still find it extraordinary that Deputy Ross and his supporters - some of whom apparently like to think they are left-wing - would use the procedures of this House to pursue what seems to be nothing more than a personal vendetta against a man who has given decades of service to Irish workers.<\/p>  <p>  We can recall who Shane Ross championed for senior roles in Irish life.

It is thanks to David Begg and others in the trade union movement and the work of Kieran Mulvey, as mediator in the case, that the workers in Waterford Glass secured their rightful incomes into the future.<\/p>  <p>  This House will be aware that I appointed David Begg in accordance with the guidelines for appointments to State boards, as agreed by the Government.  The regulations provide that a Minister may appoint a chair of a board without asking for the help of PAS in circumstances where an individual is \"evidently and objectively highly qualified\".<\/p>  <p>  In the past few days, I have heard suggestions that this provision is a get-out clause or some kind of aberration.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is a provision agreed by Government to provide for exactly the sort of circumstances which apply here.  The chair of a State board must be a person of integrity.  He or she must be someone with expertise and experience in the issues which the board has to deal with.<\/p>  <p>  David Begg is all of these things.  He is a totally trustworthy man, a person of great ability and experience, with years of public service.  I wanted and expected someone with those qualities as chair of the Pensions Board.  I confess I wanted someone who has years of experience of dealing with pensions from the perspective of workers but who also understands the bigger picture.  I am extremely confident that David Begg will work closely with the Pensions Authority and other members of the board to build on the pension reforms made in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  As we seek to improve levels of pension provision, the role of the authority will be key in the reform and simplification of the pensions landscape, in ensuring schemes operate efficiently and effectively and in providing a regulatory structure which gives pension savers confidence in the system.

Mr. Begg will bring a strong focus on the needs of consumers, pension scheme members, pensioners and trustees.<\/p>  <p>  Ministers are responsible to the House for their actions and David Begg's suitability for this role means I am more than happy to do so in this case.  In addition, the individual concerned must appear before the relevant D&aacute;il committee and I expect that David Begg will do so later this month.<\/p>  <p>  It seems very odd that somebody like Deputy Halligan, who, generally, I have found to be a decent person and who came to me and privately championed a resolution for the Waterford Glass pension crisis which left thousands of workers in the company without their pensions, would not acknowledge that David Begg worked day and night to get a solution for Waterford and the work that was done with other people in the trade union movement in Waterford city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900048#VV00800","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1453237800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I did not criticise David Begg.

I also express confidence in the plan we have implemented to bring the country back from the brink of economic catastrophe.<\/p>  <p>  Fine Gael and Labour put these plans together at a time of very deep crisis as we entered office: our banks were on the brink of collapse, our public finances were in chaos, our international reputation was destroyed and our people were both out of hope and out of work.  The previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government's reckless mismanagement of the country's economy saw Ireland excluded from being able to borrow on the international markets and the humiliating troika bailout of our country that made headlines around the world.<\/p>  <p>  On this day five years ago the country was gripped by an economic crisis.  The public finances were out of control and jobs were being lost at an alarming rate.  On entering office, we set out a plan and, working with the people, we have worked our way back towards recovery.  Today we see the early results because today Ireland is the fastest-growing economy in Europe.  Government borrowing has fallen from 11% of GDP in 2010 to less than 2% last year.  Since the low point of 2012, some 135,000 new jobs have been added to the economy.  Unemployment is down from a peak of over 15% to 8.8% and will continue to fall in the time ahead.<\/p>  <p>  However, there would be little point in creating new jobs if those on the dole queues could not fill them.  The reform of our welfare system under the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, remains an essential part of our long-term economic plan to reach full employment and keep this recovery going.  The T&aacute;naiste has driven this reform agenda over the past five years as Minister for Social Protection.  The reforms she has introduced were absolutely necessary considering the unprecedented unemployment challenge we inherited from the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.<\/p>  <p>  What was worse than the 15% unemployment was that many people and entire families were abandoned on the dole queues by a passive welfare system.  Fianna F&aacute;il's disastrous hands-off approach to social welfare policy that avoided taking any decisions or implementing any difficult reforms led directly to families - parents and their children - being trapped in cycles of joblessness, poverty and welfare dependency.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of investing in job-support services and helping to get people who were long-term unemployed back into the world of work, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party just hiked welfare payments without reform which ensured that even during the so-called boom years Ireland suffered from one of the highest rates of jobless households in Europe.  Our commitment to everyone is that we will not go back to that style of government.  I want to see people independent in work and not dependent on welfare.  We believe that a job is the best route out of poverty, that work should pay and that people should not be abandoned on the dole queues.  This Fine Gael-Labour Government will break that endless cycle of poverty by getting people off those welfare queues and into jobs.<\/p>  <p>  The first Pathways to Work strategy has been successful in reducing by almost 40% the numbers of people unemployed since 2012.  The establishment of the Intreo offices throughout the country and new activation programmes and supports such as JobBridge, JobsPlus, Springboard courses, MOMENTUM courses, the new housing assistance payment and the Youth Guarantee are all engaging with unemployed people every day to bring them back into work.<\/p>  <p>  I saw this in opening a number of Intreo offices with the T&aacute;naiste.  We spoke to the group leaders who meet groups of people who are unemployed.  They deal individually with people who might have a particular motivation, incentive or aspiration to follow an upskilling or training course, learn a language, computer skills or whatever to get into the world of work.  These developments have also contributed to decreases in long-term unemployment from 9.5% to 5% and in youth unemployment from 33% to 19.2%.  While we have made progress, we recognise that this rate is still too high.  We are determined that nobody will be left behind by the economic recovery now under way in the country.<\/p>  <p>  Changing the perception of and culture in the new Intreo welfare offices has changed the way that employers look at lists of people who sign on because they see them as people with the potential to fill very responsible positions in their own areas of employment.  We have first-hand evidence of multinationals committing to take X number of people from the live register of unemployed people because their CVs are such that they can be upskilled or retrained and given opportunities to fill very responsible positions.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is not yet finished the job.  We are determined to keep this recovery going through a simple long-term plan based on three fundamental steps: more jobs spread right across the country, making work pay and as a consequence sensible investment in public services.  The employment of teachers, nurses, garda&iacute;, resource teachers and special needs assistants is vital in making people's lives that much better.  More people in work creates the resources to cut taxes for working people and to invest in better services, creating a virtuous circle of rising employment and improving living standards and people's lifestyles.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday in Naas we launched the national plan for jobs.  Our aim is to create a further 200,000 jobs by 2020.  As part of that we will bring back 70,000 people who have left Ireland for whatever reason and are now working abroad.  By making work pay through tax and welfare reform we can boost the economy, create more jobs and secure the recovery for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  We have begun to tackle the marginal tax rates on middle-income earners and have reduced the marginal rate of tax to below 50% for all earners under &euro;70,000.  It is our intention to continue to phase out the USC in future budgets, while also reforming the income tax system to cap the benefits for the highest earners and to keep the income tax system broad.  While making these necessary changes to the tax system we want to protect the progress made in restoring the public finances thereby allowing us to invest sensibly in public services in terms of garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and so on.<\/p>  <p>  In the future the Government has set out to cap public spending increases to below the underlying growth rate of the economy to ensure we never slip back to the days of boom and bust.  As a Government we aim to eliminate the budget deficit entirely in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Government that I am proud to lead and work with the T&aacute;naiste as leader of the Labour Party has a clear plan to keep this economy going to build on the progress we have made as a nation.<\/p><p>Since her appointment as T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, and I have worked very closely in the delivery and management of the Government's work.  The T&aacute;naiste and I have a shared determination to continue to work to secure the economic recovery of this country and to see that the benefits of a strong economy are used to improve the daily lives of all the people.  We are both fully committed to asking the people, in due course, to re-elect this Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, so we can finish the job we started in 2011, having been given the mandate by the people to fix our public finances and put our country back to work.<\/p> <p> When I listened to the contributions from Deputies opposite, I saw no vision nor did I hear any plan.  I listened to opportunism and gamesmanship on a whole raft of issues.  We will not take any lectures from my good friend over there, Deputy Ross.  He has judged character before when making comments from that very seat.  I recall when he was the cheerleader for some of the people in Anglo Irish Bank who used the facility of the Fourth Estate - Deputy Ross's other professional capacity - to put pressure on other banks to appoint dynamic bankers with stellar careers from Anglo Irish Bank into senior positions.  That record is there for all to see in black and white, which I am sure Deputy Ross understands.<\/p> <p> This Government stands by its record of jobs, stability, growth and recovery.  Accordingly, I am very happy to support the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, as Deputy Leader of the Government, and to commend her continued success to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900049#WW00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453239000,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I am pleased to speak on this motion of no confidence in the T&aacute;naiste.  The timing is remarkably fitting.  We have come to the end of five shameful years of a Labour Party in government which has left many people worse off than they were even in the difficult times when it took over.<\/p><p>On the State board's appointment issue, which brought about this motion, I have a press release from 25 November 2014, entitled, Howlin Publishes State Board Guidelines.  It stated:<\/p><blockquote>Speaking after Cabinet, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, commented:<br \/><br \/>These guidelines set out clearly how the new appointments process for State Boards will work in practice.  They will assist all Departments to engage effectively with the Public Appointments Service to draw up clear specifications of board roles.  These can then be openly advertised so that the expressions of interest can be sought from the widest possible pool.  The Public Appointments Service will then assemble a shortlist of suitable candidates for the Minister to select from.<\/blockquote><p>The Minister added:<\/p><blockquote>This new process will improve corporate governance on our State Boards, widen the pool from which members of State Boards are drawn, and ensure that the process around appointments to State Boards is [wait for it] transparent.  I would urge anyone interested in serving on a State Board to visit <i>stateboards.ie<\/i>and express an interest.  [Unless one is on the inside track with the Labour Party or other Ministers.]<\/blockquote><p>The note for editors accompanying this press release stated:<\/p><blockquote>The guidelines published will secure a high degree of transparency in the selection of candidates for appointment by the relevant Minister. ... Under the new arrangements assessment of the suitability of a candidate for a board position will be performed by Public Appointments Service.<\/blockquote><p>That was 100% good spin.  Many people probably bought it and thought it sounded good.  Many people would have said the Government was genuine in its efforts to reform appointments to State boards.<\/p><p>On 26 November 2014, I issued a press release entitled, Howlin Blows Chance to Reform State Appointment Process.  Despite the PR and the spin, it was clear to me Ministers had a back door available to them to allow them sidestep the legislation in its entirety.  In that press release, I stated:<\/p><blockquote>Minister Brendan Howlin announced a new model for dealing with these matters.  He introduced guidelines which he would request Ministers to implement.  [He was only going to request Ministers and even if they accepted the guidelines, they were still only guidelines and not statutory.]  I believe these voluntary guidelines will not be satisfactory and the public require a clear statutory process that they can be satisfied will be implemented in full.<\/blockquote><p>That is why on 26 November 2014, I introduced the State Boards (Appointments) Bill 2014 in the D&aacute;il.  I stated at the time:<\/p><blockquote>The essential difference between this legislation and the Government&rsquo;s proposals is that Fianna F&aacute;il believes that this matter needs to be dealt with on a statutory basis and not by way of guidelines, merely drawn up to assist Ministers.  If the Government is serious about political reform and commitment to real openness and transparency it will accept this legislation.<\/blockquote><p>From day one, the Government was pulling a fast one.  It fooled many of the people on that occasion but not all the people.  At this stage, I do not believe the Government has fooled anyone because the public has actually seen through it.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, or Minister Howlin, as he refers to himself in his own press releases, did a snow job on the public and the media, trying to convince them with what he was doing with appointments to State boards.  However, the substance was always known to the members of the Cabinet.  These were only guidelines which they could ignore if they liked and they could carry on in their merry way, as we have seen them doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900050#XX00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239000,"counter":496,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900050#XX00300","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>It was a sham from the very beginning.<\/p>  <p>  I listened with incredulity when the T&aacute;naiste spoke earlier.  She demonstrated why she is at the end of the road after five years.  When one is five years in government, one becomes detached and removed.  One starts to believe one&rsquo;s own publicity.  The T&aacute;naiste probably believes those press releases by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to some extent, as well as her own ones.<\/p>  <p>  This evening, the T&aacute;naiste said that five years later, she was very proud that she and her coalition partners managed to end the worst recession in Ireland in living memory.  Talk about conceit and arrogance.  Nobody is worried whether she feels proud or not.  The T&aacute;naiste did not end it.  In fact, she made the recovery worse, making it a two-tier one, dividing society in the process.  She claimed she and Fine Gael solved the economic crisis when it was the people who did and suffered in the process.  She said the people should be grateful to her for solving the economic crisis.  I advise her to continue to say that every day for the next six weeks because she will get her answer then.  If she goes around telling the people how wonderful she is and how proud she is for solving the economic crisis, she will get her answer.  If she keeps up that level of arrogance, the people of Ireland will show her their way of dealing with such arrogance.<\/p>  <p>  She also told another big lie this evening.  She knows that when she came into government, there was a troika agreement in place.  It was a three-year agreement with a date by which the troika was to leave Ireland.  This was set out in an international binding agreement before the T&aacute;naiste ever came into office.  However, she told us that the Government sent the troika home.  The Government had no say in it whatsoever as there was an international binding agreement with a date for the troika&rsquo;s exit written in stone with which the Government complied in full.  The troika left on the appointed day, as set out on the first day it arrived.  For her to be so arrogant and actually to believe she sent the troika home speaks for the level of self-delusion in this Government.<\/p><p> With respect to matters at national level over which the Government has control, this is where it will come a cropper with the public.  Many things on the international sphere have gone well for Ireland and Irish people are happy to see an improvement in the international and national finances but people are not feeling it in their households.  I would look to areas, including housing, and now we have the housing crisis, over which Labour Party Ministers have had control.  The Labour Party Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, is responsible for housing.  The Minister, Deputy John Burton - or I suppose she believes she should be called \"T&aacute;naiste\" all the time - is responsible for social welfare and social protection payments.  Those two Labour Party Ministers between them have created a homelessness situation that has never existed in Ireland to the extent we have seen it in recent times.<\/p> <p> We were accused of building too many houses when we were in government, and it is took some turnabout for this Government to turn a surplus of houses into a homelessness crisis in a short period of five years.  There are two reasons this has happened.  One is that the Government allowed NAMA to sell off many houses at knockdown prices to vulture funds from American, Canada and China.  Furthermore, the local councils were not given the money to take up the houses that NAMA was offering them.  Between the way the Government has run NAMA and the way it funded the local authorities, we now have a ridiculous situation where the Minister with responsibility for housing, rather than spending &euro;30,000 repairing and refurbishing a vacant council house to provide a permanent home for people to live in, would prefer to spend &euro;190,000 on a temporary prefab house.  They are nicer looking than the old prefabs that we had years ago but that is what they are.  They are fabricated off site; they are simply put together.  The Government would rather spend &euro;190,000 on a prefab temporary structure than &euro;30,000 to refurbish a vacant house and there are 3,000 such vacant houses throughout the country.  The Government prefers to do the photocall for these wonderful houses.  I will not talk about who got the contracts for that housing but most people will know that one does not have to look too far from the friends of Fine Gael in Government on this issue.<\/p> <p> Why have we a housing crisis and why are people on the housing waiting list finding it difficult to get a house?  The reason is that Minister, Deputy Burton, has refused to deal adequately with the rental supplement during the past few years.  When rents were increasing, she refused to do it.  She has bought into the Fine Gael mantra that one cannot interfere with the market.  That is what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, says about the banks, that one cannot interfere with them.  That is why an Irish owned bank, AIB, is paying three times the interest on deposit rates to depositors in Germany than it will pay to Irish people who are living in Ireland.  Perhaps it is the Taoiseach's way of saying \"Thank you\" to Angela Merkel.  He is probably heading off to Davos tomorrow or the next day for a little tap on the head from some of these wonderful big bankers in Germany.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900050#XX00400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>Is the Deputy going?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Not at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>The Deputy seems to know a lot more about it than I do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach will get a tap on the head from Angela Merkel and a few of the big financial institutions in Germany-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>It sounds like the Deputy wants to be out on the piste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00600","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>-----as they say &quot;Thank you&quot; for the extra interest rate he is giving them and as they say the poor people in Ireland can afford to pay them back because did they not stand by us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00700","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very fond of the piste.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00800","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>They did in their hats stand by us.<\/p>  <p>  This leads to the issue of being under control.  There are 130,000 people on the housing list.  I listened to Members talk about the television programme they saw last night.  I had three different groups in my office this morning in connection with housing before I left for Dublin.  One person was a woman whose husband is paralysed and in a wheelchair and they have five children.  All she wants is for a shower to be installed in her house, but the Government is cutting back on its expenditure in that area.  There was another couple who have children and they were promised a house, but it was taken from them because they were told they did not have the funds to purchase the house that they had hoped to buy.  The third case involved a young fellow who was in the care of the State but on reaching the age of 18 there was not a proper plan in place for him.  He is 21 years of age now and he has been living in a stable in County Laois for the last three months.  Unscrupulous landlords are renting stables.  Three stables are being rented and none of them has a toilet or a water supply; there is a shared facility for the three of them.  However, the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, sees it fit to pay rent supplement on that substandard accommodation.  If the Minister examined what she was doing in terms of the rental supplement, she would pay for proper accommodation that is available and not force people to live in a stable.<\/p>  <p>  Those three groups were in my office at 9 o'clock this morning.  We as Deputies are picking up the legacy of the homelessness situation created by the Labour Party  Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is not getting his act together to deal with the housing issue, and the Minister for Social Protection who is responsible for the rental supplement.  What did the Minister for Public Expenditure and Control, Deputy Howlin, say today?  He said that is a matter for the next Government, that it will be a priority for the next Government, but it is a priority for the people here and now.  We have the homelessness situation and the lack of house building over which the Government has stood idly by during the past five years when it could have used good funds instead of paying higher interest rates to German people to put money into AIB.  It would have been better off investing money in housing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I would also point to the addressing the jobs issue, which the Government promised, but every time those in Government talk about it they ignore the fact that one of the reasons the number of those in receipt of jobseeker's allowance has reduced is because the Government has ensured that most of them had to take a one way ticket to Sydney, Perth or to other countries.  It has a policy of forcing young people to leave the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY00900","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The Deputy should stop talking nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY01000","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1453239600,"counter":508,"content":"<p>With respect to the Minister's record in the next six weeks, I look forward to her meeting the people and talking about the two-tier recovery.  There is a two-tier recovery and the Labour Party should be, and is, ashamed of the fact that it stood by Fine Gael giving tax cuts to the wealthy while it made people on low incomes suffer.  The Government has had five regressive budgets, documented by the ESRI,  Fr. Sean Healy and everyone else, and the poor people have suffered most under the Labour Party's reign.  I will not even go into its broken promises, about which another former Minister from the Labour Party said that is what one does in a election.  Deputy Rurar&iacute; Quinn said there would no increase in third level fees.  The Labour Party broke every promise.  It has no credibility and its Ministers should be ashamed of themselves.

The T&aacute;naiste, as everyone else, understands the nature of politics.  Motions of confidence are put down and the Government will praise her.  The Government will vote in favour of the motion and the Opposition will outline all of the T&aacute;naiste's flaws and failings and we will vote against the motion.  That is sometimes part of the theatre that goes on in here.  However, underneath the theatre there are genuine reasons Opposition Members have no confidence not only in the T&aacute;naiste but also in this Government.  We see these reasons, as I am sure Government party members see them every day in their work in their constituencies.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste can argue all she likes that a recovery is under way but the reality is that the recovery is a two-tier one.  I am sure if she goes into her constituency - I say the same to the Minister of State in the Department, Deputy Kevin Humphreys - they will see the two-tier recovery.  They will see those who are benefitting and those who are worse off than they were five years ago.<\/p>  <p>  I find it hard to stomach some of the Fianna F&aacute;il rhetoric, even from the previous speaker, Deputy Sean Fleming, about public appointments, when in the dying days of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in December 2010, 90 appointments were made to State boards, including the Pensions Authority.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a Bill to implement statutory recommendations rather than the guidelines that were introduced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, yet the party did nothing when it was in government.  I take everything Fianna F&aacute;il says on these issues with a pinch of salt.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the T&aacute;naiste, as the deputy Head of Government, and as the leader of the Labour Party, must bear responsibility for what is happening in society.  There is huge suffering.  We have touched on homelessness.<\/p><p>We have touched on issues that affect terminally ill children and those with medical cards, as well as involve cuts for carers, in child benefit and the death grant.  These are all choices the Government has made and which the T&aacute;naiste has stood over.  Many of the cuts were made by her Department, including those to the back-to-school clothing allowance.<\/p> <p> Before I came into the Chamber I spoke to an individual who said I could read his e-mail, but I will not name him.  His case is an example of what I have outlined.  He is living in Cork and was in private rented accommodation.  He has a partner and two children, both of whom are under the age of four years.  Unfortunately, they have been living in a hotel for the past four months.  Following the announcement of the impending legislation their then landlord put up their rent.  Following advice, they sought help from the Department, the local welfare officer and Threshold, but, unfortunately, they could not continue to rent the property.  They have been on the local authority housing list for five years and ended up becoming homeless.  They were in such desperation, living in a hotel room, that on 28 December the young man in question tried to take his own life.  Thankfully, he was found in time by his father-in-law who had to kick in the bathroom door.  Because he was unconscious paramedics were called who said he was probably two to three minutes away from death.  Thankfully, he has come out of that situation with a real determination to get his life back on track.  However, he is not getting any help.  He has been to the local authorities and the local welfare officer, but under the existing guidelines and the limits in place, he cannot find a property to rent in Cork city .  That is the reality.<\/p> <p> Until the Government recognises that housing is a huge issue, those who must continue to live in hotels will, unfortunately in some cases, see no way out and no light at the end of the tunnel.  People are losing their lives which, sadly, is a legacy of the Government.  Members of the Government parties can talk about the improvements made, but they must also recognise that the Government got things wrong.  I do not take issue with anyone who puts up his or her hands and says, &ldquo;I got it wrong.&rdquo;  I will finish on this point.  In fairness to the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, when he tried to cut funding for DEIS, he put up his hands and said, &ldquo;I got it wrong.  I am going to reverse it.&rdquo;  There have been too many arrogant Labour Party Ministers, including, in particular, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  There is no love lost between us.  Unfortunately, he will not put up his hands and say, for example, to the individual about whom I have just spoken, &ldquo;I got this wrong.  We are going to reverse it and to try to find some credible solutions.\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011900051#YY01300","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453240200,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1453240200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 9.15 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 January 2016.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
