The hospital has been synonymous with serious overcrowding.  This project, worth more than &euro;20 million, was a welcome addition to the health infrastructure in the area and was welcomed by the hard-working staff at the hospital and by the patients.<\/p> <p>The project involves a four storey extension, 9,000 m2 which included the addition of additional theatre space, and of 83 inpatient beds.  Nowhere in the country is this facility more needed.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is the de facto regional hospital and serves a rapidly growing area, Louth, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Fingal.  The emergency department, ED, needs all the facilities, equipment and staff that a modern department needs to allow it function to the maximum.  One such critical facility is an X-ray room.  I was alarmed to learn this week that the plans to include a new X-ray facility at the expanded ED have been ditched in what appears to be a cost-cutting exercise.  To add insult to injury, this appears to have been a unilateral decision that was taken without any consultation whatsoever with front-line staff at the hospital.<\/p> <p>The new section opened this week but the bird is in effect flying on one wing.  The space is there and the full expectation was that the new X-ray room would be provided but it was pulled at the eleventh hour.  Now we have a spanking new emergency department extension in Drogheda but no additional X-ray room.  The existing X-ray room processes 53,000 images annually.  Patient figures for throughput at the new emergency department extension would suggest that there would be an annual increase of 5% in patients going through that facility year on year for the foreseeable future.  The existing room is operating above capacity.  EDs of a similar scale in Limerick and Cork deal with 49,000 and 42,000 images, respectively, annually.  The figures speak for themselves.<\/p> <p>The Lourdes needs a second X-ray room in ED.  It is not too late in the building project to revisit this and for the sake of the &euro;1 million that I understand it would cost, the new room needs to be built now.  If it is not, the good work done by staff and management at the hospital in recent years to address the overcrowding problems will be compromised.  Patients will suffer as, to paraphrase the Taoiseach, a hospital cannot function at full whack if it does not have the full diagnostic capacity to move people through the system efficiently and get them well as quickly as possible.  The space is there and it will be impossible to retrofit a new X-ray room into the ED building.  This has to be reviewed.  It is a short-sighted decision to pull this project now, a decision made by the bean counters in the HSE and it must be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#A00400","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for the opportunity to provide an update to the House on the planned new X-ray facility to support the expanded ED at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  As the Senator is aware, the new emergency department is a part of the major capital infrastructure project that is taking place at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which includes additional beds, theatres as well as the expanded ED.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform governs the processes surrounding the development of healthcare projects by way of guidelines, principally the public spending code.  Further rigour is demanded by, and set out in, relevant EU directives.  All proposed projects must be submitted to the HSE's capital and property steering committee for approval and prioritisation prior to inclusion in its multi-annual capital plans.<\/p> <p>The national development plan, announced earlier this year as part of the Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments throughout the country, including national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.  Health capital projects and programmes currently under way will continue.  With regard to progress on this project, the Minister has been advised by the HSE that the new emergency department, which will be located on the ground floor of the hospital, will be completed and available to open in early 2019.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The HSE has further advised that some work is still to be completed in the old emergency department to allow for the installation of a new paediatric emergency department and an extension to radiology services.

The additional X-ray room is critically important if the full diagnostic capacity of the hospital is to work.  We have additional new beds.  As I said in my opening remarks, if a new X-ray facility is not provided, the hard work that is done by staff day in, day out to address the trolley crisis and the overcrowding in the emergency department will come to naught.  It will be difficult to move people through the hospital efficiently and efficaciously in the absence of a new X-ray room.<\/p> <p>I am somewhat reassured by what the Minister of State said, having been alarmed to hear earlier this week that the estates section of the HSE appeared to have decided to pull this project.  I will hold the Government and the HSE to account to make sure the commitment the Minister of State appeared to make when he said \"that the full extension [to radiology services] will be ready in early 2019\" will be delivered on.  When he refers to a full extension, I hope he means the inclusion of the X-ray department.  My understanding is that the new emergency department block at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital became operational earlier this week.  However, we are still waiting for a new X-ray room.  I have referred to the number of images managed at the small X-ray room in the existing emergency department.  That needs to be enhanced to allow the hospital to meet its commitments and targets.  As already stated, the level of throughput at the emergency department is expected to increase by 5% per annum in the coming years.  The emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital cannot fly on one wing.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  I think we will all agree it is absolutely appalling and shocking that LGBT people are being targeted and arrested in contravention of many international human rights agreements to which Tanzania has signed up.  It is important to put this in context.  A special task force has been convened to round up members of the LGBT community.  LGBT people in Tanzania are facing increasing threats.  Members of the LGBT community have been arrested, targeted, harassed and charged with unrelated offences.  Since 2015, under the regime of President Magufuli, there has been a deterioration in human rights and the rule of law in Tanzania.  I put it to the Minister of State that it is a disgrace that this is being allowed to happen.  It is a contravention of justice.  I am calling on our Government to intervene at every level to protest the establishment of a task force under the remit of the governor of Dar es Salaam.  The Tanzanian Government has said that it is his opinion, but having an opinion does not give a person the right to have a 17-member or ten-member task force.  It is wrong to call for the outing and arrest of LGBT people.<\/p> <p>I know that Mr. Paul Sherlock is a very proactive ambassador in the region.  I am aware that Tanzania is one of the fastest growing countries in Africa.  I welcome the EU's decision to recall its ambassador to Tanzania.  I am pleased that the EU is considering a review of its relationship with Tanzania.  I do not necessarily think that recalling ambassadors is always the right thing to do, but on this occasion there would be merit in our Government intervening to make its case and state its position.  I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has written to the Tanzanian Government, but our approach must be about more than writing a letter.  We must bring people with us.<\/p> <p>I am glad the Minister of State is here.  I know he is very proactive.  It is worrying that the governor is looking for reports of gay people.  This is not just about gay people, it is also about people who work in HIV clinics and non-governmental organisations to promote human rights.  The overarching strategy that is emanating from Tanzania seems to involve violating privacy rights in a way that infringes on basic human rights.  We have international agreements which must be upheld.  I thank the Minister of State for being here.

Ireland's support for the LGBTI community is clearly situated within a human rights framework.  No one should be stigmatised or persecuted on the grounds of sexual orientation.  Ireland engages with other countries at the UN Human Rights Committee to promote human rights for all.  We specifically promote further support for the principle that sexual orientation should not be grounds for discrimination.<\/p> <p>I learned with dismay last week that the regional commissioner of Dar es Salaam had called on the public to identify members of the LGBTI community to his office, thereby feeding prejudice against members of that community.  It appears that there have been some submissions to his office.  It has been reported that activists and members of the LGBTI community have gone into hiding across Tanzania.  As the Senator will be aware, the Tanzanian statute books continue to have laws from the colonial era which can lead to homosexual acts being punished with terms of imprisonment of up to 30 years.  When the T&aacute;naiste learned of these developments, he immediately wrote to his counterpart, the Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Mahiga, to express his deep concern at the regional commissioner's statements.  The T&aacute;naiste asked Mr. Mahiga and the Tanzanian Government to disown the statements and to bring such provocative action to an end.  Last Sunday, which was two days later, Mr. Mahiga spoke on behalf of the Tanzanian Government to distance himself from the regional commissioner's views.  He characterised the regional commissioner's views as personal and not reflective of the position of the Tanzanian Government.  He reaffirmed the Tanzanian Government's commitment to upholding its international human rights commitments.  In light of Mr. Mahiga&rsquo;s statement, it seems likely that current tensions will abate.<\/p> <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs, through Irish Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which works with other EU member state embassies in the city, will continue to actively monitor the situation in Dar es Salaam and more widely across Tanzania.

Some Members may be aware that in recent weeks the remains of two people who had been missing for a significant period were identified.  The process of reuniting them with their loved ones and giving them a dignified burial will happen, if it has not happened.  It is a wonderful end to a tragedy that these families will be able to give their loved ones, who were missing for decades, a Christian and respectful burial.  It closes a chapter that had dominated their lives for decades.  This has happened as a result of the development of DNA profiling and technologies in that area.  Such development is ongoing.  As a result of recent DNA developments, it has been possible to identify the two remains and return them to their families.<\/p> <p>As part of that process, it has come to my attention through the media and from watching people like Barry Cummins, who have done phenomenal work in raising these issues and keeping them in the media spotlight, that an audit has not been done of unidentified remains in this country.  There are unmarked graves and unidentified remains in morgues and in other areas of this country.  I call for an audit of all the unidentified remains and, also, the provision of a budget to further enable DNA profiling to see if more of these missing persons cases can be resolved.<\/p> <p>Like other Members, I attended the National Missing Persons Day commemorative ceremony in Farmleigh House a few years ago.  In all I have done in public life it was probably one of the most moving ceremonies I have ever been at.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was chair of the Oireachtas committee on justice at the time. and he and I travelled to it.  It was an incredibly moving occasion.  Deputy Frances Fitzgerald was the Minister for Justice and Equality at the time and N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was the Garda Commissioner, and they both attended.  Families shared their stories of what they were going through on a daily basis in dealing with the fact that there was no closure for them.  The format of what happens at one of these missing persons days is that if it is the 10th, 20th, 30th or, in some cases, the 40th anniversary of a missing person, the stories and experiences of those families are shared.  It is an opportunity for all those families to come together and share their experiences and stories.  People even travel from England and the United States for that day.  <\/p> <p>I request the Minister of State, in the first instance, to ensure an audit is carried out of all the unidentified remains that exist in this State and, second, to increase the funding to carry out the critical DNA profiling given that the technologies and the methodologies have advanced so much.

I assure the Senator that the concerned State authorities make every effort to identify such persons by whatever means possible.<\/p> <p>Unidentified remains are the subject of both a Garda investigation, assisted by the relevant State technical authorities and by the relevant coroner for the district where the remains are discovered.

The Minister is unclear as to the purpose of such an audit.  The primary investigating authorities will hold either the remains, or more often, relevant samples for scientific testing.

The database can replace more traditional and time-consuming police investigative methods and provide more focus to a criminal investigation.

He said that the standard of doctors being recruited to hospitals in Ireland is particularly low and the case before him, whereby a doctor was struck off the register, was not an isolated incident.  Clearly, this is a very serious patient safety issue.  The judge said that he was going to refer the matter to the Minister for Health and the HSE.  We cannot have a situation where doctors recruited have inadequate skills and experience and are let loose on the public.  It is simply criminal.  I hope that the Minister will come to the House to discuss the recruitment and retention of doctors.  <\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the matter of the contents of a recent \"RTE Investigates\" programme entitled, Troublemakers, which highlighted the case of the Fitzgerald family.  Mr. Patrick Fitzgerald was not allowed to visit his wife when he wished.  His visits were restricted to certain times.  All of us have had family members in hospital, nursing homes or hospices at some point.  The severe restriction on visiting hours, as highlighted in the programme, is harsh and cruel.  I cannot imagine how I would feel if I were in the same position as Mr. Fitzgerald, unable to visit a loved one in a nursing home or hospice.  I understand that the HSE has yet to contact all the families featured in the documentary.  Again, I ask that the Minister of Health would come to the House to discuss these issues.<\/p> <p>The last issue I wish to raise is a particular problem in urban areas and is a pet hate of mine, namely, people parking on footpaths.  This often means that people using wheelchairs or other walking aids or those pushing buggies cannot get around the cars and are forced to go out onto the road.  It is a growing problem in cities and stems from a lack of awareness.  People need to be cognisant of the fact that if they park on a footpath, they must leave sufficient space for wheelchairs, buggies or other walking devices.  It is very unfair and dangerous not to do so and drivers need to be more thoughtful when parking their cars.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#G01700","speaker":"1407"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I will start by proposing an amendment to the Order of Business, that the House will adjourn at 5 p.m. today, as per the original plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#G01800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#G01900","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Is the Senator proposing that No. 3 concludes at 5 p.m.?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#G02000","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Yes.

I wish to refer again to the Defence Forces.  I read this morning that the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, has 30 cases lined up for the courts with respect to the working time directive and there will be many more such cases.  There are also High Court cases pending related to the use of Lariam, a drug which is given to other ranks troops who are travelling overseas.  Is it the case that the Department of Defence has such deep pockets that it can afford to run every single case through the courts, knowing it is going to lose?  The Department has lost every working time directive case it has fought thus far.  It has been told to implement the working time directive.  However, we all know that in order to do so, it will have to increase the strength of the Defence Forces to around 13,000 but it cannot even recruit enough personnel to fill the current establishment of 9,500.  The Defence Forces strength is below 9,000 at the moment, at approximately 8,800.<\/p> <p>I am a bit like a long playing record in here with respect to the Defence Forces but the people to whom I refer are in the Leader's constituency.  We are hearing stories about soldiers being sent to Haulbowline to do non-naval and shore duties.  If this sort of thing is happening, is it any wonder that people are walking out by the new time?  We have been told that as many as 2,000 troops have been recruited in recent years but new recruits cannot fill the posts of experienced personnel.  The working time directive is about respecting peoples' lives and prior arrangements and about not dropping things on them at the last moment, like the Government is trying to do in this House today.  A little bit of respect goes a long way.  <\/p> <p>My main point is that public money is being spent by the Department fighting cases even though it knows that it cannot win them.

It is deflecting from the real crisis, including the absence to date of a winter plan and inadequate bed capacity.

As a daughter who spent every day in the nursing home with my father for two years before he passed away, I found the programme extremely horrifying to watch.

There have been 4,500 settlements in the first six months of this year.  It is an enormous cost to the State and to people who have cars insured because it mainly has to do with car crashes as opposed to fire, theft or other insurance issues.<\/p> <p>I praise the President of the Circuit Court, Mr. Justice Raymond Donal Groarke, who has been president since June 2012 and served in the Circuit Court from 1995 or thereabouts.  I am sure Senator McDowell would agree that he is an outstanding judge because in recent times he has adjudicated on cases of complete and utter fraud in the courts and we all owe him a great debt of gratitude.  He is doing more than the Government is to solve this problem.  The judicial appointments issue is important so that we get the right type of judge and I am pleased to say that Mr. Justice Groarke is a wonderful judge and it is good to commend somebody of his calibre, courage, conviction and commitment to the job in this House.<\/p> <p>Also, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have a dedicated fraud squad.  When people go into court with cases which are totally falsified they should suffer repercussions and the cases should be followed up.  I know of one case in Roscommon town where a young man drove into a person from Poland and very little damage was done but within six months the person who was driving the other car and got a scratch on the side of the car decided to put in another claim for whiplash.  That young man is now paying a premium of &euro;5,000 a year for what I regard as a falsified claim because I followed up on it and I found the same Polish gentleman out fishing in Lough Ree catching a major pike.<\/p> <p>Insurance companies are too quick to settle these cases.  They should have investigators out there looking at each case, although some insurance companies are better than others.

It is important to realise that between 22 December 2018 and 2 January 2019, there are 12 days.  Seven of those are weekends or public holidays.  The issue that arises relates to moving people out of hospital and into step-down facilities.  What the Taoiseach was referring to is the fact that many people who are in hospital can be moved to step-down facilities.  Last night, I spoke to people involved with Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, who told me that, in the three-week period from Christmas day, they have very little contact with the HSE or hospitals regarding the taking patients into step-down facilities.  I draw attention to work done by NHI as far back as June, July and August in the context of engaging with the unit dealing with the hospitals winter programme.  The NHI received a letter on 31 August from the HSE's special delivery unit outlining that, at the emergency department task force meeting on Thursday, 30 August, the agenda for the forum was amended and the NHI presentation was removed from the programme.  It is not acceptable that NHI attendance on the day was relegated to a network opportunity and not true collaboration.  The NHI represents a sector that is prepared to help deal with hospital overcrowding but it was excluded by the HSE's special delivery unit.  I also have before me a letter, dated 31 October 2018, from Ms Anne O'Connor, co-chair of the emergency department task force, and Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, head of the INMO, which advises the NHI that its correspondence will be brought to the attention of the emergency department task force for discussion at its next meeting in November.  We are talking about correspondence from June, July and August being discussed in November, when we are already into the winter period.  The same person from the INMO was on the radio giving out about what the Taoiseach said.  The co-chair of the task force is not prepared to engage with the NHI, which is prepared to help deal with hospital overcrowding.  This needs to be put on the record and we need to know why the task force is not engaging with NHI and is not prepared to plan for the three-week period in early January in order to take patients out of the hospital sector and make accommodation available to them in step-down facilities where required.  We need answers on this issue from the task force.  We need to know why it is not engaging with the people who are prepared to provide a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#K01900","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I second Senator Craughwell's proposed amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the House discuss the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill until 5 p.m. and then adjourn.

In that context, I am anxious to ensure that I am here for the full debate but I have made arrangements and it would be very difficult for me to be here until late tonight.  On that basis, I am opposing the Order of Business as proposed by Senator Buttimer and seconding Senator Craughwell's amendment which proposes that we debate the Bill until 5 p.m. and then adjourn.

Amazingly, we have a major hospital in Cork University Hospital, CUH, but since 2003 we have no helipad.  If anyone knows the geographical nature of my county, it is more than 120 miles long and we had no helipad in CUH.  The significant development is that CUH has applied for planning permission 15 years after demolishing the previous helipad and now it is going ahead.  It is amazing to think that we had to wait 15 years for a helipad in such a major hospital with such a vast sea that has such activity that we have all unfortunately seen and that needs the co-operation of the Coast Guard services.

Much of the discussion centred around quality of life, not having to spend time commuting and being able to work from home or from a hatch lab as they have in Wexford.  That is a service office near to one's home where he or she can work for their employer or a company.<\/p> <p>All of this is contingent on having decent broadband in the areas people live.  Many of us are lucky enough to live in areas that have good broadband but, equally, many Senators have spoken in this Chamber and I have spoken at regional assemblies as a councillor about how, geographically, half of the country does not have good broadband and people are driving miles to get their email by parking in the car parks or sitting in the lobbies of hotels to get free Wi-Fi, downloading emails, trying to run businesses so I call on the Leader to bring the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, to the House to discuss how broadband services will be rolled out.<\/p> <p>I regard broadband as being like electricity or running water.  It is essential in the 21st century and it would do a lot for the Minister's other portfolio of climate action because people would not be driving long distances to work in offices and incurring massive overheads for those companies when they would be much happier to get up and work at home.  Much research has been done to show that many people are more productive at home because they feel that because they are at home they need to prove their output.  It is not just about being present as outputs have to be measured.  They can do their work efficiently but, at the same time, bring their children to school and collect them and so on.  I ask the Leader to schedule the Minister to come in urgently and we can discuss the benefits we would have in terms of climate change by having remote working and allowing people to have a better quality of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#L00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I put on the record how sad I was to hear about Professor M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; S&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in's death this morning.

I refer to the old tradition of making a c&eacute;il&iacute;, as it was known in many parts of the country, or gathering at a c&eacute;il&iacute; house.  This was well known in many parts of the country for many years and indeed generations.  People came together to check on a neighbour or friend and to see how they were.<\/p> <p>With that in mind, I compliment Scotstown GAA club in County Monaghan.  For the second year in succession, the community there has come together to try to reinvigorate or reinvent the old tradition of the c&eacute;il&iacute; house.  People are encouraged to go out into their communities and visit older people who may be living alone and to visit friends in the community.  The help of three local national schools has also been enlisted.

On behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann I warmly welcome the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor Deirdre Hargey, who has been invited to address the House in accordance with Standing Order 57(2), which provides for addresses by representatives and persons in civic and public life.  She is accompanied by the chief executive of Belfast City Council, Ms Suzanne Wylie, who I also warmly welcome to the House.  I congratulate Ms Hargey on her election as Lord Mayor earlier this year and wish her well in her important role.  I also congratulate her on being the first Sinn F&eacute;in female mayor of Belfast.<\/p> <p>It is very timely for the House to hear from the Lord Mayor of Belfast in light of the current issues of mutual concern in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, including the current absence of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and the North-South Ministerial Council, as well as the impact of Brexit on the island as a whole.  I visited Belfast last week and had the pleasure of visiting Belfast City Hall, where I met the Lord Mayor and had an in-depth discussion with her on issues of mutual concern.  Although we debate many topics in this House, all Members agree that the Good Friday Agreement is the indispensable framework for relations on this island.  I am sure that will frame our discussion today, as it does all of our debates on Northern Ireland.  The success of the Good Friday Agreement in securing peace and harnessing the opportunities of that peace for people and communities North and South is perhaps one of the greatest achievements of our time.<\/p> <p>The challenges presented by the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union will be felt in all 27 remaining member states for many years to come and it goes without saying that the challenges for Ireland are immense.  The Government remains intensely engaged on Brexit, working closely with our EU partners to ensure that the agreement and the gains and benefits of the peace process are protected and upheld in the outcome of the Article 50 negotiations with the UK, not least in ensuring that there will be no hard border on the island.  These are issues of the utmost significance for our country and this House is intensely engaged on them.<\/p> <p>In recognition of the potential consequences of the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU, the Seanad established a special select committee to consider the implications of the withdrawal for Ireland and to suggest some possible solutions to identifiable problems.  To support its thinking and considerations, the committee organised nine days of public hearings with former taoisigh and Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade, sectoral experts, representatives of relevant organisations, local authorities, all-island bodies and many more.  It launched a report last year in the hope that it would inform the negotiations as member states worked to manage this event that has shaken the political landscape.<\/p> <p>Members will recall that the T&aacute;naiste took part in statements in the House on Brexit earlier this week.  We regularly consider matters pertaining to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  This reflects the fact that while the responsibility to uphold, protect and advance the Good Friday Agreement is for the two Governments as co-guarantors of the agreement, it is also one for all political representatives and parties North and South and across these islands.  Civic society, which does much to support and actualise the peace process and the task of reconciliation, also has an important role to play.  Members of this House participate in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and in the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association as important forums for exchange provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement also plays an important role in considering and informing debate on the agreement and on cross-Border co-operation.<\/p> <p>In the wider institutional and political context, it is worthwhile for the House to be addressed by the Lord Mayor, the elected leader of Belfast City Council.  It would be welcome for this House to hear from representatives of other city and county councils in Northern Ireland to inform our ongoing consideration of and engagement on matters pertaining to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement.  Like all local authorities, Belfast City Council has a very broad and important remit in the delivery of public services.  It also plays a vital role in addressing issues that can arise at community levels in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland following on from the legacy of the Troubles.  The work of the council in the area of good relations also contributes in a meaningful and direct way to the principles and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement, including the achievement of tolerance, mutual trust and reconciliation.  Although the North-South Ministerial Council cannot currently meet in the absence of the power-sharing Executive, fortunately, co-operation and exchange between local authorities North and South continues, as it always has, on a practical basis and in support of local and regional economies.<\/p> <p>B'fh&eacute;idir gur mhaith leis an Ardmh&eacute;ara cuid de na seacht gceisteanna seo a lua ina &oacute;r&aacute;id.

These are some of the issues which the Lord Mayor may wish to address in her speech.  With these welcoming introductory remarks, it is my pleasures to invite her to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

His contribution to the arts across the island of Ireland and beyond is worthy of great recognition.<\/p> <p>I am joined by the chief executive of Belfast City Council, Ms Suzanne Wylie.  We are delighted to be here and I, as Lord Mayor, am very pleased to have the opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This is an historic and symbolic occasion not only because it is the first time that a mayor of Belfast has addressed this forum but also because it gives me the opportunity to speak about the city I love.  It is a privilege to be here to speak about and represent Belfast and to look for potential links and collaborative working between us.  The invitation I received is a very important gesture of friendship between the Seanad, Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, the people represented by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people of Belfast and its elected city council.<\/p> <p>Belfast is Ireland's second city and we are the second-largest council on the island.  Belfast is changing and that is reflective of a changing Ireland.  The most notable and welcome change is that we now have peace.  I was 18 years of age when the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people of Ireland and I am glad to say that I voted \"Yes\" in that referendum.  It is against that backdrop that I, as mayor, and other elected members of Belfast City Council perform our daily duties and that I am here today.<\/p> <p>The Cathaoirleach visited me last week in Belfast ahead of today's historic address to talk about the link between our two main cities and the huge potential our cities could have in the time ahead.  Dublin and Belfast are two cities that, together, can accomplish much to benefit their people and Ireland as a whole.  At that meeting we discussed the foundation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2014 by the mayors of Dublin and Belfast and the opportunities that has given us through closer co-operation between the two cities and the strengthening of links along the economic corridor between them.  The Cathaoirleach and I affirmed that in Belfast last week.<\/p> <p>Other opportunities also present themselves in terms of Belfast working with other cities across the island, such as Galway, which will be the European capital of culture in 2020.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Deirdre Hargey:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Belfast bid for the European Capital of Culture but, unfortunately, because of the Brexit scenario, we could not proceed.  We do not want this to stop us, however.  We want to look at exploring cultural links, to work with Galway City Council and to develop these cultural links, not just across the island of Ireland, but in a European dimension as well.  We believe we can work with a variety of cities right across this island.  This is acutely important in the context of Brexit.  It is so important we continue to forge new and stronger bonds which encourage and spread ideas of knowledge, equality and prosperity.<\/p><p>I am set to launch my mayor's charter in December.  This declaration will set out what I am focusing on during my term in office under the theme \"a Belfast for all\".  The three pillars of my charter are equality, empowerment and prosperity.  Inclusive growth is the foundation to this, a crucial underpinning to ensure we focus on equality of outcome, not just equality of opportunity.  While developing this strategy I have engaged with local people across the city and key campaign groups that have taken to the streets in recent years to demand their equal rights with the rest of society.  I know that this merges with the campaigns that have taken to the streets of Dublin and the South overall.  I have heard many stories of inequality, class struggle, barriers to inclusion and denial of rights.<\/p><p>As the two largest cities in Ireland, Belfast and Dublin and the corridor between them drive much of our economic development.  We know that the full potential of the Dublin-Belfast corridor has yet to be realised.  The Belfast Agenda, our community plan for Belfast, sets out ambitious plans for our city to grow by 2035.  In the plan we said we would grow our city population by at least 66,000, making housing a priority, particularly much-needed social and public housing.  In Belfast we have a housing crisis, with up to 10,000 people on the waiting list.  I know that this matches with cities such as Dublin.  I believe we can work collectively to overcome these challenges and support families into much-needed housing.  We have also said we will support an additional 46,000 better paid jobs.  This is an increase of 20% in both housing and employment.<\/p><p>We also want to see the creation of a youth pledge which guarantees that every young person in the city of Belfast who leaves school at 16 will have a pathway.  They will be in education or move into employment or training and further upskilling.  Through our inclusive growth framework, our priorities are clear.  They are to create more and better jobs, promote investment, make life better for all residents, create a competitive and sustainable city and connect people to these opportunities.  I must stress again, however, the importance of creating equality of outcome and not just equality of opportunity if we are serious about connecting our most deprived communities to this growth.  We are ambitious for our city and focused on ensuring we deliver.  As we know, a Belfast that is thriving has an impact beyond the city boundaries.  If Belfast does well, we know that impact goes much further.  If Dublin and Belfast do well and we have that connection along the eastern corridor, the ripple effect will travel much further, particularly if we have inclusive growth as a key.<\/p><p>Having a vision in place helps us to articulate our case for support and investment at the highest level.  The Belfast Region City Deal is a significant part of the jigsaw in making our city work.  We are seeking to secure up to &euro;1 billion of co-investment over the next ten years with a real focus on innovation, regeneration led by digital tourism, and infrastructure to connect people to jobs and services.  Last week we heard the announcement that we have secured the first &pound;350 million in this city deal from the British Treasury.  This deal has an impact on a population of up to 1.1 million people living along the eastern seaboard in the North.  It stretches as far as Newry and can help build the economic corridor through to Dublin and beyond, with one of the key infrastructural projects being the southern relief road seeking to link Down with Louth.<\/p><p>We want to tap further into the growing tourism potential.  Belfast is a vibrant city.  Our tourism statistics show that overnight visitor stays have increased by 50%, overnight tourism spends have increased by 53% and the number of hotel rooms in Belfast has increased by 50%.  This year alone we have seen over &pound;150 million in hotel investments and the creation of more than 1,000 additional hotel rooms in the city.  Our Belfast tourism agenda goal is ambitious, doubling out-of-state visitor spend by generating 1.9 million overnight stays by 2021.  We are determined to make this happen.  The Belfast Waterfront Hall and convention centre was named best event space in 2017.  We have Titanic Belfast, the world's leading tourist attraction in 2016, and we are the Lonely Planet's number one tourist destination to visit in 2018.  Only this week, Belfast picked up the award for world's best food destination at the International Travel and Tourism Awards in London.<\/p><p>The strong collaborative spur between local government, communities, our businesses, educationalists and innovators sees us working hand in hand to deliver for the city.  We have a growing talent to be proud of.  We are home to two respected universities in Queen's University and Ulster University and two fantastic teacher training colleges in Stranmillis University College and St. Mary's University College, with links to sporting endeavours and pioneering in the development of Irish-medium educational resources for many schools, colleges and other institutions not just in the city but right across Ireland.  We also have Belfast Metropolitan College.  We have a young population, with a student population across the universities of around 80,000 young people.  We also have a well educated population, with 34% of our working population having a degree level or higher level of education.<\/p><p>Our communities are strong and evolving well after many years of conflict.  I have been personally involved in reconciliation work at a community level right across Belfast and its communities over many years.  I am regularly in the company of people from all backgrounds, whether political activists, elected representatives, community activists, trade unionists, church leaders or members of wider civic society.  In this regard, I commend Seanad&oacute;ir Marshall on his role in this Chamber and the distinctive contribution he makes in bringing to it a perspective of the unionist community, particularly that of people from a rural background.  The Seanad has a unique quality to it in that it can be home to many people living outside the boundaries of this State and who, in the case of Seanad&oacute;ir Marshall, may not share the broader constitutional aspirations of the Seanad.  He has a place in it, however, and, more important, a voice.  Seanad&oacute;ir Marshall, like Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Donnghaile, a former mayor and councillor for Belfast, have both brought a distinctive Northern experience and perspective to the Chamber, and I am sure this is to the benefit of both Houses and their Members, Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; and Deputies.<\/p><p>Belfast is a forward-thinking, dynamic and ambitious city driven by talent and ready to invest, promoting our city as an attractive place.  This is key in delivering our Belfast Agenda ambitions.  We have welcomed a number of high-profile investments over the past 12 months from a range of sectors, including financial services, cybersecurity, software and business services, and we are proud of our international relationships, which are bearing fruit.  We are delighted that State Street, for example, a global insurance firm with headquarters in our sister city of Boston and a turnover of $11.17 billion, has selected Belfast for its office location.  We have developed a competitive advantage and partnership, working in tandem with partners across the city, including Invest Northern Ireland, to develop brand Belfast as a location for a number of other global growth sector firms.  As such, we are hopeful for more positive announcements in the near future because Belfast is a city of aspiration and surprises.  We are the number one global destination for FinTech investment and the second most successful destination after London for attracting US tradeable services foreign direct investment, FDI, projects.  We are home to one of Europe's largest cybersecurity research centres, the Centre for Secure Information Technologies, CSIT, putting us front and centre of research and delivery.  We are also home to one of the fastest-growing creative clusters anywhere on these islands and two film studios.<\/p><p>I hope this gives the House an idea of the city in 2018 and our priorities ahead.  It shows we can be a strong partner to Dublin and cities such as Cork, Galway and Limerick and that collectively and collaboratively we can become a place that fosters talent, ideas and prosperity, qualities that will breed and strengthen new links.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Deirdre Hargey:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Brexit is a real challenge for my city as it is for us all.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I attended a rally in front of Belfast City Hall which saw thousands of people from across the political spectrum and all age groups, gender profiles and classes come together to raise their concerns and to reinforce the fact that the majority in the North voted to remain.  They were concerned that their voices were not being heard in the debate and they pushed for the Irish and British Governments to listen acutely to the voices of the population.  One of the unforeseen consequences of the Brexit referendum in the North, where 56% of voters want to remain in the EU, is that some who were traditionally opposed to Irish reunification but who desired to remain within the EU have become more open to a closer and new relationship with the rest of Ireland.  This is welcome and it is an important and crucial part of the debate on what Ireland and its relationships could look like in future and in any new configuration that comes.<br\/><br\/>A national conversation is required to discuss a new Ireland and what it could look like socially, economically, politically and culturally.  I call on the Irish Government to start to prepare talks in this regard.  How can we work together to ensure we build equality and prosperity for all on this island, not least our many rural communities and deprived communities?  How can we approach collectively issues, including health, tourism, infrastructure, structural inequality and housing, to name but a few?  How can our cities across the island deliver in this regard?  We all need to be assured that a new Ireland with new relationships will be a secure and prosperous place to live with equality at the core of its foundations.  Unionists, in particular, need assurance that any constitutional change will not threaten their standard of living or British identity.  As evidenced by the letter published in the <i>Irish New<\/i>s this week, Irish citizens in the North need reassurance that their rights, identity and entitlements will also be protected and upheld.  A positive expression of this advance will be the holding of next year's referendum on presidential voting rights for many like me and the thousands of Irish citizens in my city who want to play their part in electing their Uachtar&aacute;n.  I wish the House well in its endeavours to make this a reality.  In that regard, I congratulate President Michael D. Higgins on his re-election.  We have his portrait in the parlour in Belfast City Hall and I wish him well in his term of office.<br\/><br\/>The partition of Ireland is almost 100 years old.  It not only separated us geographically though the Border; it separated us from each other in our minds and in how we think about the society in which we grew up after 1921.  Progress is being made to overcome this particular mindset and there is no doubt that my presence here is a good example of that.  Thinking outside our respective 1921 state boundaries is a challenge for all of us but the lesson from the peace process and the remarkable changes throughout this island prove, in the words of Nelson Mandela, that the impossible always seems impossible until it is done.  My role as Mayor of Belfast is to ensure we build on the links established and continue to build on the relationships and trust which are crucial.  Our memorandum recognises that a significant proportion of the future economic growth of the island of Ireland will occur along the eastern corridor.  Our developing cities are the pillars which will uphold that corridor.  We want to see that growth used to benefit our communities and those communities beyond our city boundaries, not least the long-forgotten communities in the west.  It is my firm and passionate belief that a strong and vibrant Belfast will do what it must to make this happen.  We are up for the engagement and for the collaboration and partnership work with the Members of the House, Dublin City Council and other local authorities right across the island.<br\/><br\/>We must continue to build on the memorandum of understanding and to do so effectively.  We have been working hard to develop and grow our city, boosting the opportunities available through collaboration.  I want to continue to boost our efforts to attract and expand trade and investment along the economic corridor.  We will work in tandem on the continuing development of our cities and with other towns and cities.  We must sell all of Ireland together.  We must showcase ourselves as part of a vibrant ecosystem and as a single investment location in which we are all part of the same proposition so that all of our people feel the benefit of the resulting growth.  We want to continue to break down barriers to travel, promoting intercity tourists and non-tourists alike.  We want to encourage the movement of students and greater collaboration to encourage visitors to see a combined and attractive offer.  Ireland is changing for the better.  The North of Ireland and Belfast City Council are part of that change.  The common denominator of this change is the desire of people to live in a more equal, prosperous, secure, fair and respectful society.  Whether at council, regional or state level, it is our job as political activists to marry people's aspirations with the institutions which govern their lives.  We can do that.  I thank the Members for the opportunity to come to the House to speak and for their continued commitment to harnessing this relationship.  I look forward to developing future links and invite all Members to visit B&eacute;al Feirste soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hargey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank the Lord Mayor for a very in-depth speech.

Today is historic and it is great that the Lord Mayor has been able to address the Seanad.  Having done some research on her, I see that she has done a great deal of work on women's rights and that she supports marriage equality.  She has done a great deal of work to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to which she is strongly committed.  I was 16 years old when the Agreement was entered into and I remember going through it line by line with my late father.  In the wake of Brexit, all our sentiments and rhetoric must be directed to ensuring the Good Friday Agreement does not break down.  We must do everything possible to mitigate any fallout from Brexit.<\/p><p>The Lord Mayor spoke about creating stronger cultural bonds and links between both our cities.  She spoke passionately about Belfast and I would like to think I have the same commitment to and passion for my own city of Dublin.  I am born and bred a Dub.  I have visited the Lord Mayor's beautiful city and would love to see it again.  We would all be delighted to visit its council chamber and I thank her for that invitation.<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  The Lord Mayor referred to a commitment from various banks, including State Street Bank.  She might note on her way out today that downstairs in Leinster House 2000, the Fearless Girl statue, which was commissioned by that bank, is here.  It is very fitting to have it here today, especially as Ms Hargey is the first female Lord Mayor of Belfast.  It characterises the day that is in it and it is a very nice piece.<\/font><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We commend the Lord Mayor's work on reconciliation and on working with the various groups in Northern Ireland.

There is much merit in continuing the relationships between council members and politicians North and South, not just at senior levels but at every level of political life.

I wish we could have a little of that down here.<\/p> <p>I am looking at the Lord Mayor's manifesto and I am particularly struck by her interest in women's needs and the desire to ensure the health of women in a just society and encouraging trust of women.  I am particularly concerned about the mental health of women from the distant past on all sides of the traditions in Northern Ireland.  Siobh&aacute;n Fenton wrote an excellent book, which I read during the summer, on the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the areas she said has yet to be dealt with is the mental health issues of women in particular who were victims of the Troubles.  In welcoming the Lord Mayor to Dublin, I ask that she would make that a special interest across all communities.  There were women who suffered badly through no fault of their own and I ask her to take that issue on board.<\/p> <p>On same-sex marriage, I learned recently on a visit to Northern Ireland that across the community, up to the age of 40 or 45, nobody seems to have a problem with same-sex marriage.  I ask the Lord Mayor to keep that wheel moving in the direction in which it is going.  Nobody died in this part of the jurisdiction when we brought in marriage equality, and it brought great happiness to families that had been waiting years to see relationships between their children regularised in a proper marital relationship.  I am delighted to see that, and I know the Leader, who is in the Chamber, can speak for that also.<\/p> <p>Irish-language rights is an issue that confuses me greatly.  Linda Ervine is doing tremendous work in Northern Ireland in terms of the teaching and understanding of the Irish language.  I had great pleasure visiting her centre earlier in the year.  I will be honest and say I was somewhat embarrassed that my level of Irish was not sufficiently good to communicate with the people in that centre.  The Irish language is the property of the people of Ireland, not any particular jurisdiction, religion or group.  It belongs to all of us.  It is part of our heritage, but I recognise that Scots Gaelic is also part of the heritage of Northern Ireland and recognising that is extremely important.  I commend the Lord Mayor on wanting to bring the language forward.<\/p> <p>I am somewhat dismayed at the lack of an assembly in Northern Ireland.  We need an assembly to come together and if there is anything the Lord Mayor can do, as a senior member of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, to ensure that happens, I would ask her to do that.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge her interest in the rights of Travellers.  My colleague, Senator Ruane, and her colleagues in the Civic Engagement group are working to bring forward a Bill to ensure that Traveller culture is brought into the syllabus of the Irish education system.<\/p> <p>On workers' rights, I come from a trade union background and, unfortunately, the zero-hours contract is the latent aspect of what was very positive legislation from Europe.  We see workers in all jurisdictions being crucified with zero-hours contracts.  They must sit at home and wait for the phone to ring.  I commend the Lord Mayor on taking that as one of her manifesto issues and sincerely hope she will have success in ending this curse of the exploitation of workers in all areas of this country, not just in the North of Ireland.<\/p> <p>On the right to housing, the Lord Mayor stated there are 10,000 people in Belfast waiting for a house.  One person in Belfast waiting for a house is a tragedy; 10,000 is unacceptable.  We have the same problem at this end.<\/p> <p>On class-based disadvantage, I did not start out with a silver spoon in my mouth.  We have worked hard in this part of the world to end class-based disadvantage.  Sadly, it is a feature of life on the island of Ireland, not just in the North, and it is an issue on which we must work hard.<\/p> <p>On Brexit, none of us on this island wants Brexit.  I wrote an article the day after the referendum advising that there will be a need to manage a border on this island.  I know that is repugnant to the Lord Mayor and to anybody who wants free travel in this country.  I want that, but I cannot see any way a third country will have an open border with the European Union and until such time as I am convinced otherwise, that will remain my view.  For that reason alone, it is vitally important that the Lord Mayor is in the Seanad today and that she maintains relationships with all the mayors in the Republic and in the North of Ireland.  Brexit is the one issue that can tear this island apart again and bring us back to times none of us wants to revisit.  I ask the Lord Mayor to do everything she can to ensure that, irrespective of whether it is a hard, soft or any other kind of Brexit, whatever else we do, we maintain our relationships and continue to work together to try to understand each other better.<\/p> <p>I welcome the Lord Mayor to Dublin and thank her for her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#U00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The Lord Mayor is very welcome to the Seanad today.  As she rightly said, it is an historic and symbolic occasion.  The Seanad is much richer for having the Lord Mayor here and we need more of these new engagements and relationships.<\/p> <p>I was thinking about Belfast and Dublin 100 years ago.  One hundred years ago, Belfast was a larger city than Dublin but Dublin now has three times the population of Belfast.  What has happened in Belfast in the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement, and in the island of Ireland, has been truly significant.  We must protect and enhance all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>I live in Boyle, County Roscommon, in the west.  In terms of our links, 100 years ago Boyle was the home of the Connaught Rangers.  It is a little known fact that 1,000 young men from nationalist Catholic west Belfast joined the Connaught Rangers to go to fight in the First World War.  The 6th Connaught Rangers Research Group did a great deal of good work on that.  I was not aware of that history until I became Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  At the time, the island of Ireland was effectively a single unit in the British Empire but 200,000 people from the island of Ireland went to fight in the First World War, 50,000 of whom died.  Thirty thousand of those young men were from the Republic and we did not recognise the sacrifices they made, although in some ways we have come of age in that regard in recent years.<\/p> <p>I want to pay tribute to Deputy Crowe of Sinn F&eacute;in who, as Irish Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, was in Westminster with fellow colleagues and laid a wreath with his British Co-Chair, Andrew Rosindell, MP.  That was a hugely significant moment and I want to thank the Lord Mayor and the other people involved for making those gestures.  They are not easy to make but they are very welcome.<\/p> <p>My grandfather was from Boyle.  One hundred years ago, he was on trial in Belfast courthouse for republican activities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those links between my area and Belfast were the same.

Other colleagues have rightly acknowledged the presence of Belfast City Council CEO, Suzanne Wylie, another champion for the new and better Belfast.  I also extend my thanks and appreciation, through the Leas-Chathaoirleach, to the Cathaoirleach, the Leader of the Seanad and the other Seanadoir&iacute; who made this visit possible.<\/p> <p>I think we all get it.  We all appreciate, not least given the climate we are in, the significance and importance of having such a visit today.  Today is one of those days when the Seanad and we, as Members, can display the leadership this nation and its people need.  Today, the Seanad is a warm house for the people Deirdre represents in Belfast City Council, the Nationalist and Unionist people and the increasing number of people our city welcomes from a range of different political, cultural, ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.  In Deirdre, that changing, diverse and wonderfully authentic Belfast are all represented in this Chamber today.  Today, the Seanad is a microcosm of Ireland and also of Ireland&rsquo;s diverse and rich tapestry of people.  We are a shared institution, one that welcomes people, voices and views which do not always get the chance to be heard, but which can be heard through our Seanad.<\/p> <p>This is very important because Ireland is in transition, shaped by a process, in particular a political process, with the Irish Government in a central and lead role, as is required by today&rsquo;s political circumstances and citizens' expectations.  Deirdre&rsquo;s presence and the presence of Seanad&oacute;ir Marshall and, indeed, my own contribution here, demonstrate the importance of this institution to the people of the North.  Only this week, 1,000 people from many influential backgrounds in the North appealed directly to the Taoiseach to protect and guarantee their rights and the rights of all of the people of the North, including those who want to leave the EU, in this most precarious period around Brexit.  As touched on by Senator Craughwell, this includes the people Deirdre has committed to championing during her term in office - those who want an Acht na Gaeilge, want marriage equality, access to proper and appropriate healthcare for women and access to truth and legacy mechanisms.  I commend the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste for their positive response to the recent appeal from the North and their repeated assurance that the people of the North will never again be abandoned.  We know political and civic leaders like Deirdre will hold them to account in that regard.<\/p> <p>The Seanad has clearly shown today a very good example of what this assurance can mean in practice.  I assure the Leas-Chathaoirleach that the people of Belfast and across the North are delighted by what they see occurring here today.  The Seanad and the D&aacute;il are important institutions in the lives of the people of this State but they are also very important institutions for the people of the North.  The presence of the &Aacute;rdmh&eacute;ara and her speech reflect that reality but they also reflect the changing realities of our city and the demands from the people there.  I am inspired by the theme for her time in office - empowerment, equality and prosperity - universal sentiments that all of us in political and civic life should aspire to seeing realised fully.  Stronger links between all the institutions on this island which serve our citizens and help to govern people&rsquo;s lives make sense on many fronts, not least on the economic front.  We can see from the emphasis in Deirdre&rsquo;s speech just how important both of our main councils in Dublin and Belfast will be, working together for the people who live along the eastern corridor and the positive reverberations that can be felt from that throughout Ireland.  This economic collaboration is important at any time but it is particularly important in this crisis-driven Brexit period.  Considered, agreed and implemented island-wide, economic co-operation will go some way to restoring confidence in local, regional and State economies at this time of deep uncertainty.<\/p> <p>There is a phrase in Irish: n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile &ndash; strength in unity.  That strength in unity is evident in the Seanad with Deirdre&rsquo;s presence today.  Again, go raibh c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le maith agat.  I thank her and the Seanad.  Like other Seanadoir&iacute;, I believe her presence is timely, given, as Senator Ardagh noted, the location of the Fearless Girl statute here.  She is a fearless girl, she is a fearless woman, she is fearless republican, she is a fearless Market woman and a fearless &Aacute;rdmh&eacute;ara.  We thank her for her contribution and her work, and we wish her every success in the time ahead.  I assure her we will take her up on the invitation to continue and build upon that engagement between her elected institution and this one, between our own city and Dublin.  Go raibh c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le maith agat on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#V00600","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Pat Buckley in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.

I have performed at the West Belfast Festival and in the opera house there and I have wonderful memories.<\/p><p>These initiatives are particularly important at a time of deep political uncertainty and particularly with Brexit looming.  I am privileged to be a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as well as the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  This has been a focus of mine over the past year and it really breaks my heart that so much of our time and of our social and political energy is being spent on defending against the impact of Brexit, time that should be spent on the wonderful social and cultural potential that exists in our cities.  We all realise how important it is and it is right that we make it a priority.<\/p><p>Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the reckless pursuit of a hard Brexit by many of those in leadership roles has put serious pressure on the Good Friday Agreement.  I firmly believe elected representatives need to show dedication, bravery and unwavering commitment to protecting it.  We talk of progress on a final deal ahead of the March 2019 deadline.  We cannot accept those who speak flippantly about the Good Friday Agreement when one considers the progress it has brought and the absolute necessity of avoiding a hard border.  Thankfully, this is one of those issues on which we see unanimous support across the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On this point I want to give credit to the Government and, in particular, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, for his work during the Brexit negotiations.  A legally operable backstop fully supported by the European Union is vital to protecting peace on our shared island.  That point has been made clearly and coherently and I am positive that we will see it reflected in any final deal.<\/p><p>One of the more positive and inspiring aspects of our work on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been our outreach to community groups in east and west Belfast and we have gone on many trips there and it has been an amazing experience.  It has had a great impact on the committee's membership.  I found it especially moving as someone who has spent so many years in the community sector.  The work that has been carried out on peace and reconciliation, the slow ordinary everyday work, the process of reaching out across divides and pushing for co-operation is deeply inspiring and a real cause for hope.  The RISE Foundation in which I work has run cross-Border, cross-community programmes.  To be involved in that has been an incredible experience, watching cross-community work, particularly around mental health issues, and cross-Border work, where people from the South have listened to stories from both communities, the reality of what it was like during the conflict, and the legacy of the mental health issues that have come out of the conflict with addiction, depression and anxiety.  At the end of the day, people have to deal with these issues on an equal basis.<\/p><p>This draws on the bigger and broader aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, recognising that it is not just a political or diplomatic agreement and that it is an aspirational document outlining a vision for a transformed and shared society.  When we saw the huge turnout and support for it 20 years ago right across this island, it was not just a vote for peace.  It was a vote for regeneration, opportunity, empowerment and co-operation and for an improvement to the basic material conditions of everyday life.  It was an endorsement of a society that protects the rights of all citizens and how that can help provide the education, employment, healthcare and housing needed for human dignity and flourishing.  As elected representatives, this is something we must remember.  We need to recognise how much work still needs to be done to deliver on these aspirations.  I have raised this issue in this Chamber.  I attended an event in St. Mary's in Belfast earlier this year and I was struck by some of the contributions, particularly one from a young member of the LGBT community.  He spoke so passionately about the barriers and discrimination that still exist and the need for greater equality.  It is a message that should resonate in Dublin and in Belfast and I am glad to see young people leading that change.  All across Ireland we are seeing a new generation of young people who are more willing than ever to stand up for their rights and to drive social change and I met many of them in Belfast.<\/p><p>Under the Good Friday Agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated into domestic law into the North of Ireland, prohibiting discrimination on a wide array of grounds.  In 2010, it was joined by the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union with a particularly important focus on workers rights, socio-economic support and anti-discrimination.  These are hard-won vital protections that must be enjoyed equally by every person on this island, in Dublin, in Belfast and everywhere else.  It is a point I have made consistently as a member of the Good Friday committee but it bears repeating.  If Brexit means a repeal of the Human Rights Act which underpins these protections in the North, then we must ensure that it does not bring any reduction whatsoever in terms of human rights standards.  The protections that exist must continue, be legally enforceable and be equivalent on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p>Occasions like this give us an opportunity to make that point firmly, so I am very grateful that the Lord Mayor is here today to draw upon the historic and hugely positive links between Dublin and Belfast and to reaffirm our commitment to continuing them.  The Lord Mayor has given such a wonderful account of the city she loves and I would like to thank her most sincerely as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann agus gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas di and congratulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#V00800","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Before calling on the next speaker, I welcome Elisha McCallion, MP, for Foyle to the Chamber.

I am delighted the Lord Mayor is here as the role of Lord Mayor is about providing leadership right across the community.  I know that she has been doing that since she has been elected to office.  It is important that we work together on that role.  We need to do much more on a joint approach between Northern Ireland and the Republic in terms of exchanges between local communities in different cities, with the farming, business communities, tourism and sport.  We have made much progress over the last 25 to 30 years on that issue but we can do much more, especially with younger people.<\/p> <p>When the Washington programme was set up young people from the Protestant and nationalist communities spent a period of time in Washington working together.

It is a very educational and helpful and is something we should work on.<\/p> <p>A number of years ago I was involved in an exchange between political groups in Northern Ireland and my area in Cork and it was very effective in understanding the difficulties and different challenges we face.  Many of the challenges are the same in different parts of the country.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise how important the role of the Lord Mayor of Cork is.  We lost two Lord Mayors in 1920.  Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain was shot in his own home on the orders of the RIC and Terence MacSwiney who succeeded him and who died while on hunger strike in Brixton Prison.  They were two tragedies for Cork but they showed the respect for the job of Lord Mayor of Cork city.  One of the legacies Terence MacSwiney left was that while he was Lord Mayor, he visited every school in the city.  That is a legacy that has remained to this day and it provides a huge opportunity for young people to engage with the political process.  It is something we should develop in other areas, namely, that direct connection between those elected and young people as they come through the system.  If one goes to school in Cork city, by the time one is finished in education, one has met 14 Lord Mayors.  It is a huge opportunity for people to engage and it is something we should encourage.<\/p> <p>I am delighted that the Lord Mayor of Belfast is here and I thank her for the work she has done to date as Lord Mayor and I wish her well for the remaining term of her office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#W00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte U&iacute; Cheallaigh roimh Ard-Mh&eacute;ara Bh&eacute;al Feirste, Comhairleoir Hargey.

I welcome the mayor wholeheartedly to the Chamber and I compliment my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, who put the matter forward in the first place.  Such communication, conversation and association between us is very welcome.  I am delighted to get such a positive report from our Cathaoirleach, Senator O'Donovan, from his trip north, and I hope Ms Hargey will find her visit to us equally rewarding.  She referred to the great progress that has been made in her native city of Belfast.  There is no question or doubt about it that it is wonderful to see that beautiful city of Belfast coming back proud, buoyant and forward-looking, mainly, in our time, as a result of the cessation of violence.  People from the South who did not go north during the Troubles are taking advantage of the peace process to visit not only Belfast but all of the Six Counties.  I do so regularly.  I have very fond memories of Belfast from when I was in education.  I had close associations with the teacher training college in St. Joseph's.  I have relations in Enniskillen.  It is a beautiful town.  It is certainly the jewel of the North of Ireland and I would like to see that continue.<\/p> <p>I am delighted to hear the mayor say she is working hard for reconciliation because that is the most important part of her work.  We have seen examples of reconciliation in the South and in the North and we need to see more of it.  I was talking to Senator Marshall just before we came in and telling him that my own town of Listowel, in the height of the Troubles, was twinned with Downpatrick.  We had many guests.  The mayors of Downpatrick tended to be either unionists or occasionally from the SDLP.  We found out that they did not have horns on their heads and they found out that we were okay.  They have a racetrack and we have a racetrack.  We were able to build on that in a small way.<\/p> <p>The mayor has a huge responsibility insofar as she has a high profile in elected office in the North where there is a political vacuum and political wilderness.  This is not the occasion to attribute blame and I will not attribute blame except to say that neither side is blameless for that.  We want them in the Assembly and I know Ms Hargey would want to see that restored immediately.  We do not have nationalist representation in Westminster and 100 years ago, Joseph Devlin represented Belfast Falls and 100 years later, it is sad to say that we have no one over there at a crucial time for Brexit.  It has never been more important.  Our former President, Mary Robinson, warned yesterday that she is fearful about a resurgence of violence in the North if a hard border comes back.  I mentioned that here two weeks ago and was shouted down about it by certain quarters.  It is an issue which we have to be careful about and work together on.  The mayor's visit is a good day's work and she is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#X00100","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Hargey and congratulate her on her powerful, historic address.  My colleague from the Civil Engagement Group, of which I am a leader, spoke very clearly about the vote taken on the Good Friday Agreement being a choice made not simply for peace and political solutions but for community engagement and co-operation, rights, and a vision of society at the time.  I will perhaps begin with the point at which she ended her contribution.  It is important that we are clear on all of those pillars of the Good Friday Agreement which she spoke about, especially the commitment on rights and the mechanisms relating to the vindication and protection of human rights and the rights of all those across this island.  The equivalence of human rights in that commitment is important.  I am glad to see in the Brexit negotiations that the key pillar of human rights, which has been somewhat to the side, is now entering centre stage.  It is appropriate when we are at the anniversary of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is good to see that we are not simply looking backwards with regard to rights but looking forward.  As Ms Hargey mentioned, even in the shadow of difficult challenges and changed imposed by Brexit, we see positive change being talked about and positive demands for constructive futures.  It is important to recognise that some of those changes will be very positive with regard to issues such as access to reproductive rights, equality of outcome and not just opportunity, and marriage equality.  It is positive to see that we have co-operation from this House with Members of Parliament such as Stella Creasy and others in the UK and with many activists in movements in Northern Ireland to ensure that we take the commitment to rights seriously.<\/p> <p>The equivalence with regard to human rights is something we will want to see matched with equivalence in the environment and in employment standards.  I can tell from Ms Hargey's speech that she is not simply looking at the idea of equivalence and to ensure that the European standards which have been met will continue to be met for everybody in these areas but that she is ambitious for what the standards might be and what we might do for our societies.  I love the idea of Belfast, Dublin and the other cities on this island working together to raise standards in these areas of sustainability, employment and a decent society.  We should have our ambition there.<\/p> <p>Ms Hargey spoke of the many connections.  There are connections, aside from the political and even in times of political uncertainty, in sport, education, unions and the civic connection which Ms Hargey spoke about.  She reached out to other cities and both urban and rural communities.  It was very moving that she spoke not only of Belfast but the area around it, and the relationship a city has with the rural communities around it.  Lastly, I want to speak to the cultural and historical connection.  I am a member of the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 committee and we are at the centenary of suffrage.  We had Winifred Carney in the North and Constance Markievicz, who were ground-breaking at that time, as Ms Hargey has been ground-breaking as mayor.  I look forward to commemorating these issues in a way that is positive and empowering and to working with Ms Hargey to paint a picture for a future of that co-operation across the past, through the difficulties of the present, and to paint an ambitious picture for the future, for all of us on our island.  I look forward to further co-operation.  I thank Ms Hargey for joining us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#X00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I commend the Cathaoirleach of this House on his work to establish this important series of events that will see the first citizens from across this island address this House.

It is a city we have great affection towards and which is, from our experience, safe to be open, public and visible.  We feel a real sense of belonging there, given its diversity.  Despite legislation unreflective of public opinion on the issue of civil marriage equality, our Seanad team regularly visits Belfast.  In 2017, Anne McReynolds gave us a tour of the Metropolitan Arts Centre in Belfast and we saw first-hand through her enthusiasm and passion how Belfast elevates and embraces the creativity of its people.  Culture and the arts can always be used as a tool to divide.  This has been true in the past but culture is constantly evolving.  Art is a response to that culture and great or important art eventually becomes our heritage but only the people can decide what is great.  This is probably most visible on the walls and in the streets of Belfast where visitors, world-renowned artists, come from across the globe not only to witness this street art but to partake and create.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Tourism, the arts, culture and film are significant contributors to the economy.

I hope this stands us in good stead in the months and years to come of harnessing and developing the relationships.  If Brexit has taught us anything, it is to really focus on having those relationships.  Creating those relationships and building on the trust is fundamental because at the end, it will be to the benefit of all citizens right across the island.<\/p> <p>To reflect, Brexit and the Border is a massive issue.  It is on the tip of everyone's tongue every single day, in my city and right across the island.  The Good Friday Agreement is fundamental in the sense that it was a referendum in which all people across the island voted overwhelming for that peace agreement.  Growing up and living in a city that has been torn apart by political conflict and division, I can see the massive benefits of that agreement even in these short 20 years.  As someone with a background of reconciliation work with former combatants and with communities that are segregated and divided, I am aware that the absence of armed conflict does not always result in peace and one must build the peace.  The consequences of Brexit could unravel that.  I do not say that lightly but there are massive concerns because the peace process is in its infancy.  It is a young process, only 20 years in the making.  The process is something that is held in international regard but we still need to nurture it and Brexit could have a massive detrimental impact on it.<\/p> <p>As a city that is trying to move forward, and I know that is shared right across the island, this is a big concern, particularly for our young people in the time ahead.  When we are looking to grow the economy, we do not want to chase away that young talent.  We want to retain it, within our cities and within our communities as well.<\/p> <p>I stress again the crucial role of the Irish Government and the Seanad in representing people, right across the North and across the island, but particularly being wedded to the Good Friday Agreement as a co-guarantor.  I was thinking back when somebody spoke in terms of the image of a place.  I thought back to the Carrickdale Hotel, just right at the Border, prior to the Good Friday Agreement, where I attended a team-building residential meeting with a number of women's organisations from right across the North.  At that point, there were still army checkpoints in south Armagh.  One could see them from the Carrickdale Hotel.  I remember sitting in the hotel that night.  Two residents from just beyond Dublin came up to stay in the hotel and when they realised there was a British army checkpoint or station post on the mountain, they checked out that night because they were so fearful of going near the North.  We do not want to go back to those times.  It has taken us 20 years to change the international image of the city and society and we do not want anything that will set us back.<\/p> <p>I listened closely to the points regarding the Commonwealth of Nations.  When one is starting to look at what a new Ireland could look like, all options must be on the table.  All options need to be discussed.  We need to look at what brings most of the people right across the island together, including those who are unionists particularly, nationalists and those who do not assign to anything.  All those options need to be discussed and on the table.<\/p> <p>In terms of retaining relationships post Brexit, it is crucial, no matter what the outcome, for us to focus and build on the relationships even more to ensure we are building strong foundations for whatever comes in the time ahead.  I have met the mayors of both Dublin and Cork over recent months in this post, predominantly in respect of remembrance events at Islandbridge, as well as when the Pope came to Ireland.  I agree with the comments that we need to move beyond those events, in terms of looking at social implications and economic connections of our cities and really starting to forge and build links around those key issues.<\/p> <p>I also will meet the Lord Mayor of Dublin later today to build on the memorandum of understanding we have between our two cities.  In respect of infrastructure, we are considering a high-speed rail connection between Belfast and Dublin.  A feasibility study is being looked at, the local authorities that span the corridor between Belfast and Dublin have put funding into it and I would like to come back to give the Seanad updates.  That is only one example of the growth and connection that we can look at.<\/p> <p>We want to retain our connections with Europe as well.  That is critical to us, as an island.  I will be representing Belfast - other cities across the island will attend - at the Eurocities conference in Edinburgh at the end of this month where there will be a conversation on the role of cities in emerging social, political and economical life.  Indeed, I would encourage any of the other cities across the island to attend that conference.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Ms Deirdre Hargey:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am always open to further engagement with them.  <\/p><p>The issue of rights is something that is very much to the fore of why the institutions have not been re-established and has also seen thousands of people take to the streets in front of the building in which I sit, City Hall, in recent years, whether these rights are in language, LGBT, marriage equality, women or those around legacy and dealing with the past.  These are not orange and green issues, which is critical.  We cannot just pigeon hole them or sectarianise them into orange and green issues.   Rights are international, they are universal and impact on all citizens.  This is a conversation we need to have.  The one reason I launched a mayor&rsquo;s charter on rights in the city was to lift that debate.  One critical factor in the Good Friday Agreement was the introduction of a bill of rights, but this is still yet to materialise.  Had that been introduced, many of these issues that people in my city are out on the streets campaigning about would have been covered by this.  I want to play my part in working with those organisations.  I will launch it on 10 December which is Human Rights Day and the 70th anniversary of the signing of the charter.  That will examine various issues around women and mental health, which was touched on, which is a massive issue.  More people in the North have died by suicide since the Good Friday Agreement was signed than all those who died as a result of the political conflict.  That is a vast issue that we must address.<\/p><p>Looking at gender, the British Government has not signed up to UN Resolution 1325, there is no action plan for the North around women&rsquo;s issues or gender principles around female representation in politics, on bodies, mental health or community participation which is another thing that we need to encourage.  The British Government needs to sign up to these.  The Irish Government is implementing these action plans but there is a vacuum in the North where it is probably needed most.  Any influence that can be brought to bear in this would be crucial. <\/p><p>I now turn to reconciliation.  The Connaught Rangers is one area.  I have done much work in Belfast City Council and in the city on the need for remembrance and addressing the decade of centenaries.  Belfast City Council adopted a very positive approach.  After the election in 2011 we agreed a set of principles because we knew that the decade of centenaries was coming.  These included the Battle of the Somme, the 1916 Easter Rising, the signing of the Ulster Covenant, to name but a few, that could have heightened tensions or led to conflict on the streets of Belfast.  I am glad to say that all the political parties in Belfast City Council, across the spectrum, signed up to a set of principles in which we could mark all those occasions and look at them in their wider context, looking at them through perspectives of gender and class and from an international perspective.  Something that I never thought I would see in my lifetime was Belfast City Council hosting three civic dinners, one to mark the signing of the Ulster Covenant in 1912, and two dinners in 1916, one to mark the Easter Rising and another for the Battle of the Somme.  <\/p><p>We are now moving to look at the memorabilia in the building and how it can be made more reflective to ensure that it looks at all backgrounds and narratives. The figure of Winifred Carney well reflects this, for instance, her story, and the complexity of her past is not black and white but more layered and complex.  There is my chain of office which features the words \"Erin go Bragh\" whereas that of the Dublin Lord Mayor features King William.  Some seem to think the two were switched but it illustrates the complexity.  We have a deep and shared history and one which we all own and we must all own the future.  Winifred Carney was an Irish republican from Belfast who was in the GPO in 1916 with James Connolly.  Her future husband, George McBride, was a UVF volunteer, an Orangeman also from Belfast who, during 1916, was fighting with the British at the Battle of the Somme.  They both returned to Belfast, where they were both trade union activists who worked with the city&rsquo;s poor and they met, fell in love and were married.  It is a beautiful story which goes to sum up the complexity of our past and also gives hope for the future.  <\/p><p>Dialogue is the big factor in reconciliation.  We need to get to know one another.  I see this in Belfast when dealing with interface tension, where communities are at a street that divides the two communities.  They do not know each other or the issues that impact the other.  We have learned over time that dialogue, getting to know one another and the fact that I am hearing the Members&rsquo; perspective here today, and they are hearing mine, may widen our horizons and thoughts, and may push buttons or perceptions that we have.  When we get to know each other, that is how we build trust, and that trust is how one can reach agreements and compromises.  That is what is needed for the institutions.  We need the institutions to be up and running but they must do so on solid foundations.  We need to resolve the outstanding issues, particularly the implementation of those around the rights enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  If that does not happen, people will be outside City Hall demanding their rights.<\/p><p>This is an opportunity.  It is historic and as a city and a council we are keen to strengthen our engagements and connections with other towns and cities across the island.  We want to look at the tourism and trade potential that lifts the prosperity of all our citizens with inclusive growth which is key.  We want to look at infrastructure, roads and train networks.  There is nothing to say that if this was achieved between Dublin and Belfast it could not be expanded to Derry to Cork and across to Galway or beyond.  We want to look at innovation and research to ensure that when Ireland, as an island, puts itself forward internationally, that we are seen as a real hub of innovation and advanced research and how that has an impact on advanced manufacturing.<\/p><p>Tourism was referred to.  There is massive potential in this area.  As a city, we want to double our tourism spending by 2020.  With Tourism Ireland we have gone to the market as one and went to China on a joint trade mission.  The benefits have already been seen in the Chinese market.  On educational links, we know that there are many students from Belfast who are studying in Dublin.  If the infrastructure was dealt with, there would be nothing to stop them commuting between the two cities.  That applies to education and to business.<\/p><p>There is great potential in culture, which could be in areas such as the European Capital of Culture or other cultural programmes, and deepen the understanding of what is offered across the island.  We can look at opportunities for how we can collectively promote the island through our cultural offerings.  Arts play a critical role in that.  There is a campaign in the North called Arts Matter, which emphasises the impact of the arts and investment.  This is something we want to build on because as well as its social and economic impact, it also has an impact on building reconciliation, the peace process and using art as a way of breaking down barriers or fears and perceptions.  <\/p><p>The opportunity is there to use our cities to make those connections and look at the inclusion of the surrounding areas so that they also feel the benefit.  We are doing this for our young people, for the next generation, for those who have talent and aspirations to ensure that they have a future and that it is on the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Hargey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank the Lord Mayor and invite the Leader to make some concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach, an Ard Mh&eacute;ara, na comhairleoir&iacute; agus na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;.

As I understand it, the intent of amendment No. 66 is to amend the introductory part of section 27(1) to provide that there has to be written consent for the disclosure of confidential information.  Amendment No. 66 proposes - it is phrased peculiarly - to insert \"without the consent in writing of the Commission or (save where the intending discloser is the Director) the Director or except as required by law or in the circumstances provided for in subsection (3)\".  What I think the proposed amendment is trying to achieve is if the director proposed to make a disclosure, he would have to have the permission of the commission.  I think that is what it is driving at.  Strangely, it seems that if a member of the staff of the director, or a member of staff directed by the director, disclosed the information, that person would not require the permission of the commission.  It seems to be somewhat illogical that the commission must give consent in writing if the director intends to disclose something but a member of staff can obtain permission from the director without the commission's intervention, providing that the director puts it in writing.  I wonder if that is really what is intended.  It seems that the only member of staff who actually needs permission from the commission is the director and that members of staff, other than the director, or people who are not even members of staff for that matter because it applies to \"a person\" and could apply, for instance, to the so-called consultants and advisers do not have to have the permission of the commission.  They can do it on the written authorisation of the director.  That is one anomaly I see in the way amendment No. 66 has been drafted.  Perhaps I am missing something and the Minister will put me right.<\/p> <p>One will see that the following amendment has been designed to exclude all references to advisers and consultants on the basis that it is my strong opinion that we do not need consultants and advisers.  It seems that what is being planned but never admitted openly is that much of the work of the commission will be farmed out to recruitment advisers in interviewing and short-listing people.  They will perform a winnowing out of supposedly unacceptable people and produce smaller lists for consideration by the commission.

He proposes to make it an offence for which a person will be liable \"on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both\".  I want to make this clear.  That is a useless proposal.  When I was Attorney General, there was a good deal of upset, particularly on the part of my predecessor, Mr. David Byrne, when a Garda file purporting to identify people who had unlawful abortions in Ireland was revealed to a newspaper.  The result was that when the Garda file was given to the newspaper, reporters from that newspaper presented themselves at the doors of various women mentioned in it.  This caused absolute outrage among the people who were mentioned in this way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#CC01700","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Of course it did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#CC01800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The result was that the then Attorney General, David Byrne, asked the Garda Commissioner to use all of his powers to identify the source of the leak and prevent this kind of thing from happening.  The Garda Commissioner at the time was Mr. Patrick Byrne.  He attempted to comply with the Attorney General's request and found himself being effectively stonewalled, with people refusing to make any statements to the investigating garda&iacute;.  At the end of this futile investigation in which he could find out nothing, he informed the Attorney General's office that unless and until a power of arrest and questioning was conferred on him, he could do nothing to investigate the unauthorised leaking of sensitive Garda information of that kind.<\/p> <p>That led, when I was the Minister's predecessor, to the insertion of an indictable offence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 so that where leaking of sensitive information took place unlawfully, there was a power for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to arrest persons suspected of leaking or inciting other people to do so and the power of detention for questioning under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.<\/p> <p>In effect, the Garda Commissioner was saying was that the Official Secrets Act 1963 was no help to him because of the penalties involved.  In the circumstances, therefore, he needed to have investigatory powers.  If leaking confidential information is to be an offence, it must the case that if a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na knocks on the door of a journalist or whoever else and asks how that person seems to have published leaked minutes of a certain body, he or she is not in a position to simply say the Garda must talk to their solicitor and bid them good night.  That is the position if it is a summary offence of this kind.  If the Minister wishes to make it an offence and give its enforcement teeth, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be given the right to investigate where egregious breaches of confidentiality take place.  <\/p> <p>I have no doubt the Minister will be tempted, and perhaps prompted, to say that this is a very black scenario, that he hopes this never happens and that I am conjuring up an unlikely scenario.  I do not accept that proposition.  People will be expected to apply to this commission in confidence, knowing the information concerning their application and, even more seriously, their assessment will be handled.  Can Members imagine if the assessment of a professional person or a judge were to be leaked to a newspaper?  Whether the assessment was carried out by a consultant or the commission itself, imagine the discrediting damage not merely to the person involved and to the commission, but also to the Judiciary itself.<\/p> <p>Either we are serious about keeping some level of confidentiality in this matter or we are not.  I refer to material such as the marking of assessments, the results of an interview process or pre-screening carried out by a consultant or advisory group.  Either we are serious about preventing that from appearing on the front page of a newspaper or we are not.  I have no problem with making such leaking a criminal offence, because purely civil duties of confidentiality do not inhibit journalists from printing material.  They do not inhibit people from leaking material unless they can be identified as the source by their employer, by one means or another.  A member of the commission may be stupid enough to leak information to a third party, even in good faith.  If any of that information gets on the front page of a newspaper, it will be deeply damaging to the people who are being assessed, to the commission itself and to public confidence in the Judiciary.  I shudder to think what the result would be if a Circuit Court judge who applied for appointment to the High Court were to find that his or her assessment was on the front of a newspaper.  <\/p> <p>I believe that leaking such information would have to be made a criminal offence.  The JAAB does not leave a trail of that kind.  When I was there, it never had minutes that could be leaked.  The worst secret that could be revealed about somebody is that they applied to JAAB, because there would not be a record of any kind beyond that.  In the new world which has been conjured up for us in this legislation, there will be formal interviews, ranking of applicants and a pre-interview process of winnowing out unsuitable people.  Presumably these will be documented, stating the reasons why Joe or Josephine Soap never even made it to an interview process.  If happens there will have to be a documentary trail.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->All of that is going to happen, so there will have to be a documentary trail.  If there is a documentary trail, it might have consequences for sitting judges and others.  Take, for example, a solicitor in practice in rural Ireland.  If it was revealed that there was a document somewhere created by this commission or its advisers or consultants saying that, in the view of a particular person, the person was wholly unsuitable to be a judge for one reason or another, it would have a serious affect on that person.  There will be a chilling effect if the protections against breach of confidentiality are not observed.  Whether or not the Minister is attracted to the substance of subsection 2 of my proposed section 28 in amendment No. 70, one has to have the five year term in order to make it possible for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring to book those who breach the obligation of confidentiality.  <\/p><p>To return to the point I made about former Attorney General David Byrne and me when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it was the appreciation of the effect on ordinary people's lives of the absence of an effective remedy to stop the leaking of Garda files to members of the press due to salacious material contained in them that led to the amendment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  <\/p><p>On amendment No. 69 proposed by the Minister, I have the strongest possible objection to it becoming a summary offence.  If it is to be an offence, it has to be an indictable offence for the purpose of making it properly investigable by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If it is not an indictable offence, a person can simply get his or her solicitor to write to the local sergeant to say that he or she will not be available for interview on this subject and does not propose to say anything about it, even if he or she is the prime suspect for the leak.  The same applies to a journalist who publishes it.  The journalist will be able to say that he or she has nothing to say and does not want to participate in any interviews with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He or she would be able to just walk away from it, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have to prove that a particular person was the person who leaked the document by some extraneous means.  To return to the case I mentioned of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na files identifying alleged victims of backstreet abortions in Dublin which led to reporters appearing on their doorstep, it proved so damaging to those people, but the Commissioner was effectively powerless to deal with it because the offence was a summary offence which did not carry a five-year term of imprisonment.  Perhaps it was statutory as well, but it carried a two-year term.  Under the Official Secrets Act, the garda in question was effectively immune from arrest or interrogation in respect of the action, as was the journalist.  <\/p><p>I strongly advise the Minister that the remedy has to be effective.  If it is not, because of the complexity and the documentary nature of the procedures this commission is supposed to undertake, the effect of breaches of confidentiality could be enormous.  The Minister may well say that this contrasts with my willingness to have the Attorney General tell the Cabinet that a particular applicant was unsuccessful.  My answer to that, if that point is made, is simply that the Government is entitled to know who wants to be appointed.  I have never heard, in all of my time as a barrister, Attorney General, Minister, Deputy and Senator, of a breach of confidentiality coming from Government of a type which is damaging to a lawyer.  I have never heard that happen.  Members of the Government, as very senior constitutional office holders, would understand the absolute importance of confidentiality in such circumstances, while at the same time believing that it is totally right to know who was seeking the job, including those who were not shortlisted.  Under the present Judicial Appointments Advisory Board procedures, which are very informal, I have never come across a newspaper, television or radio report indicating that a person applied and was not recommended for the job, even though that information is available to the Minister and the Government under the present system.  There is no paper trail.  It is one person's word against another's, and it is not the kind of thing a journalist would publish, even if he or she got news of it over a pint in a pub.  The journalist would not dare to publish it because he or she would not know if it was true or untrue and would not know what the situation was, unless he or she heard it from a disappointed applicant.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister to deal with the textual problem I raised, and also the seeming illogicality in amendment No. 66, whereby members of staff do not have to have the consent of the commission in writing whereas the director does.  I cannot follow how that would work.  Real problems will arise if this is backed up solely by a summary conviction and penalty.  It will mean any breaches of this criminal law will be impossible to investigate unless the person doing the leaking is foolish enough to volunteer a confession to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, even though he or she is not capable of being arrested or questioned about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#CC01900","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I will make three points in response to Senator McDowell.

That is set out in the Fines Act 2010 and it can be varied by the Oireachtas, should it be deemed necessary.  As Senators are aware, the categories of fine are classed A to E.  The highest value of fine is class A at &euro;5,000.<\/p> <p>It is a question of balance and of ensuring that there is criminal sanction.  It was in response to Senator McDowell that I was very keen to ensure that there is a criminal sanction regime in respect of the unauthorised or unlawful disclosure of information.  It is important not only to be proportionate but also to be consistent.  On the matter of consistency, I point to the approach under section 62, the lesser offence, for example, of canvassing - of making contact with a Senator in order for a favour to be proffered in respect of a particular issue.  A person convicted under that section is liable to a class A fine and the question of imprisonment would not apply.<\/p> <p>I have given the matter consideration.  I have heard Senator McDowell speak on this issue before.  I have reflected, but I share the advice given to me to the effect that a summary offence is sufficient and is appropriate for dealing with the breaches of the non-disclosure principles in sections 27 and 28, as amended.  I take very seriously the points Senator McDowell makes and the analogies he draws.  However, despite his exhortations, I am not convinced that the argument in respect of making such offences punishable by a term of imprisonment on indictment is compelling.<\/p> <p>In the context of consistency, I examined other legislation.  Section 15 of the Property Services Regulation Act makes it an offence punishable by a class A fine only for disclosed confidential information expressed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority.

To return to the issue of confidentiality, I am not satisfied that confidentiality is covered under the current wording.  I am not sure there is anything in it that would deter an individual from the engaging in the old \"d&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i\" type of thing.  We could have friendly chats in corridors or two people out having a drink and one telling the other that Murphy was put forward and that he should have heard what the committee had to say about him.  The next thing we know some up and coming senior counsel's career has been destroyed.  I am not satisfied in that regard.<\/p> <p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Norris, about the deletion of the line, \"unless he or she is duly authorised by the Commission to so do\".  That little bit of flexibility needs to be provided.<\/p> <p>The most important point I can make on this particular section is that I believe it makes the Bill unconstitutional.  Senator McDowell has made this point on a number of occasions.  The Attorney General, the adviser to the Government, will sit on this committee.   The Government will be presented with three candidates as a result of the deliberations and the Attorney General may find himself or herself totally opposed to the appointment of any of the three.  The Government may find itself opposed to the appointment of any of the three and may ask the Attorney General whether another person may have been better suited to the position.  Is the Attorney General, who has a constitutional role as adviser to the Government, to say he or she is awful sorry, that he or she knows of somebody but cannot open his or her mouth because he or she is bound by the legislation?  I am extremely concerned.  If I were a member of the Bar and had my eyes on the Bench, the first thing I would do following the passage of the Bill would be to challenge it under the Constitution because it could destroy my career prospects.  That is without even referring to the role of consultants in the matter.<\/p> <p>While I fully understand the Minister's view of how this Bill will work, with all due respect, he will establish an independent committee and once that independence is in place, it will be up to that committee to decide whether to appoint a group of consultants, whoever those consultants may be.  I have some difficulty with appointing judges using consultants from the accountancy profession or some other profession.  Who will draw up the shortlist in the scenario presented by Senator McDowell where there are 120 applicants?  Will some 25 year old graduate who has just finished a business and law degree in one of our esteemed universities sit down, check boxes and decide which 15 applicants should go forward for interview?  I am very concerned about this matter.  Once this committee is in place, the Minister cannot tell it how to do its business.  He cannot preclude it from using consultants or tell its members he expects them not to use consultants.  At the end of the day, it can use as many consultants as it wishes.  I am concerned about the constitutionality of these provisions.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the Minister's patience and that he is being run around the same issues time and again.  Surely that must ring alarm bells for him at this stage.  I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#GG01700","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I want to correct a false impression which the Minister has created.

Senator Craughwell was absolutely on the button with one point.  We have declared that the commission is to be independent in discharging its functions.  What the Minister or his successors might think it would be preferable for them to do is not really relevant to this; it is what they can do that is relevant.  I ask Members to look back to a section we have already debated, section 11(7) and (8).  Section 11(7) says the commission, as it considers necessary, not as anybody else considers necessary-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#GG02400","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>It says \"may\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#HH00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Yes.  The wording is:<\/p><blockquote>The Commission may as it considers necessary to assist it in the performance of its functions &mdash;(a) enter into contracts or arrangements with any person, and<br \/><br \/>(b) with the consent of the Minister, appoint consultants or advisers.<\/blockquote> <p>There is a distinction here between &ldquo;any person&rdquo; and appointed consultants and advisers.  I ask the House to remember that.  Then section 11(8) states:<\/p><blockquote>Any contract or arrangement with a person, or appointment of a consultant or adviser, referred to in <i>subsection (7) <\/i>may enable the person, consultant or adviser to&mdash;(a) advise and assist the Commission in its consideration of applicants at a preliminary stage in the course of the selection procedures, and<br \/><br \/>(b) provide an evaluation or an assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s suitability for appointment that would assist the Commission in making any decision in the course of carrying out those procedures,but shall not enable the person, consultant or adviser, for the purpose of performance by the Commission of that function, to do any other thing (other than a thing which facilitates such performance).<\/blockquote> <p>We discussed the ludicrous unintelligibility of that provision before.  It is very clear from the last paragraph of section 11(8) that the sole purpose for which persons, consultants and advisers can be appointed is to advise the commission in its consideration of applicants at a preliminary stage, which I described as the winnowing out stage, and then to provide an evaluation or assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s suitability for appointment that would assist the commission.  That is in the Minister&rsquo;s Bill; I am not conjuring it up.  That is the function of the three categories.<\/p><p>In respect of the category of &quot;a person&quot;, I do not know what sort of person they might appoint who was not a consultant or an adviser.  However, they could ask a &quot;person&quot; to look at all the applications for such a position, first of all to winnow out under section 11(8)(a) the people who are at a preliminary stage and are not even to be considered, and then under section 11(8)(b) to do a further and much more serious thing, which is to carry out an evaluation of an applicant.  That is what the law is providing.  None of this is in the JAAB procedure, by the way.  It has never, ever attempted to do anything like this and it would be foolish of it ever to contemplate doing this kind of thing.  I should point out because it is relevant that in section 11(7)(b), the Minister alone is entitled, by withholding consent, to prevent the appointment of consultants and advisers, but he is not able to stop a &quot;person&quot; under section 11(7)(a) from being appointed by the commission to carry out these functions.  He has no veto power there. <\/p><p>We are dealing with the capacity of the commission to appoint a person by way of contract to carry out a winnowing function and then, among those who have survived the winnowing, to carry out an evaluation of applicants.  That is what the legislation is about.  I do not want to waste the time of the House just going back over this.  It is wrong-headed and should not be there.  If this commission is going to be so elaborate and so great as the Minister, Deputy Ross, has claimed, and so well resourced, why would it want to appoint persons to evaluate the suitability of applicants?  The Minister has said here that he thinks I have the wrong end of the stick.  I am saying these are the provisions he is giving this independent commission, which, as Senator Craughwell said, he has the right to do.<\/p><p>How does this tie in to section 27?  The evaluations, presumably, will be in writing.  Presumably, they will contain confidential information.  If it is the case that members of the Judiciary seeking promotion or members of the legal profession seeking to be appointed as judges in the first instance are to be subject to a process whereby a person not even on the commission evaluates their suitability, then breach of the obligation of confidentiality could be catastrophic for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#HH00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":481,"content":"<p>If they are no use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#HH00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":482,"content":"<p>It could be catastrophic if the expert appointed by the commission decided that a particular judge was not suitable for promotion or that a barrister or solicitor was unsuitable.

He must provide for the power to detain the person who leaks that information and put him or her through the ordinary process of questioning for a serious offence under the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  In the absence of such a power, this confidentiality obligation is more or less worthless.  The Minister suggested that I should compare this provision with the punishment of the disclosure of confidential information under the property registration system.  Perhaps there are terrible secrets in the Four Courts relating to who owns a certain property, who enjoys a right of way over a property or who applied for a right of way over a property.  Maybe there is confidential information in what used to be the registry of deeds and processes in the land registry and is now part of the Property Registration Authority.  Maybe there is some terrible secret down there, but I cannot imagine it, whereas I do not need an imagination to see that an evaluation of the suitability of a professional person or a sitting judge must of its very essence remain confidential, especially when it is carried out by a person who is not even a member of the commission.  I remind the House that such a person will be appointed under contract with or without the consent of the Minister because the Minister will not choose these people.  He will have no say in who the person is because the commission is independent.<\/p> <p>The Minister has shied away from the point that has been picked up on by Senators Norris and Craughwell, which is that we are talking about the power to carry out a proper investigation.  I suggest that providing for a summary offence, rather than the power to carry out a proper investigation, is parking ticket stuff in terms of the consequences for those involved.  If they are in any way intelligent - most of the people involved in this whole process will be intelligent - they will realise that they are free to tell the Garda to get lost because they have nothing to say and do not propose to be interviewed on foot of the Garda's suspicions on the matter.  This will mean that the door is slammed in the face of any proper investigation.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the circumstances I have detailed and the point I have made.  The confidential information provision needs to be taken seriously.  When I said on Second Stage that I was worried about this aspect of the legislation, the Minister kindly told the House he would do something on this front.  However, the proposal he has introduced is simply not adequate.  There is no point in coming up with a non-solution to the question of investigability dressed up as a half-solution to it.  Breaches of this kind are investigable or they are not.  My experience, based on the incident I mentioned earlier, is that the impact of this provision will be limited in the absence of a power of arrest.  That was the view of the then Garda Commissioner.  He found that doors were slammed in his face.  He had to accept that people did not want to be investigated and did not want the investigation to go further.  That is the evil we are dealing with here.  I strongly urge the Minister to face up to that fact.  He should accept that his amendment is not acceptable in its present form.  It is not up to the job.  It does not add very much to the Bill because it can be ignored with impunity.  That is the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018110800002#JJ00300","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1541673000,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on what Senator McDowell has just said.  I have made the point that a negative comment about a distinguished barrister from a consultant involved in the selection of a judge or a member of the committee could cause the loss of that barrister's career.  It could destroy his or her career.  It had not crossed my mind until just now that something negative could arise during the evaluation of a member of the Judiciary who has applied for promotion and find its way into the public domain.  In such circumstances, the judge's career would be over.  If we look at this from the perspective of the preservation of public money, we will appreciate that such a judge would not walk away quietly.  Negative commentary along the lines of, \"We appointed the barrister Murphy rather than the judge O'Connor because Murphy was A, B and C and you would want to hear what they had to say about O'Connor\", would destroy the unique position the Judiciary has held in this country.  I would be the first person to admit I have not always agreed with the sentences handed down by judges or the actions of judges in various cases.  I am a layman looking on.  Like most people, I judge these matters on the basis of my views or the views of people like me.  I am not a member of the Judiciary.  As Senator McDowell was speaking, it struck me that when a distinguished judge is looking for promotion, a consultant might discover some box that could not be ticked.  The name of such a judge could become known if we fail to provide for strong legislation with respect to indicting and allowing the Garda to investigate.  The further we go into this Bill, the more dangerous it becomes.  I am concerned that the system we will use to appoint judges is dangerous and the consequences being opened up when confidentiality clauses break down are dangerous.  Are we trying to push this Bill through to tick a box and say that is that?  Are we seeking to pass the Bill to get it out of the way?  Are we prepared to live with the consequences of such an approach?  This Bill will outlive the Minister, me and many people who will come after us.  We need to make sure we get it right.

This has happened in the past.  We know this is the historical reality.  The case in question could not be prosecuted because it was only a summary offence.  Senator McDowell has indicated clearly that he is not confining the matter to an indictable offence.  He is very clearly leaving open the question of a summary approach to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which will decide on the appropriate course to take.

It is important that we be consistent, but I will examine it.  This was a major point made by Senator McDowell on Second Stage and I said I would examine it in discussions with officials and in reference to the Attorney General   The Senators are still not satisfied but I will examine it to see if we can move matters closer towards a meeting of minds.  However, I will not go back over section 11 because it does not serve our time well here.  These decisions have been taken by the Seanad.<\/p> <p>Finally, regarding the point made again by Senator Norris, amendment No. 66 covers any person who is privy to confidential information.  This is catered for under section 27.  The reference to \"director only\" in amendment No. 66 simply reflects the fact that it is only the director, not another member of the staff, who could be delegated the function of consenting to a disclosure, that being considered either appropriate or necessary.  I ask the Senators to move on, particularly in view of what I have said in respect of the sanctions.

In this case, however, it is not necessary to have a fertile imagination to see that disclosure of this type of material almost certainly would have serious adverse consequences for people.  My point, which I made on Second Stage and which the amendment is designed to address, is that if there is no workable sanction it is simply window dressing to provide for a summary offence because people can ignore the law and tell garda&iacute; to get lost and get out of the house and that they have nothing further to say to them.  If there is no adequate sanction for this, it will affect the frequency of offences.  If there is a substantial penalty and a substantial likelihood that if one commits a serious offence here one will be arrested and questioned in a Garda station, one will think a great deal longer than if one thought it was only a matter of politely telling a garda that one has nothing further to say and one wants to go back in to finish one's meal.
