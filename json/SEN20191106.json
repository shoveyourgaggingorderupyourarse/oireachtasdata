However, not one school place is available for any child in the Dublin 12-Crumlin area.  I have brought up this issue on numerous occasions with the Minister who has been kind enough to listen.  Today I would like a positive response from him to allow the children to be part of their community and not to have to travel miles, if they are lucky enough to find places.<\/p><p>I will bring the Minister through the responses I have received on the facilities available in surrounding areas to which one is told to apply.  The nearest such facility is in Walkinstown; the rest are out of reach in other areas.  Regardless, every single one of them is full.  I meet parents who are tearing their hair out in trying to secure early intervention for their children and then there are the post-primary schools, every single one of which is full, while the waiting lists are phenomenal.  As I said, Crumlin has a vibrant community.  The children who need extra care want to be part of that community, to grow up and be leaders in it, to have their family and friends around them and to build very strong bonds.  That is what we do when we go to school in our local area, which is the best solution for all of us.<\/p><p>On the home tuition that is available, I brought up this issue in a Commencement debate in April and May and at the beginning of July.  There are just no places available.  Parents in Dublin 12 set up a support group, with which I have been involved from the start.  They are tenacious, have knocked on every single door and will not take \"No\" for an answer.  They are still going to and have had conversations - some good, some not so good - with the NCSE which seems to be a little more positive and willing in its responses and aware of the need, as I know the Minister is.  Places were provided in the Dublin 15 area, but Dublin 12 is such a vibrant and densely populated area with absolutely nothing to show when it comes to the children of the area.  I have tried to obtain the relevant figures from the HSE, but it does not compile figures for the numbers diagnosed with autism in a given area.  Such figures are difficult to get.  Perhaps the data might come through soon when services are up and running in order that they can be merged.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister has a positive response.  The parents in the area are fantastic.  They are just ordinary mammies and daddies who are looking out for their children and others who fall through the cracks.  They have great community spirit and staged numerous protests.  They have located a site and talked to the Department on several occasions.  It is an absolutely perfect site, a shut-down school that is mostly lying empty.  It would be a centre of excellence for children with extra needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#A00500","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht na nithe t&aacute;bhachtacha agus iontach suntasacha seo f&aacute; choinne seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; daoine &oacute;ga a ard&uacute;.  I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  <\/p> <p>The provision of education for children with special needs is an ongoing priority for the Government.  Currently, almost 20%, or &euro;1 out of every &euro;5, of the total Vote, or &euro;1.9 billion, is invested in supporting children with special needs.  The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and special needs assistants are at unprecedented levels.  Nationally, 167 new special classes opened for the 2019-20 school year, which means that there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011.  Of these, 1,353 special classes cater for students diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  The majority of children with autism attend mainstream classes, in which they may access additional supports, if required.  However, as some students may find it difficult to manage a full-time placement in mainstream classes, placement in a special class or special school setting may be deemed to be appropriate where placement in a mainstream class is not in the child's best interests.<\/p> <p>The National Council for Special Education has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services for children with special educational needs in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive.  The council has well established structures in place to plan and co-ordinate special education provision throughout the country.  It includes identifying the need for and establishing special class placements in various geographical areas where they are required.  The council ensures schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  Normally, special classes are established with the full co-operation of the schools in areas where they are required.  There are, however, some parts of the country where the council has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to agree voluntarily to provide special class or school places.  I know that this can cause much anguish for the parents and families involved.<\/p> <p>As Minister, I have a power under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to make additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation was used for the first time in April this year in the Dublin 15 area.  We have made significant progress in a relatively short period, with the opening of seven new special classes and a new special school which will provide 88 places for children with special needs.  The new places will help the families and children concerned to have access to education.  I wish everyone well on that journey.  The legislation contains a procedure under which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and under which, ultimately, a ministerial direction may be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision.  The initial steps in this procedure are being progressed.  As Minister, I am prepared to use the legislation when necessary to ensure children can access a suitable education.  My preference, however, is for schools to engage with this challenge voluntarily because it is the right thing for the children in their communities.  The experience in Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed in opening new special classes and how we can resolve these challenges by working together and in partnership.  To that end, the NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across south Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream.<\/p> <p>To respond to the issue the Senator raised in Dublin 12, I have asked my officials this morning to consider, in collaboration with the NCSE, what is the best solution, the best fit.  A combination of solutions is on offer, be it a mainstream class or an additional class.  <\/p> <p>The Senator also raised the issue of the use of a specific building as a potential centre of excellence.  We will look at all options to see what is the best fit, obviously in conjunction and consultation with the parents.  The difficulty in finding the best fit is that it must be met by resources, which is a challenge.  Next September, there will be 17,000 SNAs on stream.  We have opened additional classes across the country, including in Dublin and Cork city, where there are major pressures.  Ultimately, although we continue to highlight what we are doing, it may not pacify the anguish or meet the needs of parents who cannot get their son or daughter into a school.  I want to continue to work in a collaborative way.  I know that the various teacher representative bodies are also very engaged in this process.  Some schools will not enter into a partnership or open new classes on the basis that there is a fear that there will not be adequate training or resources or the proper capacity to do so.  I am also very conscious of this.  However, I reassure the Senator that, regarding the area to which she referred, we will give proper attention to the detail of what is required to see what is the best fit, the best solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#B00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am trying desperately to read between the lines of the Minister's response, but I absolutely acknowledge his Trojan efforts in finding more places for children with ASD.

We have to be very pragmatic when it comes to long-term planning because it will not happen today or tomorrow but we have a new school pilot involving up to 75 schools in west Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare, where we need the all-inclusive model.  The new school inclusion, and the ideal model, is where we have speech and language therapists, behavioural therapists, occupational therapists, and teachers in that same environment, rather than putting the pressure on parents to get a diagnosis at a cost and putting that additional strain on parents to look for referrals to the HSE, where the HSE may not be working in conjunction with the schools.  We need that all-inclusive model.  That is the long-term plan.  By long term, I mean that the pilot will be finished in June of this year and we will be getting learnings from that.  We have to ensure that we have an opportunity, a platform and an environment for every single student, regardless of ability or label, and ultimately focused on the learning potential.

I thank the Minister, Deputy McHugh, for coming in to deal with this important Commencement matter.  I am from Ennistymon in County Clare, a town that has three schools which are doing their best in primitive buildings to provide quality education facilities and supports to more than 600 students.  The Department has made a commitment and the money is in place to build a new purpose-built state-of-the-art community school.  Much work has been done by the boards of management, the parents and the Government to get this project to the stage it is at.<\/p> <p>My purpose in raising this issue today is to find out exactly where this project is at.  The design team has advised that it sent a list of suitable contractors to the Department and did a pre-submission a number of months ago.  It has also submitted a report outlining the necessary steps to ensure the school will have a near zero carbon position, which is all very welcome.  As a result of this type of development, an economic analysis study has to be carried out.  Has this short-list been approved?  Has whatever necessary economic assessment been carried out and what is the timeline for the school at the moment?  When will this project go out to tender?  How long will the tender process take and when can we expect construction to begin on the site?<\/p> <p>This project is ongoing for a long time now.  There was talk of a community school in Ennistymon when I was in school, and I left in 1993.  Discussions were taking place the entire time I was in school.  I, along with others, have worked hard on this project.  The fact the money was committed in 2015 and we are now in 2019 and construction has not started is a little frustrating for parents and students.  Parents are very patient and understanding.  They know that it will happen and would prefer it be done right than rushed.  However, the fact it has gone on and on, people have started to wonder if it will ever happen.  I know that it will but we need clear timelines as to when the project will go out to full tender, if that has not already happened, and when can we expect construction to begin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#C00700","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will try to comply with the rules and regulations and will try to be as brief as possible.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position in relation to the major building project for Ennistymon in County Clare.  This major project will deliver a new post-primary school to cater for 650 pupils and a new primary school on a shared site.  The project is currently in stage 2b - detailed design of architectural planning - which includes statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.  Planning permission, fire certificate and disability access certificate have all been secured for this project. <\/p> <p>All Government Departments, local authorities, the Health Service Executive, public bodies and all bodies in receipt of public funding must comply, as appropriate, with the relevant requirements of the public spending code.  The public spending code is the set of rules and procedures that apply to ensure that these standards are upheld across the Irish public service.  The code brings together in one place all the elements of the value-for-money framework that has been in force up to now.<\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills, similar to all Irish public bodies, is obliged to treat public funds with care, and to ensure that the best possible value-for-money is obtained whenever public money is being spent or invested.  An economic appraisal must be conducted for all capital projects costing in excess of &euro;20 million and should be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to the sanctioning authority granting the approval in principle.<\/p> <p>In the case of the school project for Ennistymon, a procurement process was carried out in early April 2019 to commission a specialist company to carry out a cost-benefit analysis.  A number of responses were received and a successful tender was awarded and instructed to proceed on 30 April.  A draft document was received in July but some data was still outstanding.  My Department requested the project manager to collaborate and assist the company in obtaining the relevant data from the schools.  The completed draft document was reviewed by Department officials in September and feedback has issued back to the authors.  It is expected that the final report will be made available to the Department within four weeks.<\/p> <p>The design team has carried out a pre-qualification process to produce a short-list of building contractors and a separate list of mechanical and electrical contractors.  The Department is continuing to liaise with the project manager in this regard.<\/p> <p>When all items have been satisfactorily completed, the Department expects to be in a position to authorise the project to progress to tender stage which normally takes between seven and eight months to complete.  This does not necessarily mean that it cannot be done in less time.  I can confirm to Senator Conway that this project is included in the Department of Education and Skills construction programme which is being delivered under the national development plan.<\/p> <p>One of the things we are all very conscious of is ensuring that people's expectations are met and that there is no weakness as to the advancement of this project.  It is committed to and is in the capital plan.  There is money available for this project.  I will ensure, through the Senator's contacts, that we keep this on a live footing to ensure we get movement on it.  To reiterate, we are waiting on the first stage within the next four weeks, when we will be looking at feedback on the submissions that have been made.  Once we have all that documentation together, we will move to the tender process, which is the most important process of all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#C00800","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for renewing the Government's commitment to delivering this school as it is very important that it happen.

I know that he had to reschedule other business to be here, which I appreciate.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, the local improvement scheme is particularly important for rural communities.  It supports improvement works on laneways and non-public roads which are vital in the functioning of everyday life in rural Ireland.  The scheme is very popular and essential and greatly appreciated by those who use the roads in question.  Improvement works on laneways and non-public roads are very important for local communities.  Such roads often lead to houses and farms, but also, importantly, they lead to lakes, rivers, beaches, castles and other important cultural sites.<\/p> <p>In County Cavan there is a ten-year backlog of applications owing to a lack of funding.  There is a similar issue in many other counties, with an eight-year backlog in County Monaghan.  A total number of 800 applications have been made in County Wexford, of which only 30 have been funded to date.  I would like to see a substantial increase in the funding provided for this important scheme in 2020.  The scheme is highly valuable and represents a great investment in rural communities.  It is important that this rural infrastructure be protected and receive investment in order that families can live along laneways that are drivable and up to a decent standard. <\/p> <p>The scheme is administered by the local authorities which identify roads to be included in the scheme each year.  As people who represent rural constituencies, the Minister of State and I are conscious of how important the scheme has been during the years.  I am keen to see more money invested to try to reduce the substantial backlog of applications in many counties.  Unfortunately, funding for the scheme through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was stopped in 2012, prior to which it was a mainstream scheme within the overall roadworks programme funded directly by the Department.  Alongside that funding, there was a top-up payment for projects in rural areas under the CL&Aacute;R programme of the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It is time this form of funding mechanism and the status of the local improvement scheme were restored and a serious effort was made to reduce substantially the big backlog of applications in most counties.<\/p> <p>The funding allocated to counties Cavan and Monaghan in recent years has been fully drawn down and the work carried out to a very high standard.  It is important that the scheme not be put beyond people's reach because of income pressures.  In many instances, family members, often sons or daughters, might want to set up home on a site given to them by their parents.  One of the factors taken into consideration in deciding whether to build in a location is the quality of the roadway to the proposed home and the quality of the road network more generally.  In many communities there is good quality community infrastructure such as football and hurling clubs, soccer clubs and community centres, with a great network of primary schools, by and large.  During the years the local improvement scheme has been of huge importance to families living in rural communities and needs to be funded adequately to bring laneways and non-public roads up to a proper standard.

The local improvement scheme, or the LIS as it is affectionately known, is a programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas.  The scheme is funded by my Department and administered through the local authorities.  There was no dedicated funding for the scheme for a number of years owing to constraints on public expenditure.  However, I was very conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country and it was reinstated in 2017.  The Department has since allocated over &euro;48 million to local authorities for LIS roads across the country, including &euro;10 million earlier this year.  Since 2017 over 1,600 projects have been completed with this funding.  The LIS is clearly very popular and I know that it is greatly appreciated by the people who use the roads in question on a daily basis.  The works carried out not only improve access for the people who live on these roads but they also improve access for service providers, including the emergency services.  Projects prioritised by the local authority can also lead to important community amenities such as graveyards, beaches, piers and heritage sites.<\/p> <p>It is clear that there is a continuing demand for LIS funding in rural communities across Ireland.  I am pleased that we have again secured &euro;10 million for the scheme in 2020.  However, I also want to review the scheme to ensure it is operating as effectively as possible for those who use the roads in question on a daily basis.  There are wide variations in the cost of completing works across local authorities.  I am also concerned by the pace at which the local authorities are completing works.  Of the &euro;10 million allocated to local authorities under the LIS this year, only &euro;3.4 million has been paid out to date in the completion of works.<\/p> <p>We are committed to continuing to support rural communities in 2020 under the LIS and the Minister intends to announce a new round of funding next year.  However, I also want to ensure we are getting the best value for money in funding the scheme and for the people who live and work along these roads who have to make a contribution towards the cost.

I represent Limerick city, where the number of apartments being granted planning permission is causing concern among my constituents.  What plans does the Minister have to reduce the density guidelines for homes developed outside of Dublin and city centres?  Under the 2009 urban guidelines, density levels are between 35 and 50 units per hectare, which results in a large number of apartments in any development.  The most recent CSO figures, for quarter 2, show that the number of apartments is now at approximately the same level as that of houses.  In quarter 2, some 4,900 applications for houses were approved and 4,700 for apartments, which is an increase of 156% in the number of apartment applications in the past year while the number of housing applications remains more or less static.  Will a review be carried out?  We want sustainable living.<\/p> <p>I speak in particular about where I live, in Castletroy, where it has become an important issue, given the large number of planning applications being submitted.  Many apartments, even if they are built, will not be sold and, consequently, many developers do not build them.  The cost of developing apartments is approximately 30% higher per unit than that of building a house, whether semi-detached or terraced.  Furthermore, many developers cannot secure funding to build apartment blocks and, in many cases, they forward sell them.  Such apartments are not starter homes.<\/p> <p>While I do not wish to discuss the specifics of planning permission, given that it is a confidential matter, I will outline an example.  In Castletroy, there is a development of 332 units, comprising 53 detached houses, 157 semi-detached houses, 91 terraced townhouses, and 32 apartments in a three-storey block.  It constitutes a density level of approximately 30 units per hectare.  The development is beside a public park and works exceptionally well.  The type of living is sustainable and of mixed use.  We need to build homes but they need to be starter homes.  A number of developments have been initiated nearby, some of which are awaiting a decision while planning permission has been granted for others.  The local authority seeks 41 units per hectare.  In some cases, where there would have been terraced houses, the local authority has sought increased density by adding apartments but that is not sustainable.<\/p> <p>The area of Castletroy is highly populated and, while there is public transport, it needs to be enhanced.  There are capacity issues with the level of development as it is.  The development in question is highly sustainable, with more than 30 units per hectare, and combines an apartment block, terraced houses, semi-detached houses and some detached houses.  By increasing the density requirements from 35 units to 50 per hectare, however, the only development that will be able to get planning permission is an apartment block.  That is borne out in the CSO figures, which show that the number of apartments is now similar to that of housing.  The number of housing applications granted permission has been static for the past year but it needs to be revisited.  High-density buildings are needed in the centre of Limerick, Dublin and other cities.  Outside of the city centres, in the suburban areas, account must be taken of what is sustainable.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to carry out a review of Dublin city and all the other cities.  He might take the examples I have given and perhaps the matter can be examined by him and his officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#E00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>It is my first opportunity to speak in the Chamber since it has been refurbished and it is fantastic to be back.

It is not just about increasing the supply of any type of home being built but rather about building the right types of homes, for the right people, in the right places.  With Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, we have tried to make decisions at a national level as to what that means.  We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past and to condemn future generations to urban sprawl.  It is bad for the climate to build further and further away from jobs, schools and hospitals.  It will also condemn people to long commutes to the city centre, work and school if we are not able to build more homes closer to the viable infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The big question is what the ideal density is.  We produce national guidelines and each of the local authorities' development plan should be in line with them.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la retains the powers to challenge a local plan if it is not in line with national policy.  Since the beginning of this year, for the first time ever, there is a national planning regulator.  If someone believes that what the local authority is doing in a given area is incorrect, he or she can now appeal to the planning regulator.  If someone believes that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has done something incorrectly, he or she can tell the planning regulator that he needs to examine the matter.

In urban areas, there should be a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare.  On how the Government can help drive greater density, some Land Development Agency sites in Dublin will reach 100 dwellings per hectare, which is quite an achievement.  That will involve many apartments, which are badly needed in the centre of Dublin.  The Senator referred to the increase in apartment building.  It is welcome, but we need to see far more.  It is not meant to replace the traditional building of houses.  We are meant to be doing both.  Outside inner city areas, there is a dwelling density of 35 to 50 per hectare or rugby pitch.  That is recognised as a good standard for urban areas, not the inner city core.  We are aiming for approximately 35 dwellings per hectare in larger towns and fewer than 35 dwellings per hectare in villages and other areas.  Those are our aims in terms of good density.<\/p><p>In trying to reach those density requirements, we need to break our thinking that every single home or dwelling on that ruby pitch must be a house.  On one site, we can have houses, apartments, duplexes and shared accommodation for the elderly with all the appropriate services such as live-in help and so on.  Some housing bodies have done that very effectively, with a particularly good example in County Kilkenny.  We are trying to give guidance to local authorities and private developers on a new way of thinking around achieving a density of, for example, 35 to 50 dwellings per hectare in an urban area.  Doing so does not mean building only apartments or houses and apartments; it can encompass three-bedroom, semi-detached houses, detached houses, terraced houses, apartments and step-down homes for the elderly on one site. <\/p><p>I have been to Castletroy several times, including once very recently.  The density of dwellings per hectare there seems appropriate, but I am happy to go to the site and take a look.  I will not interfere with planning permission or anything of the sort and I am not asking to meet the developer or the builder, but I will go the location referred to by the Senator.  I have done so in previous instances where people have told me that the densities set out under the guidelines do not work for a particular site.  It is incumbent on me to take a look and see whether their claims stack up.  I would like to do so in this instance, particularly because I know the area well, and see whether national policies make sense for that site.  I commit to doing so.<\/p><p>Home Building Finance Ireland has been operational since the beginning of the year and is helping smaller builders outside cities to secure finance to build homes.<\/p><p>On the viability of our housing stock, it is now more expensive to build homes because we are building them to an A standard.  Our social housing homes are the best homes being built in the country and that costs more money.  Apartments cost more because of the various things that must be done.  In order to increase viability we have made changes to some specifications such as the number of units per core and the need for car parking spaces.  Obviously, the latter is unnecessary in a place such as Dublin city centre but would be necessary in other parts of the country.  I recognise that it is a challenge.  When apartments were built many years ago in parts of Dublin such as Stepaside and other areas beyond the M50, people said that building apartments in such places was crazy because nobody would live in them.  Now there are not enough apartments in those areas because infrastructure such as public transport and so on was put in place.<\/p><p>It is important to remember that even in a crisis when people want homes built immediately, the homes we build should stand for 100 years.  We must ensure that we are building the right homes in the right places for the right types of people or else we will have more problems in the future.  I will visit the site in Castletroy such that I can get a proper understanding of the difficulties to which the Senator refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#E00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am sorry to have interrupted the Minister but I wanted to ensure the Senator has a chance to respond.

I look forward to welcoming him to Castletroy.  My perspective on this matter is straightforward: we need to increase density in city centres and we need to have a mix.  The problem is that it must be sustainable.  Many planning applications that are submitted involve a combination of apartments and terraced townhouses but the local authorities are pushing on density guidelines at national level and the planners are telling developers to increase density which, by definition, means more apartments.  That is reflected in the figures published by the Central Statistics Office, which has indicated that the number of apartments being granted permission is equivalent to the number of houses.  The  number of houses granted permission has not increased in the past year.  We need mixed developments with apartments, townhouses, semi-detached houses, detached houses and accommodation for older people.  The young families and parents whom I know want their children to be able to afford to buy and to have a choice.  The problem is that as density guidelines are so high, in many cases, many planning applications are comprised to a significant extent of apartment blocks that will never be built by the developers.  They will build some of the houses.  There is not enough housing stock coming on board and that is something at which we need to look.  We need to build more homes, but that must be done in a sustainable way.  I applaud the work being done by the Minister in terms of driving the number of houses being built, but it must be done in a sustainable way.<\/p> <p>I will welcome the Minister to Castletroy and show him the situation on the ground.  We can achieve a model that would reduce densities outside Dublin and inner cities while attaining an appropriate density level in a way that is sustainable in the long term in the areas concerned.  Local authorities should be given flexibility to make judgment calls regarding applications in specific areas in terms of the sustainability of housing.

This is the second highest figure ever recorded and is the highest one recorded in 2019.  It was unusual and horrific that the Government did not declare this an emergency.

I wish to speak first to the humanity of those working in organisations that provide practical and emotional support to those seeking asylum in this State, from the Irish Refugee Council to the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland.  I pay tribute to our primary and secondary schools across the country that are providing the gift of education and helping with the integration of refugees in the communities in which they reside.  Most of all, I pay tribute to the communities right across Ireland that host direct provision centres, from Killarney to Carrick-on-Suir, with little fuss and none of the fear that has been fostered in recent months.  These are the people and the Ireland I recognise.  It is not up to communities to identify who should or should not apply for asylum here or which application is more worthy than which.  That is the responsibility of the State.<\/p> <p>As Irish people, however, we are uniquely and indelibly linked to our own story of emigration, forced off these shores as we were through starvation and deprivation and granted asylum when no system existed to help build the most powerful nation on earth, the United States of America.  The ability of our State to meet the economic and social challenges of those seeking refuge is also unique among that of practically every other country in the European Union.  There are no rubber dinghies coming across the Irish Sea packed with people who carry with them the dreams and aspirations of a better life.  I accept that in the modern world every state must be able to control and manage its borders and that the management of those borders can at times be done with limited compassion.  Some people in this country want to undermine our democracy and are using the unsavoury tactic of blaming the other, or the stranger, for our economic and social injustices.  We Irish have seen this before, in signs stating \"no blacks, no dogs, no Irish\".  Our dialogue and discussions should be about how communities work to help those seeking asylum and whether we can talk about how Ireland fulfils its obligations to those seeking refuge.  Yes, let us have the honest discussion my colleague spoke about yesterday, but I plead for the discussion not to be about who should or should not apply in the first place or which person's application is more genuine than which.  Instead, the discussion should be about how we grant asylum as quickly as possible to those who are entitled to the refuge of this country.  How do we ensure that Ireland deals humanely with those who apply for asylum and those in our direct provision centres?  These are the questions that, if answered, will speak to the true instincts of us Irish people and our tied history to immigrant communities across the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#H00200","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I wish to pass on my condolences on the passing of Fr.

I know that money has been allocated, but not one single cent of it has so far gone to the people in Mayo or Donegal, I believe.  I really need the Minister to come before the House to clarify the criteria in that regard.<\/p> <p>I empathise with the 600,000 people in Dublin, Kildare and Meath who are facing a third day of the boil water notice.  I am perplexed, however, by the fact that the Government thinks it acceptable that people in Mayo and other rural areas live for years with boil water notices.  This year Mayo County Council sought funding for the construction of a number of new water schemes.  The Letterbrick scheme, in Kenagh, was one such scheme serving 24 connections, which would involve an extension to the Nephin valley group water scheme.  Another was the Downpatrick Head group water scheme.  The unfairness of funding still not being allocated to these group water schemes and the continuation of boil water notices for years and years must be addressed.  I, therefore, ask also that the Leader bring the Minister before the House to discuss group water schemes specifically.  I know that some allocations have been made, but we cannot go on for years and years with boil water notices.<\/p> <p>When will the Minister, Deputy Harris, release the valproate response report?  The report is on his desk.  Families have waited 18 months already for it.  We cannot get the information we need on the 1975 and 1983 licences.  I know that Karen Keely has been looking for this information.  She is a mother of three children who have been affected by valproate syndrome.  We need to get this sorted.  When will the report come off the Minister's desk and be published in order that a proper redress scheme, similar to that has been put in place in France, can be put in place and an independent investigation take place as to who knew what and when?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#H00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I rise to pay tribute to the memory of Ana Kri&eacute;gel.  Sentences were handed down yesterday to the two boys responsible for her murder.  Comments have been made in the media this morning as to how Ireland should react to the fact that we have two child murderers guilty of this heinous crime.  It is important we remember Ana as a beautiful, talented, loved young girl.  The dignity with which her family have dealt with this situation is quite inspirational.  However, we must come to terms with this horrible event, discuss it and ensure that everything that can be done in these Houses to learn a lesson is done and that nothing of this nature can ever possibly happen again.  Questions have been asked about the nature of child pornography and the extent of its availability.  Questions have been asked about the availability of smartphones.  Discussions have been had on the nature of the quite intensive and cruel bullying that seems to take place in many of our schools and among our young people.  Bullying is not just an issue for young people but it certainly seemed to be a feature of this case.  We therefore need to respond to this situation.  If Ireland has produced two child murderers, and a child has been murdered, these Houses have a duty to react in a calm, considered way that might lead society in learning some lessons from this horrible tale.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the issue of autism services in north Dublin.  I am constantly struck by the paltry level of service available on the north side of Dublin to parents of children diagnosed with autism, by the long waiting lists for early intervention and by the inability of parents to get school places for their children and associated issues.  It seems that if a child is diagnosed with autism, rather than the system wrapping itself around him or her with the care one would expect, the parents must become part-time campaigners and often must go to war with the system to get the most basic of provisions.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I would appreciate if the Leader could arrange a debate on the nature of the autism services both in north Dublin and across the country in order that we can get to the root of what is wrong and determine how we can correct it.

I have an issue with people walking and eating at the same time.  It is the worst of America coming to Ireland.<\/p> <p>There is a certain fantasy about many of the measures he has been announcing.  One of the greatest fantasies was in an announcement he made on Friday, 25 October, in a climate action youth town hall meeting in Mount Temple comprehensive school in Clontarf.  He stated the climate action plan sets out an ambitious plan for 2030.  We will have five times as much renewable energy on our grid; ten times as much retrofitting of homes and buildings; 25 times penetration of electric vehicles among our cars; zero non-recyclable plastics compared to 60% today; 500,000 extra daily public active commuter journeys and, here it is, we will have planted 250 million trees.  In ten years, we will have planted 250 million trees.  That means we will plant 25 million trees a year, which means we will plant 2,830,000 trees a month.  That means that we will plant 69,000 trees a day.  I do not know who wrote this - I think it is the fairy tales of Ireland &ndash; but we have to be very careful of these kinds of announcements that are glossed over and given to Ministers to say, and they say them with the greatest faith in the world.  This is because nobody has even asked, if we are going to plant 69,000 trees a day, where they will be planted.  Are we going to recreate Sweden or parts of Canada?  What will be the size of these trees?  The expanse between one tree and another is quite large if it is at arm's length or will there be poles?  It is ridiculous.  While I agree with much of what the Minister said, he cannot be writing the fairly tales of Ireland or not checking what is being written in announcements  I have checked it three times.  It started off as 400 million and something and it is down to 250 million but with 250 million trees, we will be walking on the top of trees from here to Galway.  A squirrel will not have to take the train.  It can walk on the top of the trees with no problem or it could swing, like orangutans.

This is the start of the process and I would like to see year-round flights.  This flight is welcome but will only fly between 29 March and 31 October.  We need support from people in the region and nationally for this route.  We welcome people from every corner of Ireland flying out of Shannon.

It is significant, with the advent of Brexit, that we will have this European hub connectivity in place in time for whatever happens with Brexit.  It will benefit not only the area in Shannon but Ireland Inc.  Shannon Airport is an international airport that happens to be based in the mid-west region; it is not necessarily a mid-west airport.  It is an international airport for Ireland that is operating significantly under capacity.  It can cater for 4.5 million passengers per year and currently caters for approximately 1.8 million.  <\/p><p>It can take one any length of time to go from one end of Dublin Airport to the other.  It is chaos to get through Dublin.  One could take a bus or transport to Shannon Airport where there is ample car parking, ample space for flying with a modern, upgraded runway.  The two airports should not be competing with one another.  There is too much of that in Ireland.  We are a small island with good road connectivity which will be shortly boosted by the M20.  <\/p><p>This is a significant announcement for Shannon Airport.  Major European hub connectivity will be in place from the end of March and guaranteed to the end of October.  I want that to be extended to being year-round and to have other European destinations.  Project Ireland 2040 aims to achieve 75% of growth outside of Dublin and Shannon Airport is a key element in that.

In June 2018, the D&aacute;il passed a motion calling for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Shane O'Farrell in Monaghan in August 2011.  This House did the same in February 2019.  Many of us in these Houses have met the devastated family of Shane O'Farrell and have learned about the shocking set of circumstances and failure of the criminal justice systems, North and South, that led to the failures which culminated in Shane's death.<\/p> <p>I met Shane's mother and father not long after his death.  I was a Deputy and justice spokesperson for my party at the time.  I will never forget the devastation inflicted on that family, particularly his mother, Lucia.  This is the quintessential Irish family - decent and hard-working, with parents who urged their children to get the best education they can.  Shane was a joy, by all accounts, a fine young man who had just qualified in medicine and was about to travel around the world.  He was a dream son who was taken away from his parents.  Deaths happen but it is unacceptable when they occur surrounded by absolute failure from those in the justice system.  <\/p> <p>These Houses voted on this matter and what has happened recently is that rather than grant a public inquiry, the Minister for Justice and Equality asked former Judge Gerard Haughton to put together terms of reference, a scoping exercise.  His Department has rejected those terms of reference and narrowed them further.  This is absolutely outrageous.  This was not only a failure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was a failure of the court system and a failure of communication, North and South, because the individual responsible for Shane's death had been involved in criminality, North and South, and has been convicted as such.<\/p> <p>I appeal for the Minister to be brought before this House, which voted by a majority for a public inquiry, to account for this disgrace and assure us that Judge Haughton will not be held back from his desire to have a proper, fully comprehensive inquiry into the circumstances of Shane's death in order that lessons can be learned and some degree of solace given to the O'Farrell family.

It has failed the people of Downpatrick, which is a rural area outside Ballycastle in north Mayo.  This scheme was recognised and designated as a number one priority for Mayo County Council.  The reason for this is if the Government does not intervene and help these people get a water supply, there will be no water supply.  The problem stems from the fact that there are naturally occurring adverse ground conditions whereby the ground contains iron, manganese and arsenic.  The water cannot really be treated.  A grant to bore a well is available and many of these people have availed of that.  When the machinery or the equipment breaks down, they cannot wash clothes or have showers.  They have to go to a village pump in the middle of Ballycastle to get some sort of proper drinking water.  They have been at this for years.  Since about 2008, they had been set and expectant that they would get a new water scheme and as we all remember, we had the economic crash and the CL&Aacute;R scheme for rural areas was discontinued.  This is a number one priority and clearly these people cannot do anything unless the Government helps them.  They have waited over the years, the rules have been modified and every time we hoped the net would be cast wide enough and they would be facilitated to get what is a basic right we all talk about, namely water.  These people have not had it for years and there has not been too much outcry over that, other than on my own part.  The issue is it is costing &euro;13,500 per house and the average cost allowed is &euro;9,000 per house.<\/p><p>My issue with this expert panel from the Environmental Protection Authority, EPA, Irish Water and the Department is there is provision within their own criteria for exceptional funding to be provided in exceptional cases.  This is an exceptional case and it ticks the boxes of their criteria, yet nowhere in the country has been given exceptional funding.  There is a clear case for exceptional funding for these 17 households.  I ask that this be revisited.  I have spoken with the Minister and I wish to highlight this here today.  These people in rural Ireland deserve fair play and a basic service.  They are old and young people and they need to live in the space they are in but they cannot do so the way the water supply is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#K00400","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I express my condolences to the family of Gay Byrne, his wife Kathleen, his daughters Suzy and Crona and his many and wide circle of colleagues and friends.

The Minister is probably due in here anyway to give us an update on rural transport so I offer encouragement for that to happen as soon possible.<\/p> <p>I also listened to \"Morning Ireland\" this morning with surprise to hear John Moran talking about the lack of local authorities drawing down Government funding available to build houses.  He bemoaned the lack of ambition of local authorities when it comes to building housing.  I tend to agree with him.  The Minister can only do so much.  The money is available so what is going on that the local authorities are not escalating the issue of building houses?  Something is wrong and there is a blockage somewhere.  I would like some clarity on that.  Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, could come in at some stage for statements on housing in order that we might hear what their perspectives on that blockage are.<\/p> <p>I was quite surprised that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality confirmed this morning that the Department has signed contracts with the provider of the emergency accommodation on Achill Island, which will have to be paid for.  We have a situation now where there are bedrooms on Achill Island, contracted by the State, with nobody in them.  It is not acceptable.  This needs to be resolved.  If 13 vulnerable women cannot go there for whatever reason, and I accept the reasons in good faith, are there any men or other people who can go down and take up this accommodation?  We have an accommodation crisis when it comes to people seeking international protection in this country and it needs to be dealt with head-on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#L00300","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Before calling on Senator McDowell and without wishing to cause any irritation, I remind Senators there is a rota of speakers which they decided on at the commencement of this Seanad.

I want to make a few points about these matters.  First, there is no point in scoring cheap political points but there has clearly been an ongoing failure of policing in the Border region.  Signs of an intimidatory kind should not be allowed to be put up anywhere on this island and should be removed the instant they go up.  The craven attitude of some people who do not understand that the rule of law must be upheld not only applies in the Border region but it applied in Cherry Orchard where Dublin City Council was advising building contractors to pay off gangland people who were extorting money from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#L01100","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Appalling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#L01200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>There is only one standard of law and it should apply everywhere on this island.<\/p> <p>The second point I want to make is that the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, has advanced a view, with which I agree, that there must be a multi-agency approach to the Border situation and to what is and what is not happening there.  The Revenue Commissioners, Army intelligence, Garda intelligence, the Garda and every force that is available North and South should be involved.  Every security force and technique that available must be deployed.<\/p> <p>The third point is that we cannot have a situation where industry is driven out of that area at the hands of people who are conducting such a campaign.  How can that area possibly prosper and who in their right mind would invest in it if this kind of behaviour goes unchallenged?  It is a challenge to the legitimacy of this State that such things were done to Kevin Lunney.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a real failure on the part of our State that this was building up incrementally and it was not taken seriously.  <\/p><p>We sometimes owe a lot to BBC Northern Ireland.  That programme was phenomenally gripping and horrifying.  I wish to say to those in Montrose that it sets a standard by which they will be judged.  BBC Northern Ireland recently ran a series on the Troubles which should be compulsory viewing in every school in Ireland.  They ran a different programme called \"Pop Goes Northern Ireland\", in which footage and pop music are shown intertwined together to show the banality of the evil that was perpetrated over so many years.<\/p><p>When I say there was a failure of policing, I am not recriminating.  I saw Garda Commissioner Drew Harris in the footage the other night following his father's coffin as a young man.  I am not throwing any personal barb at anybody in any sense.  However, we depend on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Kevin Lunney and his colleagues depend on it.  It cannot simply fail to act in response to a situation that has been going on for years, with vandalism, intimidation and the like.  <\/p><p>Paul Quinn's mother said that every bone in his body was broken when he was beaten to death with baseball bats.  His crime, apparently, was to give lip to a paramilitary in the neighbourhood.  In Crossmaglen, there is still a \"Sniper at Work\" poster on a telephone pole.  Either we are serious about the rule of law on this island or we are not.  I do not want to make points against the Minister for Justice and Equality, but I want the Government to realise that the wave of horror that came out of that programme last night, which will be broadcast again tonight, calls for a response at least as strong as that which followed the death of Veronica Guerin. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#L01300","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

Des Wilson.  I spoke in this House just a few months ago to mark the 70th anniversary of Fr. Des's ordination into the priesthood.  Given his sad passing yesterday, the best thing we could say about Fr. Des is that he was not just a believer in the gospel of hope and liberation; he was a practitioner of the gospel of hope and liberation.  The Leader shared in my sentiments at the time, and yesterday marked Fr. Des's death in his own way.  As the Leader is aware, Fr. Des fervently believed in education as a means of lifting people not only out of poverty, but out of oppression and the confines of the mind and the circumstances around them.  He left a privileged position on the pulpit to live, work and struggle among his own people.  He was steadfast in challenging the establishment, including the establishment within the Catholic Church, and for that he came under immense pressure but he never faltered.  Fr. Des always kept the faith.<\/p> <p>In the last two days in Belfast we have lost two towering figures in the struggle against injustice, inequality and oppression.  Dickie Glenholmes was a friend to many and a towering figure throughout nationalist and republican Belfast and beyond.  He equalled Fr. Des's stature in the lifelong contribution that he and his family made in their own way to changing all of our lives and circumstances.  <\/p> <p>When I mentioned Fr. Des's ordination of June this year, I sent him the video of my speech.  He then sent me a text I have just come across today.  It read: \"Thank you so sincerely for the kindness of your gesture in the Seanad and for helping us to look forward to the best years.  God Bless you and your work\".  I have no doubt that when he said \"God Bless you and your work\" he meant all of us in the Seanad.  I am very conscious that it is because of people like Fr. Des and Dickie Glenholmes that we can look forward to the best years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#M01600","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

Families and staff have received letters in this regard.  To put it in context, between 2012 and last year, St. Joseph's had a loss of &euro;7.2 million, which was covered by the St. John of God services group.  This has to be acknowledged because religious orders sometimes get much knocking here, but this order is putting its own resources into continuously propping up this successful operation.  Clearly, there is a shortfall of money that has to be found.  It is a sad day for the staff and for the families but more importantly, it is an exceptionally sad day for the clients or patients who live there and get this support.

This is something I raised, not yesterday but on the previous occasion, albeit not so much in respect of forestry.  In the previous climate debate we had with the Minister, I spoke about very ambitious targets being put willy-nilly into the proposals to prevent the worst excesses of climate change.  I spoke about the targets to have a certain million number of electronic cars by a certain date.  I raised the same issue that Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is raising, which is that if there is no relationship between goals and their achievability, that is, if one sets unachievable goals for people, the whole process is brought into disrepute.  A signal is sent out that what one is really doing is box-ticking for the sake of some other authority in order that something looks good on paper.  That might satisfy campaigners who are interested in virtue signalling around climate but it is no way to lead the public towards change that is needed.  There must be honesty about what is achievable and one cannot be setting targets that look ridiculous on paper or are ridiculous in reality as one then brings the whole process into disrepute.<\/p><p>Somewhat in the same vein, I want to pick up what has been said in respect of our policy on asylum seekers and economic migrants, which was something that I had intended to speak on yesterday but because of the tributes to Gay Byrne, I decided to wait until today.

To do so is not to evince any lack of sympathy for those who are seeking to escape poverty or to suggest that we should do nothing to help such people, it is simply to say that distinctions matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#N01500","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#N01600","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>If we do not talk honestly about distinctions or if we accuse those who make such distinctions of in some way seeking to subvert a policy of generosity and support for people from other lands who need to come to our shores in various different situations, then what we are really doing is serving our own selfish political ends by seeking to be more virtuous than the other in this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#N01700","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#N01800","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Part of what is going on here in our country is that in the absence of a perceived unifying source of moral authority, people are competing to be the most moral in the group.

All of us in this House and all citizens of the Republic stand by the right of every individual to be able to work, to have his or her own company and to be able to participate without fear of intimidation or brutality in his or her daily work and daily life.  I listened to some of the \"Spotlight\" programme which made for harrowing listening and viewing.  I also believe, notwithstanding the comments made by many about the failure of policing, that there has been a real failure of individual citizenship and community in bringing the people responsible to account.  The posters were made by a particular company, procured and erected.  People know who did it, but if we do not stand up together to the bully boy, the bully boy wins.  As Senator McDowell said, Quinn Industrial Holdings will never go back to where it was.  If we do not answer the people responsible now, there will be no investment in such areas in the future and it will be a black mark on all of us and the State.  I welcome the Garda Commissioner's meeting with the directorate.  The Garda armed support unit has been sent to the Border and there has been an increase in the level of surveillance.  There is also an obligation on individuals and communities to bring the people responsible to the fore.  People know who they are.  If we are going to allow the bully boy to win, it is a poor day for all of us.  The points related to the task force are well made.  I heard Senator McDowell speak on radio and did not disagree with anything he said.

The Government has not demurred in that regard.  As Senator Mac Lochlainn said, the Minister for Justice and Equality appointed a retired judge, Judge Gerard Haughton, to conduct a scoping exercise.  His report is due to be presented in the middle of November, following which there will be a further evaluation.  From my information which is second-hand, Judge Haughton has been engaging with the family who I think have stopped co-operating with him in the scoping exercise.  They are my words.  My information is that the Minister is awaiting the report of Judge Haughton which is due to be presented next week or the week after.  There will then be a further evaluation.  All Senators want the circumstances surrounding Shane O'Farrell's death to be fully investigated.  The scoping exercise is being carried out.  It will I hope present an opportunity for a further examination by the Minister.

There have been ongoing issues relating to financial deficits.  That poses a question about the service level agreement.  The centre receives one of the highest rates of subvention from the State.

I am glad to be back in the House working on this important legislation.  I assure the House that this Bill does not alter in any way the existing rights of teachers and other employees under current employment, health and safety legislation and other relevant legislation, nor will it interfere with disciplinary processes under section 24 of the Education Act 1998.  I appreciate, however, that the Senator is seeking to ensure the guidelines take due account of the perspective of school teaching staff and other staff alongside those of parents and students.  In that regard, I assure the Senator that there are a number of provisions in the Bill already that ensure the guidelines and school charters will be balanced.<\/p> <p>This approach is founded on shifting away from reacting to problems in schools as and when they arise to an approach that aims to improve the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools.  In doing so, it is envisaged that relationships between schools, students and parents will be strengthened and that the number of grievances in schools should reduce.  The Bill includes a specific provision to ensure the appropriate balance is struck.  We are seeking a balance and a common-sense approach that can sort out problems before there is further gridlock.  For example, it will require the Minister, in drawing up the charter guidelines, to have regard to the need for a school to foster and promote the relationship and a spirit of partnership between a school, students and their parents.<\/p> <p>The Bill also provides that the Minister must consult the education partners.  Even when this Bill passes through the House, the most fundamental stage will be consultation with the education partners.  That includes the teachers' unions.  This comprises a fundamental part of the process when developing the guidelines.  Within the primary sector, there is a good informal mechanism that acts as a very good conduit, namely, the Primary Education Forum.  At secondary school level, the unions, various partnerships and the education partners will have a say.  This consultative approach will help to ensure the perspectives of all stakeholders, including school management and staff, will be sought and taken into account in developing the guidelines.<\/p> <p>Under this Bill, a comprehensive framework will be put in place for the first time to ensure standardised grievance procedures across all schools.  All these measures aim to ensure the charter guidelines and school charters will be workable, balanced and fair to all concerned, including school staff.  Taking on board the spirit of the amendment, I reassure Senator Boyhan and the other Members that the role and rights of teachers will be protected.  They are already protected in legislation.

This is also not about reinventing the wheel.  Many schools already engage in early resolution really well.  They have their own policies in the form of their own individual charters.  Each school has good practice, a good track record and good experience in ensuring issues can be addressed early before they become potentially unresolvable.  In that regard, a central aim of this Bill is to ensure concerns of students or their parents are resolved quickly and informally without recourse to any formal complaints mechanism.  This is clear from the explicit requirement in the Bill for the Minister to have regard for the need for schools to address and resolve concerns insofar as possible at an early stage.<\/p> <p>The Bill's approach is that concerns must be raised initially in an informal manner with the school or relevant teacher and that they should be dealt with early and without recourse to any formal grievance or complaints procedure.  Concerns, therefore, will continue to be addressed initially in this informal and practical manner by schools.  However, the Bill recognises the reality that not all concerns will be resolved in this way and it therefore provides for standardised procedures to be put in place to deal with concerns that are not resolved early, for whatever reason.  Accordingly, the Bill broadly envisages a two-stage approach.  First, concerns are initially to be raised and dealt with informally and as early as possible.  The majority of issues should be and will continue to be dealt with in this way.  Second, where it is not possible to resolve an issue in this way, a grievance may be raised and dealt with through the standardised grievance procedures.  The clear distinction in the Bill between initial concerns that are dealt with informally and quickly and grievances that fall to be dealt with under the grievance procedure is important and reflects the Bill's staged approach to dealing with issues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The group of amendments proposed by the Senator would conflate these separate concepts and would not work in the context of the various other provisions in the Bill.

As I stated on Second Stage, I strongly support the Bill in general and welcome its return to the House.  It will require schools throughout the country and the communities that surround them to collaborate to produce bespoke charters that will underpin how students, parents, teachers and schools engage with, and relate to, one another.  This is a significant development in how the education system is structured and should be welcomed.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, I propose a number of amendments with the aim of strengthening the Bill and hope they will be received in the constructive spirit in which they have been tabled.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are to section 27B, a new section proposed to be inserted into the Education Act 1998.  The section sets out the guiding principles and procedures to be adhered to by the Minister for Education and Skills when drafting the national guidelines that set out how individual schools' charters are drafted, who must be consulted and what must be included.  Subsection (3) of the proposed new section sets out 11 paragraphs of specific matters that may be covered by the charter guidelines, including procedures for student consultation, school management structure and policies on voluntary contributions.  The subsection is important because it is a list of the areas the Minister will set out as matters to be addressed in the charters eventually drawn up in schools throughout the country.  With amendments Nos. 3 and 4, I propose to add two further paragraphs explicitly to indicate that they are matters to be covered by school charters.<\/p><p>In the case of amendment No. 3, I propose that the Minister will address the use of reduced timetables as an area in the charter guidelines explicitly to be covered within the charter of a school.  As Senators will be aware, reduced timetables are a practice recognised in schools where the school will arrange for a student either to be sent home before the end of the day or to arrive later than usual, reducing the contact hours of the student with his or her primary or secondary education.  As the child still attends school in theory, no notification to Tusla of school absence is required.  They have been used by teachers and school boards to manage challenging behaviour of students.  They are a shameful practice and anecdotal evidence indicates they have been used disproportionately in the case of lower-income students, Traveller students and students with a disability.  Their use must end.<\/p><p>In recent months, we in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills have investigated such practices in detail, holding public hearings with stakeholders in May and publishing an interim report before the summer that rejected their use in all but exceptional circumstances.  It is welcome that in response, the Minister's Department has published draft guidelines on the matter that require a notification to Tusla and the collection of national statistics, and that he appeared before the education committee to engage with us in September.  I also welcomed the invitation to stakeholders to submit their observations, a process in which I was happy to engage.  In my submission to the consultation group, I noted that the use of reduced timetables would decrease if teachers had greater understanding of the socioeconomic factors that might lead a child to act out in a classroom setting, and that reforms to teacher training in this regard may be useful.  I also suggested that the Minister appoint an officer, either within his Department or more regionally, to work on resolving such issues among students, parents and schools on a full-time basis, and to act as an advocate for the household.  Such a person could act not only as a mediator but also as an independent advocate for students and families with less capacity to advocate for themselves.  Finally, I suggested in my submission that we give statutory effect to the guidelines, or at least make a statutory reference to the proposed procedures for reduced timetables, within the legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill proposes a new era of collaborative decision-making and agreement in schools and families, which is the motivation for amendment No. 3.  If reduced timetables were given statutory provision in the Bill and included in the initial engagements that will lead to the first school charters being drawn up, we could reduce their incidence to zero, which would be an incredible achievement and legacy for the Bill.  I urge the Minister to accept it.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 is proposed in a similar spirit and relates to the use of seclusion and restraints in schools.  As the Minister will be aware, last September, Inclusion Ireland published a report that detailed anecdotal evidence on the use of seclusion and restraints in schools whereby a child is physically restrained by a teacher or school staff member when exhibiting challenging behaviour or, worse again, isolated in a locked space or room.  My office has drafted legislation on the matter that we have yet to table.  The report highlighted how such techniques are used mainly in the case of children with intellectual disabilities, an even more concerning detail about an already concerning practice.  Such techniques should not be used in classrooms and their use must end.  Teachers must receive the appropriate training to de-escalate episodes before such extreme techniques are required, as are national statutory guidelines and reporting mechanisms on their use, which do not currently exist, for when they may be required as a last resort.<\/p><p>A working group in the Department is examining the matter, which I welcome, and I accept that the Minister will resist making an addition to the Bill, given that the group is expected to engage in public consultation soon.  Nevertheless, my amendments are not prescriptive and will allow him to include the results of the process in the national guidelines for charters.  Measures such as reduced timetables and seclusion and restraint are often used in circumstances where families have poor relationships with schools and teachers and there is a vacuum of communication and engagement.  Expressly referring to such issues in the law governing national statutory guidelines for charters will ensure the creation of a collaborative learning environment in which it is hoped such issues would not arise in the first instance.<\/p><p>On seclusion and restraint in particular, the guidelines will need to be backed up by statutory power.  A circular will not be enough.  When such techniques are used in hospitals and social care facilities such as nursing homes, there is mandatory reporting to the HSE.  When they are used in schools, especially in the case of those under the age of 18 years, there is an even greater requirement for State regulation and reporting.  I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 4 because it will allow for statutory teeth to be given to the efforts to eliminate such concerning practices altogether.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#R00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":215,"content":"<p>What we are trying to do is broaden the scope of the legislation.  If we are specific about policies at this stage of the legislation's passage, its scope will be narrowed.  Nevertheless, that is not say the important points the Senator raised should not be highlighted within the guidelines.  She mentioned the education partners, which will have a specific role and remit in getting their voice across.  The two issues are important and I acknowledge they have been in the public domain for a while.  The Senator referred to schools using reduced timetables as a practice but they should not be used as a behavioural mechanism.  It is not acceptable that schools use reduced timetables to deal with behavioural issues.<\/p> <p>As for what we are doing, the Senator highlighted some of the steps we have taken.  Having consulted Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, my Department has drafted guidelines on the use of reduced timetables in schools.  My Department has recently invited submissions from the education partners on those draft guidelines and the matter is ongoing.  The closing date for making submissions was 25 October 2019 and my Department is considering the submissions received.  The purpose of the guidelines will be to provide clarity to school authorities, parents and guardians on the use of reduced timetables and reduced days in schools to ensure their use is limited to those circumstances where it is necessary, and that where such use occurs, schools must follow best practice, with the interests of the student to the fore.  My Department's position on the matter remains, as previously stated, that each and every child has a right to an education and all students enrolled in a school should attend for the full school day unless exempt for doing so in exceptional circumstances.  <\/p> <p>On the second issue the Deputy raised, in respect of seclusion and restraint, an expert working group established by my Department is developing new guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of behaviours that challenge, including the use of physical intervention, where such behaviour is considered likely to present serious risk of harm to the student concerned and-or others within the school environment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An expert group established by my Department is currently developing new guidelines for schools on the prevention and management of challenging behaviours, including the use of physical intervention where such behaviour is considered likely to present serious risk of harm to the student concerned or others within the school environment.  The working group's work on drafting the guidelines is at an advanced stage.  It is anticipated that the draft guidelines will be ready for consultation with the education partners later this month.  The guidelines will assist schools in responding in circumstances in which students pose an immediate threat of harm to themselves or others.  They will be underpinned by the principle that such interventions are never used for the purposes of discipline, should be applied proportionately and should not last longer than necessary.  It is expected that the guidelines will underline the importance of recording such incidents and how they are managed.<\/p><p>The amendments proposed by the Senator involve really important issues.  She has contributed to the debate on such issues at many public forums.  I thank her for her contribution in this regard.  I have availed of this opportunity to update the House on where we are at with these working groups.  I reiterate that the legislative structure we are trying to put in place involves a broad mechanism.  If we start reaching into different policy areas, the scope of this legislation will be broadened.  I am not saying that these two important issues will not be at the heart of the guidelines when the consultation begins after this legislation goes through.  Although it would be in keeping with the overall approach and aims of the legislation to single out particular policies in the manner proposed by these amendments, I do not want to narrow the scope of this legislation.  I appreciate the importance of these two points.  I have had an opportunity to update the House.  Unfortunately, for the reasons I have outlined I will not be accepting the two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#R00600","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I have heard the Minister's response.

Before I say whether I will press these amendments, I would like to know more about the working group that is looking into the issue of restraint and seclusion.  I ask the Minister to give that information to me now, or between now and Report Stage.  The parents I have been supporting are concerned about the use of exclusion in some circumstances in special schools that were set up specifically to work with kids who have extra needs.  Parents in one school have told me about the use of what they would describe as a cupboard with some sensory stuff put on the wall, which had been empty a few weeks previously.  We are talking about children who need to have Asperger's syndrome or autism meltdowns.  I am not sure whether the Minister has ever seen a child having an autism meltdown.  It is something I am very familiar with.  I am concerned that staff in schools which have been set up specifically to work with certain children try to restrain those children when they use their normal tools to regulate their emotions.  Specific things are required to support a child during an autism meltdown and to make him or her feel safe that he or she will not be harmed.  If school staff can stay the course for the few minutes - it could be ten minutes - that an Asperger's syndrome or autism meltdown lasts, the child will come out the other end in a much more relieved and regulated space.  The problem is that children in many schools are being punished for using their natural tools for the regulation of their emotions.  Their feelings may have been triggered by the sensory stuff they took in during a particular moment.<\/p> <p>I will not name the schools where staff have pulled children into isolation rooms and left them there on their own and in fear.  Those who work in a school where children have certain ways of coping should recognise that those children should not be excluded for doing the very things that help them to get on with their school day.  The working group can look at the techniques involved in obvious restraints, but I am concerned that some of the more underhand stuff might not come out with a working group.  I wonder what kind of engagement is happening between parents and the working group.  Some parents are sending their kids to school every day even though they are uncomfortable with the practices at the school.  They may have waited a year for a place in the school.  They are wondering whether their children are going to be punished - perhaps by being locked away in a room - for displaying a behaviour that is very normal to the condition they have.  They have no option other then to send them back there every day.  As a mother, I cannot imagine the impossible situation they have been put in.  I wonder what kind of engagement is happening with parents who are in this position.  They are not speaking publicly at present because they are afraid that their children will lose their school places.  There should be an avenue for parents to provide more concrete and specific examples of the use of isolation rooms.  Some of these rooms are being reframed as sensory rooms.  They were not set up as sensory rooms.  They are literally isolation rooms.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.  I am happy to withdraw these amendments on the basis that there will be further engagement between now and Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#S00400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>It is clear that the Senator's level of detail and experience on the whole issue of seclusion and restraint is really important.  I take it from what she has said that a strong voice, which is focusing on what will and will not work, needs to be heard.  This work will be presented to the education partners at the end of November, which is this month and not next month.  It is a semi-formal environment.  The primary forum is an example.  There will be individual and group consultation.  I know it will include the National Parents Council, for example.  I take the Senator's point that there are experiences out there which need to be heard because they might help to signpost us in the right direction.  I am happy to set up a meeting between my officials and the Senator.  If she wants to bring in a few parents or teachers who have been involved in this area in the past, I will be happy to facilitate that.  I thank the Senator.<\/p> <p>I will not repeat the reasons I am not accepting these two amendments.  I have highlighted those reasons.  I would like to emphasise that the need for schools to provide key information about their policies, procedures and activities to students and parents and to consult students and parents on individual school plans is central to the charter approach in this Bill.  A bottom-up approach will be taken after this legislation has been passed.  Each school will have to develop its own policies within the guidelines.  The voices of parents and students will have to be at the heart of that.  They will want to know what the specific policies for that school are.  In the legislative framework, we have presented an empowerment process for parents and students who feel they do not have a voice.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We are all in unison in regard to ensuring we have the proper framework for that to materialise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#S00500","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(k) the procedures relating to the use of seclusion and restraint in the school;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#T00300","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;(4) (a) Schools shall, in addition to 27B (3)(g), provide to both parents and the Department of Education information relating to voluntary contributions, inclusive of the total monies collected annually, and a detailed expenditure of those monies by the school; and<br \/><br \/>(b) The Department of Education shall publish this information on the website, updating it on an annual basis.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>I am delighted the Minister has just made the comment that the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that key information is given to parents.  In that spirit, I hope he will be supporting this amendment, which seeks to regulate and collate data pertaining to voluntary contributions.  I am sure the Minister would agree that is key information for parents.  As matters currently stand, the Department has none of this data available to it.  We think it is important it should have access to it and that it is published so we know how much is collected by schools on an annual basis.  As the Minister knows, some schools are using these voluntary contributions to pay for basics such as light and heat due to under-funding via the capitation grants allocated to them.  This is causing substantial pressure to be placed on parents, and students are suffering because of their parents' inability to pay.<\/p><p>It is a very practical amendment which addresses a data deficit that currently exists within the Department.  We all know of the struggles of parents to pay voluntary contributions and, as someone with three teenagers going to school at present, I have first-hand knowledge of it.  We all know that voluntary contributions, by their nature, are unjust but we know they are happening, we know they have been in place for a number of years and we know they are not going away any time soon, unfortunately.  At the very least, we hope the Minister will agree that this charter should include a requirement for information on voluntary contributions for the sake of transparency for parents in particular, but also for the Department, so we can gauge each year what is the real deficit that schools are looking at in terms of being able to provide optimum supports to students and teachers alike.

As the Senator said, this is about information for parents, whether it is &euro;2 that has been collected for a school bus to go to a swimming pool, or a golf classic that has been organised by the local parents association to raise money for the school.  It is also important in order to protect schools that people know what the money is going to be used for or where it is going to be spent.  That is why there will be very specific guidelines around the transparency structure in regard to the money that is raised and where it is spent.  The capacity will happen within the school, which will have an opportunity through its own website to inform parents and the local community.<\/p><p>The heart of the amendment, if I am not mistaken, is to ensure that we embed and copperfasten that transparency focus.  The difficulty I have with the amendment is an issue which was highlighted to me in my first week in the job at a National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, conference in Galway, namely, initiative overload and the further administrative work for principals and school leaders.  To be honest, there is already a heavy administrative burden and the last thing I want to do through this legislation is to add to that.  I do not want to compel schools to have a fully filled out administrative form going to the Department on a biannual or annual basis.  The school already has been afforded that opportunity through the website and, obviously, my Department officials will have access to all of that information as well.<\/p><p>While I am conscious of the extra administrative workload, I am also very appreciative of the spirit of this amendment because it is exactly at the heart of what we are doing in terms of transparency of information on where the money is spent.  Despite increasing capitation this year, following on from increases last year, we still have a long way to go in terms of dealing with the 11% reduction in 2009.  Schools are under pressure and they are doing quite a bit of fundraising, but where they are raising money, it is important that the school community and parents know exactly where the money is being spent.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept this amendment but I appreciate that at the heart of what the Senator is saying is an attempt to ensure transparency.

The national charter guidelines will ensure clarity and consistency of approach across schools, but it is not the Bill's intention that every school's charter will be exactly the same.  Schools, by their nature, are different one from the other.  They vary a great deal in size and circumstances, from one-teacher schools at primary level to large post-primary schools which cater for 1,700-plus students.  They have different pupil and parent cohorts, policies, activities and so on.  That is why the approach taken in the Bill allows for the guidelines to contain different provisions for different categories of schools or different categories of children.  For example, the requirements in respect of consultation with children may differ between primary and post-primary or special schools and schools with special classes.  The guidelines might provide a range of consultation options, from which a school could select the options best suited to its needs and particular circumstances.  The approach taken in the Bill, as drafted, allows the Minister flexibility in developing model charters should this become desirable.<\/p> <p>For the reasons I have outlined, I do not consider the provision should be mandatory as schools are not homogenous entities in a single one-size-fits-all model; otherwise, the limited selection of model charters would potentially be too restrictive.  I can confirm that, as part of the consultation with the education partners, I will examine whether the guidelines should include templates.  Without putting words into Senator Boyhan's mouth, something I would not dare do, having a template might be a possible way forward - for example, having one template for an ETB school, one for a community comprehensive school, one for a primary school and one for a secondary school - to meet schools' charter requirements.  It is also intended that the guidelines which must be developed following consultation with the education stakeholders will provide a clear and workable roadmap schools can follow and be sufficiently comprehensive and flexible for individual schools to put in place their own charters at school level.  Therefore, while not accepting the amendment, I am looking at developing templates as part of the consultation process.  No doubt there will be an opportunity for the education stakeholders to do this and look at a number of potential templates.  We are actively considering where we should go on this issue, but we will be at a more advanced stage on Report Stage to talk further about it.  <\/p> <p>I thank Senator Craughwell for tabling the amendment.

Many are already operating within constraints in doing administrative work.  At the same time, given that the vast majority of schools have their own open, transparent policies and do not require extra financial resources or personnel, the Bill is not about creating an additional workload for school principals or boards; rather, it is about supporting them to ensure there will be better and more meaningful engagement between a school and its students and their parents.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I said, many schools already do this really well.

As I mentioned in the last debate, the committee agreed to support the Government legislation over a Private Members' Bill from Deputy Daly because of the strengthening of the role of the Ombudsman for Children proposed in the heads of the Bill.  It is a significant altering of the statutory provisions of this Bill that they were dropped and as far as I can tell, no substantive explanation has been offered by the Minister for their removal.  I have therefore tabled an adapted version of head 6 of the general scheme of the Bill to section 27D for inclusion in the Bill to reflect the important provision that was dropped.  Amendment No. 10 allows for the Minister to make directions on foot of recommendations from the ombudsman and amendment No. 13 is a substantive provision that largely reflects the head that has been dropped since pre-legislative scrutiny.  It would require boards of management of schools to consider any recommendations made by the Ombudsman for Children during an investigation of the actions of a school by the ombudsman.  It would also allow the Minister to issue direction to said board to address the matters raised by the ombudsman.  Without such a provision, a board of management is under no obligation to take heed of the Ombudsman for Children or engage with it at all.  The amendment would also allow for the Minister to issue a direction where he or she agrees with the comments of the ombudsman.  This gives the office of the ombudsman real teeth in how it deals with and investigates schools, while still leaving the power to give directions within the political realm, preserving the independence and impartiality of the office of the ombudsman.  This was an important part of the general scheme that was debated under pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills and it is not right for it to be dropped without a full and adequate explanation.  I hope the Minister can accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#W01100","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I support this amendment.

That right is always important and that independence and impartiality Senator Ruane talks about is critically important.  I would like to see that strengthened in this legislation.

I know Senator Boyhan talked about the independence of the ombudsman as well as Senator Ruane.  The specific basis on which the Ombudsman for Children engages with schools is already enshrined in legislation.  The Ombudsman for Children does not engage with schools as a representative or advocate for the complainant or for the Department, but in order to examine the issues raised.  It seeks to work in co-operation with schools and the parent or student in question to encourage the resolution of any issues without proceeding to a formal investigation.  This approach works effectively in law and in practice.  However, the proposed amendments contain anomalies and inconsistencies and would adversely affect the ability of the Ombudsman for Children to engage with schools in a positive and co-operative manner as they currently do in the vast majority of cases.  For example, the amendment empowers the Minister for Education and Skills, who is not a party to and has not been involved in the matter under examination by the ombudsman, to direct a school to comply with any suggestions guidance or recommendations given by the Ombudsman for Children whereas it separately provides that a school is simply required to consider any such suggestions, guidance or recommendations when they are received from the Ombudsman for Children.  A number of concerns and anomalies came to light when the advice of the Office of the Attorney General came back during the drafting of this legislation.  A key concern is that these provisions would have had the effect of fundamentally changing how the ombudsman operates by compelling school boards to consider any suggestions, guidance or recommendations rather than working to encourage schools to take actions to resolve the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As anybody who has heard me speak on this matter will know, I am against using legislation to compel schools to open special classes.  I believe in operating in a spirit of co-operation and partnership.  I do not subscribe to a philosophy of compelling schools to do things.  We have a very formal system in place which promotes co-operation.  Schools are encouraged to take action to resolve the matter without having to get into the formal stages of the process.  I am in favour of things being sorted out at an early stage where that is possible.<\/p><p>There is no provision in the legislation pertaining to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children in the issuing of directions by a Minister, even on foot of a completed investigation by the ombudsman.  To include a provision that would allow the Minister for Education and Skills to issue directions arising from a preliminary or full investigation by the ombudsman would be a significant departure from the current approach and impact significantly on the manner in which the Office of the Ombudsman for Children carries out its work.  It is not something that is sought or desired by the ombudsman.  Although the approach in this context has changed from that under the original scheme, it is important to note that the overall objective of the Bill is to bring about a significant cultural change in some schools, with a shift away from reacting to problems after they arise and towards dealing with them at an earlier stage through better engagement, consultation and transparency.  Schools will for the first time put in place a standardised complaints procedure such that parents will know the score before they send their four or five year old to primary school.  They will know the exact relevant procedure if their son or daughter is in a situation that requires parental involvement.  There will be transparency in that regard in all schools.<\/p><p>These and other measures in the Bill will help to greatly improve the culture in schools and the level of responsiveness to any concern or grievance that arises.  They will bring clarity to what is required of schools, students and parents in that regard.  The approach in the finalised Bill presented to the House is appropriate and proportionate having regard to the comprehensive framework being put in place and the practical role and legal framework that apply to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p><p>These are two of three amendments the Senator has put forward related to how the work of the ombudsman interacts with the Bill.  The Senator also contributed on a previous Stage in that regard.  For the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept the amendments, but I highlight for the Senator that I am actively considering the matter raised in amendment No. 31 and will speak further to it later in the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#W01300","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I am glad that the Minister referred to amendment No. 31 at the end of his reply because my insistence on pushing this amendment is linked with that amendment.

The Minister referred to being able to informally end disputes before they reach a certain point, but the ability of the ombudsman to intervene at an early stage will be removed by section 10.  I am willing to consider whether amendment No. 10 fundamentally changes the role of the ombudsman in such matters.  There is support for the amendment.  I do not want to insert a provision into the Bill that will have a negative effect in that regard.  However, I do not wish the Bill to leave this House without the acceptance of either amendment No. 10 or amendment No. 31.  I am willing to hold back on amendment No. 10 and see what the Minister and his Department will come back to me with on amendment No. 31 which relates more to a preventative measure.  Amendment No. 10 would provide direction in worst case scenarios, whereas amendment No. 31 aims to prevent matters from ever getting to that point.

I note the amendment brought forward by my colleague with reference to the ombudsman and the response of the Minister.  The Bill seeks to establish a charter to improve and strengthen communication and co-operation between school stakeholders.  That is critical and it is a very good move.  I recognise the proposal made in the amendment on the involvement of the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p> <p>I was a member of a board of management for more than ten years and spent eight years as chairperson.  We must recognise the responsibility that lies with boards of management in terms of legislation, responsibility and accountability for implementing school policies and the proper operation of a school and its environment.  I recognise the voluntary contribution of boards of management across the country.  As Senators are aware, board members give of their time and expertise voluntarily and 99% of the time it works well and people engage in a very positive manner.  However, as the Minister is aware, in some cases problems arise and that is when things must be dealt with swiftly and appropriately.<\/p> <p>It is my experience that school stakeholders may become isolated when something goes wrong.  I refer to the discussion on transparency in the making of voluntary contributions to schools.  I also note that substantial State grants and funds are allocated to primary and secondary schools.  With that investment comes responsibility and transparency in how the funds are spent.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the charter.  This section allows for a ministerial direction where issues arise and efforts to resolve them are exhausted and unsuccessful.  That is critical.  <\/p> <p>I raise this matter - I know that the Minister is wondering - because I have direct experience as chairperson of a board of management of a situation involving financial irregularities at a school.  A whole school evaluation was carried out.  The matter was brought to the attention of departmental officials, but it was left to the voluntary board members to clean up the mess.  There was no charter or help in deciding how to deal with it.  Thankfully, a strong board working in the interests of the school, the pupils who attended it and parents who had sent their children to it stayed strong and dealt with the irregularities appropriately.  My experience was that there was very little help available from the Department.  The situation to which I refer arose long before the Minister was appointed to his current office, but a blind eye was turned to the difficulties being experienced.  <\/p> <p>It is critical that we have a charter outlining that parents and students have a right to know how a school is being run.  Certain board members will do their best to engage with parents and students, but others may not and that is when difficulties may arise.  The Bill will strengthen the hand of boards of management and those who genuinely want to see a school being run well.  It will help to fight the problem of irregularities in policy implementation, financial matters or dealing with other issues.  I have first-hand experience of these matters.  People who know me and the board I was on will know the school to which I refer.  I will not mention names in the House because it would be unfair to do so, but if it happened in the school in which I was a member of the board of management, it is happening in others around the country.  I make this point to the Minister and his officials who are in attendance.  We need to be very careful in how State funds and grants are being spent in schools.  A significant degree of autonomy is given to schools in that regard.  Boards of management are voluntary and have the best of intentions, but problems can arise.  When they do, they must be dealt with swiftly and properly.  The charter will be of assistance in that respect, but we have a long way to go before there will be full transparency and accountability for how State funds are spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#X00400","speaker":"1422"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#X00600","speaker":"1418"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 11:<\/p><blockquote>In page 8, to delete lines 35 to 39.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#X00700","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell for tabling the amendment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendment No. 11 provides for the deletion of the provision in the Bill that provides for the Minister to publish a direction issued under this Bill to a school board, together with the name of the school concerned.  Amendment No. 12 is a consequential amendment that removes the obligation on the Minister to publish a notice where he or she is satisfied that a direction given to a board has been complied with.<\/p><p>As amendments Nos. 11 and 12 are connected, I note the new section 27D proposed in the Bill provides the Minister with the discretionary power to give a board of management a direction where he or she is of the opinion that the board has failed or is failing in whole or in part to comply with its obligation to prepare, publish and implement a charter.  While it is not intended that this provision will be frequently used, it is an important provision in the context of ensuring compliance with the Bill's requirements.  It is based on applying a staged and measured approach.  The first step involves the Minister considering and being satisfied that, having regard to the failure concerned and in all the circumstances of the case, all of the relevant steps to address the non-compliance have been exhausted or it is necessary or appropriate to give a direction to the school or both.  This ensures that directions will not even be considered without significant efforts being made to engage with the school to resolve the issue.  Also, before the Minister issues any direction, the board and the patron are given a formal opportunity to make representations to the Minister, during which time they can also avail of the opportunity to take steps to rectify the issue identified.<\/p><p>For the benefit of the House, I will outline the steps involved once the Minister has formed the opinion that in all the circumstances of the case a direction is, in fact, necessary or appropriate.  Before issuing a direction the Minister must give the board and school patron notice of his or her intention to give a direction, setting out the reasons and the proposed remedial action.  The notice must offer the board and the patron, or both, an opportunity to make representations on the proposed direction and provide the board and patron at least 14 days to do so.  The board and the patron, therefore, have an opportunity to rectify the matter before a direction issues or to make representations on the proposed direction.  The Minister must, in deciding whether to give a direction, consider any representations.  Only where all of these steps have been followed and the Minister remains of the view that a direction is required will the Minister issue a direction.<\/p><p>As can be seen, a direction will only issue in cases where a school continues to refuse to comply despite significant efforts being made to resolve the issue or where it is necessary and appropriate to do so or both.  The Bill provides that in these cases, the direction will be published by the Minister.  I believe that the approach taken is measured, proportionate and appropriate.  It is not about naming and shaming schools.  It will apply where there is serious and persistent non-compliance.  It is therefore about ensuring compliance by schools with the Bill's obligations and about ensuring transparency for all in relation to this compliance.

This is a welcome provision that will allow for the engagement of the elected representatives of students with the board of management to develop a charter with the interests of students at its heart.  However, for the student council to be an empowered and equal education stakeholder partner in the drafting of the charter, it needs to be able to set its own arrangements for the election of its members and its dissolution.  Under the current provisions of section 27, the board of management is able to set arrangements for elections and dissolutions and so feasibly could dissolve a student council at a moment's notice.  It could even feasibly arise that the board of management could engage with a student council to draft a charter under section 27B and a board of management that did not like the input of the council into the process could dissolve the council as a result.  The reference to &quot;where one has been established&quot; in section 27B(1)(a)(v) would seem to give further latitude to pursue that as a drastic course of action.  The question is how a student council can substantively contribute to the development of a student charter when it is only in existence if the board of management allows it to be so.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A council derives its mandate from election by students and not the whim of management.  It is to rectify this issue that I tabled amendment No. 15, which would remove the setting of rules for the election of student council members and the dissolution of a council from the remit of a board of management and place responsibility within the remit of the council itself.  A democratically-elected body should be able to set the rules for its elections and how it will be dissolved.  The Irish Second-Level Students Union criticised the general scheme of the Bill during pre-legislative scrutiny on these exact grounds, based on the view that the Bill was changing only the aims of the student council and not addressing the important matters of dissolution and elections.  We need to empower young people to get involved in their local school communities through local student democracy and give them a real voice in decision-making at school level.  My amendment would give a student council genuine democratic autonomy and legitimacy.

The mechanism as currently provided for in the Bill does not mirror the 2014 review in that it required a full overview of all 75 raised bog NHAs.

This relates to my amendment No. 50, with which we have yet to deal, which seeks to ensure we will have that same overview.  Environmental criteria in this section relate to specific proposals that may relate to a specific dedesignation prospect.

My chief concern when it comes to blanket bogs and a comparison model is that we do not want to do anything that would create a perverse incentive where people might be encouraged to act on the basis of knowing that a more degraded bog compared to another bog may be dedesignated.

Amendments Nos. 37a to 37d, inclusive, relate to proposed changes to the definition of \"favourable conservation status\" within the Bill.  The definition is important, as the criteria it sets out will essentially set out how bogs will be evaluated within the review under this new section 18A, which ones will be determined worthy of receiving special status to preserve into the future and which will be designated as a result.  The definition, therefore, of \"favourable conservation status\" needs to be comprehensive, developed and able to fully capture the current and future environmental value and capacity of a bog habitat.  While I recognise the Government has committed &euro;5 million in 2020 to peat bog restoration, this will need to double and treble in 2021 to 2022, as &euro;5 million is unfortunately inadequate given the current state of our bog network and habitats and the important role they will need to play in the future in respect of Ireland's targets on climate action.  We, therefore, need to ensure the definitions in this Bill that will cover the review of our national bog network are robust and can be stood over.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 37b proposes to add an additional clause when a bog habitat is being evaluated whereby in addition to judging whether the structure and functions exist for its long-term maintenance and such maintenance into the future, there would be an evaluation of whether such conditions are likely to exist in the future.  These are natural biodiverse and organic environments and an assessment of their condition at a single moment in time ignores their future potential.  People are also currently being trained in bog restoration and there will be more people with the necessary skills in the future to support work of rewetting, conservation and restoration.  By altering this definition to incorporate the potential future growth of long-term sustainability, we need to make this amendment to broaden the definition and to account for the evolving skill base as more and more people become trained in bog restoration.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 37a and 37b are important and make a key change to the criteria on which the conservation status of a bog or species can be considered favourable.  The current definition uses terms such as \"stable\" and increasing\" in subsection (a) and \"favourable\" in subsection (c).  However these terms are incomplete in fully assessing the environmental value of a bog habitat in terms of its potential dedesigation, which is why we propose that the term \"significant\" would also be included in the assessment.  It is certainly the case that something may be diminished but it may still be significant.  Land may have shrunk but it could still be a key wildlife corridor.  A species may have diminished but there may be a small number as a reservation which make it significant.  To only view the environmental value of these habitats through the prism of the words \"stable, increasing and favourable\" is limited and inadequate without also an assessment of their significance.  \"Significance\" is a broader term which the Minister of State can cite in making these crucial evaluations where the limited metrics of their current stability or favourable status can be looked beyond in a fuller, more comprehensive analytic assessment. I urge him to accept these amendments considering the now widespread fears this Bill has aroused in the wider conservation and environmental movements in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#BB00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments.

In essence, this means that these habitats and species are being maintained in a satisfactory condition and that situation is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.  In this regard, the definition within the Bill has been derived by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel from the definition of \"favourable conservation status\" in article 1 of the habitats directive and in the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  I do not propose, therefore, to accept these amendments.  The definition is not by accident; rather it is based on the important definitions in the birds and natural habitats regulations.  That is in conjunction with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and, therefore, I do not believe there is a need to change the current definitions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#BB00800","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37b:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, lines 4 and 5, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;exist&rdquo; where it firstly occurs in line 4 down to and including line 5 and substitute the following:&ldquo;either exist and are likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future, or are likely to exist in the near future, or&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC00200","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC00300","speaker":"1444"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37c:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, line 5, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;or&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC00600","speaker":"1444"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37d:<\/p><blockquote>In page 6, line 6, after &ldquo;favourable&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or significant&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC00800","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC00900","speaker":"1444"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 38:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 38a and 47 are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.

In the original iteration of the Bill economic, social and cultural needs were included as a factor for consideration.  A significant and arguably an excessive concession was made by the Minister of State to also include recreational and sporting needs.  This was a regrettable and regressive move.  However, in our last debate on the Bill this already extraordinary concession was widened even further in the forcing through of amendment No. 19, an absolutely appalling amendment, to specifically allow for the de-designation of bog habitats to build, among other developments, golf courses.  That Fine Gael Senators would force through this disgraceful amendment against the advice of their own Minister of State was shameful.  It flies in the face of any attempt by the Fine Gael Party to speak with authority in tackling climate change and about the protection of national habitats and biodiversity.  I hope the Senators who supported the amendment will think long and hard about what their support for that change to the Bill says about the attitude of this House and the Oireachtas to the movement which is demanding action on climate change.  It puts all politicians in a bad light and I was ashamed to be a Member of this House when it was tabled.  The Minister of State has acknowledged the damage it will do to the Bill and I hope he will be seeking internal disciplinary action within Fine Gael for the mass breaking of the Government Whip. <\/p> <p>There is a definition of \"greenway\" in the Bill, but there is no definition of \"recreational and sporting needs\".  That opens up a concern about how it might be interpreted.  I urge the Minister of State to include some definition of &ldquo;recreational and sporting needs (including greenways) appropriate to bog habitats&rdquo;.  The idea that a natural bog habitat would be destroyed to build a golf course would fill most people in the country with horror.  We need to provide some assurance that that will not be the case and establish this House as one that is serious about tackling climate change and protecting the natural environment, of which we are the custodians.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.  I have also tabled amendment No. 47 which would allow the Minister to ask the EPA to draw up guidelines for what would constitute recreational and sporting needs, in the absence of a definition being added to the Bill, and which I urge the Minister of State to accept as an alternative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC01600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I too was shocked, disappointed and ashamed to be a Member of this House when the Fine Gael amendment was passed last week, particularly given, as Senator Ruane said, that we had already in previous weeks passed a Government amendment to allow for the designation of a natural heritage area to cease on the basis of sporting needs.  Why, then, is there a need for a reference to golf courses?  I support amendment No. 38a.  Bogs cultivate over thousands of years and their removal for the purpose of the development of a golf course is terrible State and Government policy.  When we think of the removal of woodlands across the island throughout our history, going from almost complete to minimal coverage, and the environmental impact it has had, we should also consider the impact of the removal of bogs for something that would probably only benefit the next generation in the short term.  It would take hundreds of years to regenerate the peat removed.  For example, 15 cm of peat contains more carbon per hectare than a tropical forest.  For the purpose of the development of an 18 hole golf course, or the extension of a golf course from nine to 18 holes, 40 to 80 ha of peat layer would be removed when 15 cm of thick peat layer contains more carbon per hectare than a tropical forest.  We will be supporting amendment No. 38a.  As I said, the Fine Gael amendment passed during the debate last week does not differentiate between mass removal and something that might infringe slightly on bogland.  It is way too blunt.  It is entirely unreasonable to suggest we should enact an amendment to provide for the removal of peatland for the purpose of the development of a golf course.  I ask others to support amendment No. 38a.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#CC01700","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I understand the purpose of amendment No. 38a is to exclude &ldquo;golf courses&rdquo; from the &ldquo;recreational and sporting needs (including greenways) appropriate to bog habitats&rdquo; criterion that is proposed to be included among the criteria to be utilised in selecting the most suitable bog habitats to be designated or to cease to be designated as natural heritage areas.  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 strikes a balance between the need to maintain or restore bog habitats to a favourable conservation status, live up to our EU obligations and work with landowners and turf cutters.  Bearing this balance in mind, there may be grounds for amending the boundaries of a natural heritage area to include appropriate recreational or sports facilities so long as areas of active bog habitat within a site can be maintained and areas of degraded bog habitat can be restored.  There may also be opportunities to develop recreational facilities such as walking routes or greenways within NHAs, building on existing routes within the sites.<\/p> <p>The Government amendment to the Bill provides that the purposes of a natural heritage area review include selecting the most suitable bog habitats, first, to be designated as NHAs and, second, to cease to be designated as NHAs having regard to various criteria, including &ldquo;recreational and sporting needs (including greenways) appropriate to bog habitats&rdquo;.  The provisions of each criterion have been and will continue to be carefully considered in conducting and completing any review of NHAs.  In addition, any regard to recreational and sporting needs appropriate to bog habitats in a review of NHAs would be subject to a strategic environmental assessment, including public consultation and the carrying out of any other screening for an assessment or, as the case may be, assessment, if required.  I understand the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would be obliged to consult the Environmental Protection Agency in the strategic environmental assessment process.  Therefore, I consider that there are sufficient principles and criteria within the Bill to guide the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in conducting and completing a review of NHAs.  Therefore, I will not be accepting the amendments.<\/p> <p>My understanding is Senators Higgins and Ruane have concerns that the provisions in the Bill will allow for new golf courses to be built within raised bog or blanket bog NHAs.  I do not believe that was the intention of the Senators and they certainly did not state it in reference to new golf courses, although I know that there was a debate about existing golf courses, which is the reason the amendment has arisen.  Therefore, I am willing to consider whether the &ldquo;recreational and sporting needs (including greenways) appropriate to bog habitats&rdquo; criterion within the Bill might need to be amended to set out clearly that the development of new golf courses would not come within it.  Even though I believe there are sufficient principles and criteria within the Bill to guide the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in conducting and completing a review of NHAs, I will also consider whether it would be appropriate for the Bill to be amended to provide for guidelines to be drawn up for what may or may not be considered to be \"recreational and sporting needs (including greenways) appropriate to bog habitats\".  I will look at this issue again in the context of amendments in the D&aacute;il.

This definition within the Bill has been carefully drafted and links to the methodology utilised for the 2014 raised bog natural heritage areas, NHA, review.  I do not propose to accept this amendment to it.<\/p> <p>The 2014 raised bog NHA review proposes the de-designation of sites where it has been judged that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal and-or that restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved.  The review also proposes the designation as NHAs of 25 currently undesignated raised bogs, which are in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure.  These sites are to be proposed for designation to make up for the loss of habitat within the NHA sites where turf cutting is to continue.<\/p> <p>The 2014 review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitats through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network.  The review clearly set out that the proposed newly configured network would have considerable advantages over the current natural heritage area network, including a greater area of both active and degraded raised bog still capable of regeneration compared to the current network and increased potential for more rapid restoration of raised bog due to the inclusion of State-owned lands into the new network.  This is the point, namely, that the network will be enhanced in terms of area and would be reduced in terms of ownership, that is, individual owners, because more State lands would be designated, which would be positive because of the overall view taken by small farmers or small landowners that the State has loads of hectares of land that are not designated, and that these small farmers or small landowners are being targeted.  That is a positive development as the overall network has increased with this review.<\/p> <p>The heart of the 2014 review and any future review would be the nature conservation objectives of maintaining bog habitats at, or restoring bog habitats to, a favourable conservation status.

This report would assess the rewetting potential of all natural heritage bogs.  When Dr. Renou-Wilson was before the climate action committee last week, she clarified that the survey previously undertaken on raised bogs looked to restoration potential but did not consider rewetting.  The ideal outcome for a bog is full restoration but rewetting is still of considerable value.  While a bog which is restored may draw carbon from the air, a bog which is rewetted may still prevent carbon emission.  Rewetting is a baseline activity.  A total of 46 bogs were designated as having less restoration potential.  Those bogs have not been examined specifically for their rewetting potential.  We need to know that in any decisions made as to their NHA status, their rewetting potential has been considered.  Let us not forget that there has been a direct cost to the State as a result of carbon emissions in terms of both environmental damage and fines paid.  These costs will significantly outweigh compensation payments being paid to landowners with raised bogs designated as NHAs.  In the future we must move past compensation payments and towards giving landowners payments that actually support carbon sequestration and conservation on their land.  We have consistently tried to remove blanket bogs from the Bill.  A review over the course of 12 years was undertaken in respect of raised bogs but none was undertaken in respect of blanket bogs.<\/p> <p>With amendment No. 50, we seek to set an overall survey and a baseline minimum.  We need to ensure we do not simply allow for consultation over a particular bog on whether it is designated but rather that an overall survey is conducted in order that we know the total blanket bogland we have and its restoration or rewetting potential.  This is essential before we look to the process that may lead to the dedesignation of boglands.  All 75 raised bog NHAs were fully examined in the past but we have not had any similar examination of our blanket bogs, including rewetting and the other kinds of scientific criteria.  This amendment would ensure we have a baseline.  The amendment also relates to amendment No. 51.  It would be very worrying if we provided a perverse incentive for dedesignation, whereby there would be intentional degradation of bogs in order to increase their likelihood of dedesignation.  This must happen before any orders are made and I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#HH00400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>The 2014 review concluded that Ireland could more effectively achieve conservation of threatened raised bog habitat through focused protection and restoration of a reconfigured network, which, under the proposed new network, will be 765 ha, compared with an area of 694 ha in the current network.  This restoration programme links with the peatland actions contained in the Government's climate action plan.  Under the 2014 review, 36 existing NHAs are to remain designated.  This includes seven sites which are to be divided, with part to be conserved and part dedesignated, and 46 NHAs which are to be dedesignated, including the relevant areas of the seven sites to be divided, where it has been judged that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal or that restoration would be prohibitively expensive for the conservation benefits achieved or both.  Twenty-five currently undesignated raised bogs which are in public ownership or in respect of which there is reduced turf cutting pressure are to be proposed for designation.  This is in order to make up for the loss of habitat within the NHA sites where turf cutting is to continue.<\/p> <p>In summary, 61 sites are scheduled to be restored by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department as raised bog NHAs in order to maintain or restore active raised bog habitat within these sites.  There is a balance within the Bill, as regards the 2014 review of the raised bog NHA network, between the need to protect the environment, live up to our EU obligations and work with landowners and turf cutters, on whose lives these obligations can have a very real impact.  I am concerned that amendment No. 49 would upset that balance and I am therefore not in a position to accept it.<\/p> <p>I believe that the current condition, restoration potential and matters referred to in section 16(6) of the Act of 2000 would all be essential components of any future review of blanket bog NHAs.

I am delighted to be here following the publication of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee's report on small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland in May of this year.  I congratulate Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for his excellent work on the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector.  As an entrepreneur, he was in a strong position to talk about the importance of that sector in Ireland.  I also congratulate the Chairman of the committee, Senator Paul Coghlan, on the publication of this thorough and well-formulated document.  Documents such as these are important and are useful dictionaries for us when preparing policies in respect of SMEs.<\/p> <p>I adhere to the central premise of the report, which is that the Government should focus its business policies and support to ensure the best business environment in Ireland.  The committee is preaching to the converted.  I have been working hard on the SME agenda for the past three and a half years in my ministerial role in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I have frequently and repeatedly promoted Irish SMEs and entrepreneurs at many events throughout the regions and internationally.  I have been on many trade missions and have had a lot of bilateral meetings with Ministers and it is amazing that the SME sector is important no matter where one goes.  It does not matter what kind of economy it is, even in the largest economy in the world, the SME sector is always important.<\/p> <p>I take note of the many recommendations, such as the recommendation that a coherent and comprehensive strategy for SME development be developed.  I am also glad the committee captured the need to increase the capacity of SMEs to participate in global value chains.  I was particularly interested in its recommendation that a regional ecosystem approach be adopted, which would involve identifying regions as specialist areas for targeted cluster or hub buildings. <\/p> <p>As a Government, we want to create policies and programmes that are of value to the business community.  I want SMEs to feel confident that they are getting the best available supports when they approach any agency or Department of this Government.  To do this, it is sometimes important that our country look outside itself for expertise.  That is why last year we reached out to the OECD, one of the most reputable research organisations in the world, to carry out work on the importance of the SME sector in Ireland and on how we should move forward.<\/p> <p>I would like to take Senators on the journey I took with the Department and its officials on engaging with the OECD on SME policies and evaluation.  Internally, the Department, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I had wanted to take the next step in bringing together SME policies spread throughout the Department, other Departments and a number of agencies.  While we were all doing Trojan work to support SMEs, there needed to be a review of what was out there, whether it was working for us, and how it could all be brought together. <\/p> <p>To investigate how best to do this, I led the Irish delegation to the OECD ministerial meeting on SMEs in Mexico city in February 2018.  Here, I could see the scope of what the OECD could bring in many areas.  Of particular interest to me, because of my responsibility for EU single digital market affairs, was how to digitise SMEs and how to get the best out of the digital world to give our SMEs the competitive advantage we want them to have.  I spoke on that matter as part of a panel of experts.  These high-level engagements, along with numerous conversations with the Secretary General, &Aacute;ngel Gurr&iacute;a, gave me confidence that working with the OECD on these topics would be benefit all of us in Ireland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Pat Breen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At the end of 2018 we were provided with an early draft of the review.  One of the most prominent recommendations was to form an interdepartmental group, led by a Minister, and consisting not only of policymakers but also of agencies, representative groups, academics and more important - and Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will agree with me on this - to ensure we have the businesses themselves included.  We held our first meeting in March.  Many of the people we targeted for this group were present at that conference in July and were here when we launched the review last week.  Subsequent to this, we broke it up into pillars, asking for members' expertise to drive forward areas such as standards, skills and internationalisation.<\/p><p>In April of this year, I led the Irish delegation at the working party on SMEs and entrepreneurship.  We presented the first draft to the working party at the OECD headquarters in Paris.  Four countries peer reviewed it, namely: Canada; New Zealand; Italy and; Sweden.  It is important to get a mix of similar open economies with countries like Sweden but also different countries such as Canada.  One will then see the best practice models from both types of economy within the review.  There was great enthusiasm for the Irish review in the working party, and we received constructive feedback from quite a number of delegates.  I met with the Deputy Secretary-General of the OECD during that visit and also explored the advantages of the work in the digital area in the OECD, which could be brought into policy in Ireland.<\/p><p>This is an area of the review and roadmap I would like to emphasise, particularly as it is an area under my remit as Minister of State.  Digital advancement is an area where Irish SMEs can bridge the gap with the larger multinationals, particularly in the area of productivity.  That is something we will highlight this afternoon during the debate and we will examine how we can get Irish SMEs to be more productive and to compete with the big multinational companies.  The Government is concerned about that gap, so much so that it is the theme of Future Jobs Ireland, pillar 2 of which is to increase SME productivity.  I remember at the Mexican ministerial summit, the delegates also identified this as an area of priority.  We can see the importance of the digitalisation process as an action in the roadmap of the report the OECD presented for us.  An area of that report mentions ramping up support for the digitalisation of SME business processes.  It is an important area because we know the Irish SMEs perform well in the DESI, digital economy and society, index, as the country with the highest percentage of SMEs selling online, the highest level of e-commerce revenue and the most sales cross-border.  However, this recommendation relates to digital programmes such as enterprise resource planning and the use of the cloud.  I want to push these solid, tried and tested technologies into the business world of our SMEs.  The roadmap we have presented in conjunction with the report recommends that the LEOs take a leading role in this process.<\/p><p>To bring Senators onwards on the journey, I also spoke at an excellent SME and entrepreneurship strategy conference last July in the Aviva stadium.  As Senators know, the keynote address was given by the Taoiseach.  Just last week, we launched the OECD report and review with OECD Deputy Secretary-General Knudsen in our Department buildings and we will now work with my officials to drive forward the SME agenda throughout Government.  Following on from this, I will be attending the OECD's digital for SMEs global initiative on 29 November in Paris.  Also, I want to let the Senator know of my deep commitment to ensuring Ireland is at the heart of international SME policy.  I will also be attending a useful meeting in Helsinki in November.  It is organised by the European Commission and it is important Ireland is represented there because this will be the first meeting of the new Commission under President-elect von der Leyen.  This meeting will be on the area of European SME strategy.  We will get an idea at that meeting of how much the new Commission prioritises SME strategy.  That is why I am determined to drive the SME and entrepreneurship agenda through the recently established SME and entrepreneurship consultative group, which I am chairing, and we had the first meeting in March.  This brings together policymakers and programme managers from our agencies such as Enterprise lreland and the LEOs, all sitting alongside representative groups and businesses themselves.  I will lead this group into developing an inclusive SME and entrepreneurship strategy to form part of the Future Jobs Ireland framework.<\/p><p>Working together, we can achieve far more than each on their own agenda.  The all-time giant of basketball, Michael Jordan once said: \"talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.\"  We see here today that it requires a collaborative effort, putting aside any differences and working together to a common goal; to make Ireland a great place in which to own and operate a business.  That is why the Government places huge priority on the area of entrepreneurship and start-ups.  They are really important, particularly for the regions and it is important we have start-up companies growing all the time because when a small company is successful it grows.  We have agencies like the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland that will help them to grow on that journey so they can become an export company.<\/p><p>I would also like to give the committee some background on the current situation for small business owners in Ireland.  I understand the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy.  The latest CSO business in Ireland report states that in Ireland, SMEs accounted for 99.8% of or 249,450 active enterprises and over 68% of all persons engaged in SMEs generated 50.2% of total turnover in the business economy and over 41% of gross value added was attributed to these enterprises.  SMEs are operating in every county, community, town and village and are so strategically important - as Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will know - for all rural areas of Ireland and people in rural Ireland see the benefits of these small micro-enterprises in their areas.  We all know multinationals tend to go into clusters in the large urban areas, and so I believe our policy of having 31 LEO offices around the country is paying off.  The LEOs have created a lot of jobs in recent years and I believe they will continue to do so in the future.  That is why they are so important for us and I want to see people continuing to live in rural communities.  It is to everyone's benefit that rural Ireland prospers and grows.  SMEs are the key to this.  I am determined to provide the supports that allow this to happen.  If we want people to remain in rural communities, especially young people, we need to provide them with quality and rewarding jobs.  Primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, Irish SMEs can access supports in areas such as access to finance - which is so important for many companies; skills enhancement, because upskilling is extremely important and; assistance in exporting and in research and development.  Research and development is really important as well.  I always say that companies that do not innovate will evaporate and that is why they need to be evolving all the time.<\/p><p>The business environment in the regions will not return to what it was in the past.  I am not saying that in a negative way.  It will be different.  We have to adapt to new ways of working such as remote working; co-working spaces; and digital hubs.  That is why we are supporting new regional projects such as the Ludgate Hub in Cork, Donegal Digital innovation hub, the Kilkenny Carlow design innovation hub and the Kildare community network to name a few.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will know about the hub in Galway city as well, which is very successful.  We have invested heavily through the regional enterprise development funds administered by Enterprise Ireland to support regional stakeholders, both in the public and the private sector, to work together and to bring forward initiatives that build on each region's capacities and strengths.  So far, we have invested nearly &euro;60 million in 42 projects under the regional enterprise development fund.  All regions received funding under that competitive fund.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, will shortly be announcing the successful applicants from the &euro;45 million regional enterprise development fund 3, which was launched in the summer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Pat Breen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In recognition of the key role they play, the funding for LEOs has increased by 22% since I have been in the Department.  This is used to assist microenterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they do business.<\/p><p>Most recently in July, two new funds worth &euro;3 million were announced.  The first is the competitive challenge fund, a &euro;2.5 million LEO competitive fund to support LEO-led projects, in alignment with the framework of the future jobs Ireland strategy and the regional enterprise plans.  The projects will focus on new approaches and emerging innovations towards fostering and creating sustainable employment and improving productivity through collaborative and joined-up approaches.  On 4 October, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced the approval of 16 LEO projects to receive the &euro;2.5 million support.  The second is the LEO productivity challenge fund of &euro;500,000, which is now open.  This is an important fund as it is primarily aimed at supporting domestically focused small businesses rather than exporters.<\/p><p>The funds will help small businesses to identify opportunities in addressing productivity gaps, embedding the Lean practice we all talk about, greening their businesses and, of course, reducing waste.  This initiative will also focus on training and capability development, thereby enhancing customer experience, time and performance management.  The scheme is aimed at enterprises employing fewer than 50 people in a variety of sectors and will be delivered via 200 productivity vouchers valued at &euro;2,500 each to help them develop a more efficient and productive business operation.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland is supporting indigenous businesses in every county.  For example, the numbers in Longford increased from 1,642 to 2,979 in that period.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies sustain more than 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide.  Enterprise Ireland's records show that last year, 65% of jobs were created in regions outside Dublin.  I want businesses to see the wide range of Government supports available to them so they know where to go.  This is why I emphasise the importance of the LEOs as the first-stop-shop for many people who want to start a business.  I want small businesses to use these supports to seek out new opportunities at home and abroad.  I want them to take advantage of the digital revolution going on around us.  The digital economy is changing the way we do things and many of the children born today will work in jobs that have not yet been invented.  We see the use of robotics, artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  We must ensure our SMEs embrace this technology.  They must be more productive, as the OECD report stated.  They must be leaner so they can compete on the global stage.  The digital revolution will bring quality jobs to all of us.  It will bring quality jobs to every county, town and village in Ireland.  The SME sector is crucial, which is why the Taoiseach appointed me as Minister of State with responsibility for small business in 2016.  It is a great honour because it represents so many communities in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#MM00600","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":417,"content":"<p>It was my honour in my role as Leas-Chathaoirleach to chair the proceedings of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on SMEs, ably assisted by our excellent rapporteur.  I welcome the Minister of State for this important debate.  I acknowledge the work he is undertaking to bring about improvements in this challenging brief.  I specifically acknowledge the input of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, at the public hearings on this topic.<\/p> <p>SMEs are the main source of jobs in the economy and it is important we do everything to support the sector, which is such a key source of employment.  I was a businessman before I entered national politics and I know only too well that the operating environment for business Ireland, particular SMEs, can be challenging.  Business owners are men and women who take significant risks to develop their passion.  Many of the contributors to the public hearings of the committee spoke about the contribution of SMEs to the social fabric of a community, their importance to sustaining communities through job creation, particularly in rural communities, and their potential role in environmental sustainability.  It has been found that the majority of family-owned SMEs measure success beyond profit and growth to a long-term commitment to communities and employees.  This underpins the value of SMEs to local communities on whose support they rely.<\/p> <p>Many of the contributors to the public consultation felt there was a lack of support for family businesses.  Business owners often work well over 100 hours per week, risking all they and their families have, including their homes and personal assets and finances.  As a small open economy, Ireland is, and always has been, exposed to factors outside its control.  While SMEs have seen sustained growth in recent years, the potential impact of Brexit looms large as a new challenge for the sector.  The importance of safeguarding Ireland's trade interests with the UK is paramount as Brexit unfolds because it will have an enormous effect on SMEs that export goods to the UK.  We are inevitably moving towards a less competitive and more expensive trading relationship between Ireland and the UK and SMEs will need time to transition, depending on the nature of the new trading arrangements.  While the final shape of Brexit is not yet known, Ireland wants as close as possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including on trade, to minimise the impact of jobs and businesses.  I wholeheartedly support this aim.<\/p> <p>The committee heard the increasing cost of doing business in Ireland and a tax system that puts smaller businesses at a disadvantage are major issues for SMEs.  The increasing cost of rent, insurance and rates are of particular concern to SMEs as they threaten the very viability of their businesses and are a barrier to business growth.  The capital gains tax rate of 33%, increased from 20%, is at odds with other countries throughout the world.  This can adversely impact people who wish to retire or sell on their businesses.  An improvement in tax rates would allow SME owners invest in their businesses or new businesses.  The committee has made recommendations in the report on finance and funding supports for SMEs.<\/p> <p>It is a well-known fact that banks have become extremely risk averse since the downturn.  The committee heard that the need to sign personal guarantees to get finance to start a new business can be a major deterrent to somebody thinking of starting up, balanced against the risk of giving up a regular salary and removing the safety net of the social welfare system.  Ultimately, the fear of failure can become a stronger emotion than the hope of success.  The committee has made a clear recommendation in its report that the requirement to sign personal guarantees as collateral should cease.<\/p> <p>Public procurement policy was another issue raised.  It was identified by the Construction Industry Federation and other witnesses as a barrier to SMEs tendering for big contracts that should be simplified.  The committee has made recommendations in the report to address some of the challenges in this area.<\/p> <p>In line with Europe, Ireland has a rate of 9% female entrepreneurs.  The committee heard Ireland could become the best in Europe for female leadership opportunities.  Six years ago, 8% of start-ups were female-led whereas last year, 28% were female-led.  The committee has made recommendations in the report calling for the development of a national strategy on female entrepreneurship.<\/p> <p>As we all know, SMEs generally start on a small scale but they have the opportunity to become global players.  For example, Kerry Group has enjoyed phenomenal success since commencing operations in 1972 on a greenfield site in Listowel, County Kerry.  The company has evolved from modest beginnings to become a leading player in the global food industry.  Dairymaster, an Irish company based in Causeway, County Kerry, is a leading dairy innovation and technology companies in the world.  We have also had the phenomenal success of Fexco, which was started, and is headquartered, in Killorglin.  These companies are a perfect illustration of the importance of innovation, which is key to growth.<\/p> <p>The committee heard that entrepreneurial education should be made part of the school curriculum, starting at primary level.  The committee acknowledged the great Kerry entrepreneur, Mr. Jerry Kenneally, who started the junior entrepreneur programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">An Leas-Chathaoirleach:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That programme has made an impact on young students and their thinking.  Mr. David Walsh, chief executive officer of Netwatch, reminded the committee that the entrepreneurial mindset comes at an early age when families discuss business at the kitchen table.  The Government has a key role in creating the appropriate conditions to support the SME sector.  The committee is of the view there should be a stronger unilateral focus at government level on SMEs and recommends in this report that there should be a dedicated Minister of State for SMEs to develop a policy that fully embraces the diversity of the SME population and the challenges and opportunities this brings, particularly in the context of international developments.  The recommendations set out in this report are a valuable and timely input into identifying and addressing the challenges faced by the SME sector and I look forward to engaging further with the Minister of State, who I know takes a strong interest in this issue.<\/p><p>I pay particular tribute to Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for proposing this topic for discussion and for acting as rapporteur in the drafting of this report.  The Senator's practical expertise and insight to business start-ups and job creation was invaluable to the committee during the course of this public consultation.  His passion for encouraging and supporting SMEs in starting and developing their businesses was the reason he proposed this topic for public consultation.  I also thank our excellent secretary, Ms Bridget Doody, who kept us all on track and made us attend to detail, particularly the Chairman.  I acknowledge that as well.  I thank all the members of the committee for their engagement in this public consultation.  I again sincerely thank all those who sent submissions to the committee and I thank the witnesses who appeared before the committee.<\/p><p>I have great pleasure in calling on our rapporteur, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, to address us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#OO00200","speaker":"1420","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it anseo inniu.

I would also like to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his support in the promotion of this as a topic for investigation and in the preparation of this report for the committee.  I very much appreciate that as well as the help from all the other committee members.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Ms Bridget Doody, Ms Carol Judge agus Ms Ilinca Popa.  I also, in particular, thank Dr. Majella Giblin, who is in the Gallery with her mother, Rhona.  It is good of her to come here.  Dr. Giblin works in National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Dr. Giblin and to Eoghan McCarthy in the National University of Ireland Maynooth, NUIM, who helped with the graphics and county analysis, for their work on academic, evidence-based research along with their colleagues to help develop an evidence-based strategic document to help us as legislators and policymakers to go and create something of substance.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this report arose when I became a Taoiseach's nominee.  I asked the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, what he thought my focus should be in the Seanad.  I also asked Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin what he thought my focus should be separately.  Both of them mentioned entrepreneurship and SMEs and told me that is what I know about and that is what is in my DNA.  That was my focus.  From day one, I started working in this space and in developing this space.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service was also very helpful.  This is down to 18 months to two years of a journey that has been in gestation and has been continually developing from there.  The purpose of the report is to create the landscape of what SMEs are like in Ireland and to examine where we are.  There are two parts to it.  There is a cross-sectional part and there is a lateral perspective to it.  That is looking at it on an industry by industry basis.  We asked questions about what the tourism sector is like in Ireland, what financial services in Ireland are like for SMEs and so on.  Then when we looked at in a vertical manner on a county by county basis and we discovered significant differences between SMEs in Dublin, for example, and those in Cork, Kerry and Donegal.  For example, in Kerry and Donegal, almost 20% of all the SMEs in those counties are focused on tourism and hospitality.  It is approximately 8% in Dublin.  The strategy from a policy perspective for SMEs in Dublin is different from what is needed in the regions and that is what the report highlighted.<\/p> <p>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach rightly said, this came from SMEs and the industry.  Together with Dr. Giblin and others, we developed the formulation of the model around that.  The process was based on direct and indirect evidence.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Minister of State said, 98% of businesses are SMEs.  They employ approximately 1 million people around the country and there are 250,000 of them, which is a significant number.  The document makes 129 recommendations.  I will not go through them now but there are a number of key areas.  I recognise what the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, the Minister of State at the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy D'Arcy, and their colleagues have done with SMEs.  In fairness, the Government has helped bring this issue up the ladder and up the scale in prominence.  I go back to 2012 when the then Government got the pillar banks to say they would allocate &euro;3.5 billion towards loans to SMEs, and that happened.  I acknowledge that and we need to push this on to the next stage.<\/p> <p>Many of the issues the Minister of State highlighted are highlighted in the report.  I will mention a couple.  I will come back to the LEOs but I will give the Minister of State a sense of where we are with the start-ups up to the end of quarter 3 2019.  There were approximately 5,500 start-ups in quarter 3.  In total, since the start of the year, 17,120 companies have started up.  Some 42% of those were in Dublin, 8% in Cork, 3% in Galway and another 3% in Limerick.  I am hugely supportive of Dublin and I am proud of it as a capital but we need to create different types of support mechanisms for the different regions.  That does not mean we do not support Dublin.  We support Dublin big time.  I would be as much of a Dublin supporter as anybody in every way, except in Croke Park.<\/p> <p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation produced a report in June 2019 on supporting indigenous businesses.  The focus was on State support for businesses.  That complemented the document we created because that came from the SME perspective.  The OECD report the Minister of State referred to was launched last week.  It totals 286 pages and relates to 55 members of the OECD.  It is a very significant report.  I again appreciate and commend the Minister of State on initiating that report.  I read the report at the weekend and it was done in a macro sense, looking at where Ireland is compared with other countries.  We are looking at talking to the SMEs to find out where they are and what they want and need.  That is in our report.<\/p> <p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has stated there are 170 different Government supports from 27 different Departments and agencies.  We need to focus on that.  The OECD report mentions that as well.  In the Department's report in June 2019, synergy was also mentioned, as was connectivity.  We do not have connectivity between all the different supports.  We are not looking for more money, believe it or not; we are looking for focus and we do not have that.  That must be the next layer and the next strategy.  That is what the OECD said in its report that compared us with other countries.  That would be a positive direction for us to go in.<\/p> <p>Regarding action, we definitely need a Cabinet Minister to synchronise it.  The Department highlighted that in a recent report.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned procurement as well.  Over the next five years, the State will offer &euro;100 billion in procurement contracts.  Irish companies will get less than 3% of that.  An SME in any other European country would be getting up to three times that.  In fact, SMEs are seriously hindered from tendering for Government contracts.  The Minister of State should acknowledge at the end of this debate that this is something he will focus on.  I would appreciate that.<\/p> <p>I hope others will speak about female entrepreneurship.  That is important and Enterprise Ireland is doing powerful work in a number of areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2482\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2482&amp;amp;pid=PadraigOCeidigh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->With regard to one such area, I do not know if the Minister of State has seen the document called \"Powering the Regions\".  This is Enterprise Ireland's regional plan.  Enterprise Ireland is executing a very good strategy in this area.  A person in the organisation called Mark Christal is leading on it.  <\/p><p>Another area which is important to me is that of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, which the Minister of State mentioned.  There are 31 LEOs in Ireland.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been given responsibility for one of them, but it has not been given any funding in that regard.  All of the other LEOs are receiving funding to develop small businesses, but the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta LEO is not.  Something is askew there.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would actively look at this issue.  We are not talking about a lot of money but rather just the provision of a few resources.<\/p><p>I may be coming near the end of my time.  All of my colleague Senators here, including the Leas-Chathaoirleach, have direct experience in the SME sector.  Senator Devine and I were speaking a while back and I was taken aback when she said that her husband has a business of his own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#PP00200","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":421,"content":"<p>It was fortunate to survive the crash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#QQ00200","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>That is what we have in Ireland - resilience.  We need to develop that resilience and empower more of our SMEs and people to take the risk.  I have judged a variety of entrepreneurial programmes in Ireland and I have seen hundreds and hundreds of business plans.  Companies do not grow; people grow.  The environment must be provided to allow people to grow.  The work our committee has done, the work I have been doing for years, and the research on which Dr. Giblin and her colleagues have been working is all about ascertaining how we can empower people to grow and develop businesses.<\/p> <p>We need to decide on key performance indicators, KPIs, in order to know whether we are doing well or poorly with regard to supports.  I mentioned research and development.  This is primarily the focus of large companies.  Small companies do not do it.  That is a fact.  Why do they not do it and why do they not access those vouchers?  We need to support them in breaking through those barriers.<\/p> <p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned personal guarantees.  These are absolutely critical.  I echo what he said in that regard.<\/p> <p>There is another thing which is very important in respect of productivity.  The vouchers are part of it, but another big part is education and our connections with people like Dr. Giblin and others.  These connections allow us to build a Venn diagram in which there is an overlap between business, SMEs, the intelligence and ability of academics, and evidence-based research.  We are very weak on that.  We are much weaker than many other countries, hence our research.  I ask the Minister of State to drive Cabinet and to lead in developing that area.  I am sure he can do it because I know his passion for it.  We have spoken about this area on a number of occasions, albeit briefly.<\/p> <p>One of things I am pushing hard is the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018.  It has gone through all Stages in the Seanad and is now before the D&aacute;il.  I have spoken with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and he and the Government will support it in the D&aacute;il, as will Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Will the Minister of State proceed with this as soon as possible so that it can go through the D&aacute;il and become law by Christmas, because insurance is a huge issue?  Insurance and Brexit are the two big issues we hear about in respect of SMEs.  We do not have legislation like the perjury Bill in Ireland, although every other developed country has.  There is perjury legislation in Northern Ireland and the UK, but not in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>Those are my few asks of the Minister of State.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis.  I know he is passionate about this issue.  I very much welcome his support and feedback on it.  All of my colleagues know entrepreneurship and SMEs, so the Minister of State and I are talking to people who know what this is all about. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#QQ00300","speaker":"1431"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I will start by acknowledging the immense work of Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who has talked to me about this project on a number of occasions, of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, and of the other committee members present with regard to this report.  I say in jest that it is very easy to see the amount of work the Senator and Leas-Chathaoirleach have put in because both are a bit greyer today than they are in their pictures in the report, which were taken before they started.  Joking aside, a real mountain of work has gone into this.  Today is the first time I have had a really good look at it.  I will digest the figures further over the coming days.  It is a super body of work which brings many facts and figures together in one place.  It is a credit to the committee, as are their recommendations.<\/p> <p>To come back in where the Minister of State left off, it is said that half of the kids born today will work in jobs that have not yet been invented.

Leading on from there, as Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has said, education is the most important thing.  Our schools and colleges have to be able to shift and change course very rapidly.  They really have to work hand in hand with small, and indeed large, businesses.  If they do not, these jobs will not come about.<\/p> <p>I know there has been a slight ramping up of apprenticeships.  We have talked about this on the floor here a number of times.  There has been a genuine attempt to ramp up the numbers but I feel that people are still caught between a rock and hard place in respect of the apprenticeship schemes.  If a kid who is not school-oriented gets fewer than five honours in the junior certificate, he or she will not qualify for an apprenticeship.  It may not be the best way to assess some of these kids.  Perhaps they should be put into a business, whether in the wet trades, with an electrician, or whatever else, and we can see if they stay the course for a year.  If they are keen to progress, one could look at offering them an apprenticeship at that stage.  The only way to access apprenticeships if one does not have those qualifications or examination results is to spend three years working with a chippy, a carpenter, or whatever else.  That is far too long if we want these kids to progress.  It is something at which we can look further.  There has been work done but we should look at it further.<\/p> <p>Many of us here are from the same background, that of small business and small enterprise.  The helps for people who take a chance, perhaps leaving a State job or something to that effect, to set up a small enterprise are not too convincing.  We have looked at the contributions from the State that people who fail can avail of.  These have changed recently.  Some State help is now available to those who fail, which was not the case heretofore.  Even though that is now the case, there is still no correlation between the money one pays into the tax system and what one gets out of the contributory State pension at the end of the day.  This is not the case if one is a Senator, Minister or State employee.  We really have to look at this if we want to encourage more entrepreneurship and throw down the gauntlet as a small trading nation, which we do.  We are very lucky in that we develop great entrepreneurs.  There is something to be done there.  The maximum contributory State pension is &euro;248 or &euro;250.  That is not good enough for somebody taking a big chance.  If they are going to be successful, employ many people, and pay a hell of a lot of tax, this is the least we can do.  They do get breaks and so on in respect of private pensions but many people start off small and are not thinking that they may have a pot of gold at the end to divert into a pension.  It may never happen.  Even with regard to the State pension, the State cannot lose because it will be taxed anyway.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aidan Davitt:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is something else at which we could certainly look.  There is a certain amount of red tape.  I accept that quite a bit of it comes from the European Union.  There was reference to it the other day when Senators Norris and McDowell were discussing certain banking regulations.  There is a certain amount of red tape which we in Ireland are also quite good at introducing.  I could get into a number of examples, but I will not delay our discussion today.<\/p><p>I have also picked out the issue of the Cabinet Minister which Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has highlighted heavily.  The Minister of State has excelled whenever he has come before the Seanad.  I know that his is the junior position, but the area of small and medium enterprises deserves to be served by a full Minister.  I have no doubt that having such a position would help to attract more jobs to the country.  <\/p><p>I have two final points related to the county from which I come, Westmeath, in which quite a lot of agricultural activity takes place.  I was happy to see the number of small businesses in the county and how highly it rated in some of the graphs included in the report.  With reference to agriculture, Burger King has introduced a non-meat burger.  I am told that in America one quarter of milk sold is non-dairy.  That has happened within a very short timeframe.  We have to work to diversify the agriculture sector.  We have the land required, very skilled farmers and a lot of know-how, but we have to stay ahead.  Senator Coghlan has spoken about the Kerry Group, Dairygold and all of the work great companies such as Origin are doing in producing products, including protein bars and so on.  That is the way forward for us and it is something on which we have to work within the agriculture sector.  We could be doing smarter things in the agriculture industry, rather than talking about sending stuff to the far end of China.  We have very clever guys in the agriculture industry.  With the right help from the enterprise bodies, we could do a little more.<\/p><p>I will throw out a point about the planning matrix.  I have a lot of interest in planning since my time as a councillor.  If one looks at retail units on the main street in any given town, even in Killarney or outside the gates in Dublin but especially in my own town and many others in the midlands, one sees nail bars, hairdressers, coffee shops, fast food outlets, beauty salons and betting shops.  Our main streets are populated only by these cheap service industries which make up much of the small enterprise and industry sector and provide much employment, but most of the jobs are paid poorly.  Can we do better in that regard?  With councils and enterprise bodies, we have to see how we can do better in the retail sector.  We are all aware of Internet retail services and how they have hurt main street retail units, but there is also a big gap in the area, which is something at which we could look, perhaps through the Minister of State's Department.  A little more thinking or stability could help to create more productive jobs and might be of some help to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#QQ00600","speaker":"1411","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, and acknowledge his enormous track record in the few years he has been Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  I thank, in particular, the rapporteur for the committee, my colleague, Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach who is its Chairman.  It is a really important piece of work.  As I was listening to Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, I was thinking about how we were all small business people.  We are involved in enterprise and are like entrepreneurs.  I like to keep my language simple.  Irish people innately like to make a few bob.  We like the challenge of doing something.  At the age of 11 years, I kept angora rabbits and sold angora wool.  I sent it through the post and was sent back a postal order which I had difficulty cashing.  If we bought a bag of sweets for a shilling as little kids, we would cut it open and sell them for a penny each to make a few bob.  That is something that is innate to Irish people's psyche.  We are dealers.  My father was a cattle dealer and I inherited some of his guile and determination, or whatever else one might call it, which drove me to turn a buck and make a bob.  I believe it is something all Irish people have.  We talk about SMEs and enterprise, but I like to keep it simple.  We all like to provide and put a loaf on the table.  We realise business is essential in that regard.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge, in particular, Senators Coghlan, &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, Ardagh, Buttimer, Byrne, Conway, Mark Daly, Devine, Freeman and Kelleher who make up the committee.  The report is a really important piece of work.  I will focus in on it but will not take long.  It is 186 pages long and includes 129 recommendations.  One of the things I really like about the report of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on small and medium enterprises in Ireland is that it sets out and talks about our key successes.  It acknowledges them, which is really positive.  It is not all negative or downbeat but acknowledges our key successes.  It also acknowledges and sets out the key challenges we face.  It is particularly interesting to see how they were built into the report, which is important.  More importantly, it includes 129 recommendations.  If the report is to have any meaning and not to gather dust like so many others in the Houses of the Oireachtas and Departments, we need to do something about it.  <\/p> <p>One of the other things I like about the report is the quality of the data.  That is what gives it integrity and meaning.  I have looked through it and the data and evidence are included.  I was taken particularly by the summary of the top four industries in each county, based on the percentage of people engaged in each industry.  That is a really powerful infographic included in the report.  It confirms everything Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh has said about there being different horses for different courses.  What works in Dublin might not work elsewhere in Leinster, Munster or different parts of the country.  That is an important point.  <\/p> <p>The report is a great body of work, but it has to have meaning.  We need to see its recommendations tracked and a timeline for their delivery.  Not everything will happen today or tomorrow.  We need to put in place regular reviews of the report to see if it is being implemented.  Implementation will be slow, but it is important that the report be implemented and that its implementation be tracked.  I know that the Minister of State will agree.<\/p> <p>I was particularly impressed by the report's focus on certain issues, one of which I will single out - the farming and agrifood sector.  There is an enormous number of small enterprises involved in the production of artisan foods, from mustard to jam to chutney.  The country market scene has really grown in Ireland.  It is now a popular leisure activity to visit a country market at the weekend.  While we have great companies like the Kerry Group at one level, there are loads of little family run niche businesses at another.  If a little business just keeps one household going, it is really good.  There is a real need to go back to producing holistic and organic products which are home-produced.  We are brilliant at it.  It is a matter of bringing artisan craft food companies to a higher level.  Some of the big companies started in this way.  Big oak trees come from small acorns.  Businesses have to start somewhere and then grow.  If they are nurtured, they will grow.  That is a really important point.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the report's emphasis on farming and, particularly, fisheries.  This is an island and the potential of the fisheries sector is enormous, but we have to add value to fish products.  We could produce fish-meal, but there are many other things that could be done in the fisheries industry.  This ties in with the development of the hospitality and tourism sectors, on which the report also places great emphasis.  I was particularly impressed by the focus on innovation and collaboration.  These are two key and important words which are central to the tenor of the report.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They are particularly good.  I want to acknowledge the importance of the data, demographics, research and information in the report.<\/p><p>In his speech the Minister of State said that on 4 October 2019, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced 16 LEO projects, which is excellent.  He also referenced the LEO productivity challenge fund, which totals &euro;500,000.  It is not enough.  I know times are tough and it is hard to get money, but only 2,500 vouchers are required.  It is not a lot of money overall.  People should not have to jump through hoops to secure funding.  I know the Minister would like to do more and that resources do not allow us to do more, but I would like that to be under constant review.<\/p><p>I am appealing to the Minister of State, his Government colleagues and everybody here.  If we are to address the challenges of small and medium business, impediments to local enterprise and give help to the shopkeepers, shoemakers, sweetshops and newsagents which keep our villages and towns thriving, we have to examine how we are funding local government.  The reliance on funding the core day-to-day activities of our 31 local authorities through local businesses is grossly unfair.  <\/p><p>The property tax was introduced with great promises.  People may recall the leaflets, fanfare and publicity around the local property tax and it was said every citizen was going to make a contribution, and rightly so.  I am not against the local property tax, rather, I am against the current mechanism and the fact it does not take into account anyone's ability to pay.  I understand the Government is examining reform of the local property tax, which I welcome.  <\/p><p>I do not think it is right and proper that businesses are propping up the funding of local authorities.  I am aware that some councillors, who have spoken to me, are striking rates today.  Businesses are up in arms because shopkeepers and businesses are always the soft target.  I understand the difficulties faced by local government, but the best thing we could do over the next number of years is reform how we fund local government and remove the burden and over-reliance on commercial rates to support it from the backs and shoulders of small, medium and large enterprises and entrepreneurs. <\/p><p>If we are to ensure things go further, we have to put in place a tracking and delivery mechanism and ensure there is a constant review of the objectives of this report.  Well done to all involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#RR00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I welcome this report.  It is the second time we have discussed it in the House.  I want to speak from a personal perspective.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh made reference to being self-employed.  I established myself as a self-employed chartered accountant many years ago and was self-employed for about 12 years before I went into politics.  SMEs, in particular startups, were my bread and butter.  There is no substitute for experience.<\/p> <p>There are a couple of things in the report which I welcome and a number of others to which I would make an addition.  It is important that the report was done.  It is important that we have someone like the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, with specific responsibility for SMEs.  <\/p> <p>I want to look at Brexit in a positive, rather than a negative, light.  I see it as a wake-up call for us on several levels.  We have been over reliant on the UK market for many decades.  We have to give SMEs the scope to go into other markets, and that is happening through Enterprise Ireland.  In terms of Brexit, we must ensure that whatever supports are required to enable the SME sector to reposition are available.  This is particularly important for the indigenous and agricultural sectors, which have a disproportionate reliance on the UK market.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will be aware of the importance of artificial intelligence.  Companies which were set up by young people living in Limerick, Clare and the mid west have become multinationals.  We need to promote a model whereby we are outward rather than inward looking.  Multinationals coming to Ireland are great, but we have to provide an environment where young, vibrant men and women in Ireland can establish businesses, the markets for which are not just Ireland, although that is extremely important, but Asia, Europe and Britain. <\/p> <p>People should not be afraid of failure.  People in America set up businesses which fail.  Many successful businesspeople have failed two or three times.  In Ireland people are still worried that if they set up a business they may fail.  People should be encouraged to set up businesses because they learn from experience.  When one is self-employed, there is no substitute for putting money into a bank account or seeing that an overdraft has gone over the limit.  The late Albert Reynolds was quoted as saying that when the peace process was ongoing he was told that the pressure must be horrific, but he said pressure was going out on a Friday night knowing that if he did not collect &pound;10,000 in all of his dance halls and lodge the money in the bank on a Monday morning he would be out of business. <\/p> <p>In the early years of my business I was not paid by certain clients.  I remember going out for three or four hours on a winter's evening to wait for a client to come back so that I could collect my money.  I had a young family.  We have to create an environment where people are not afraid to fail and we support SMEs.<\/p> <p>That self-employed people are now eligible for jobseeker's benefit is a small but significant and positive change.  Payments for the self-employed who become ill is another small but significant change.  <\/p> <p>The largest employers in the country are SMEs.  Multinationals are fantastic and there are many in our region, which I welcome.  However, SMEs are major employers and have a significant status in small towns and villages for myriad reasons.  They enable people to rear their families nearby, support local shops and pubs and keep post offices open.  We have to look at SMEs in a wider context and ask what we can do to support those being established in rural villages, towns and suburbs.<\/p> <p>This report is extremely important, and it is now important that it is acted on in a timely manner.  We will not get everything right.  Having been self employed for many years, I learned that it is tough and banks are extremely important.  They are not the only essential ingredient, but having access to cash is critical.  Many of my clients over the years could not get overdraft facilities.  Instead, they got drafts at the start of the month from the local credit union and lodged them to their current accounts so that they could function.  That is why I always stand up for the credit union movement.  It has started to evolve and needs to get into public banking.  One option is the Canadian model, where credit unions have back-office facilities.  Credit unions need to take on the banks.  <\/p> <p>We need to ensure that the State spends money wisely on behalf of taxpayers in supporting SMEs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Second, we need to ensure that the State spends money wisely on behalf of the taxpayer in supporting SMEs.  I want to see that if somebody wants to have a cut and fail, they should not be penalised to the extent that in many ways they are, both in reputation and in how they are sometimes recognised by banks.  This is a feature of being an entrepreneur.<\/p><p>Third, with Brexit, we need to foster an environment where we take up the challenge.  I see no positive aspect to Brexit and I am hoping that it will not happen.  It is a wake-up call, however, to tell us that we need to diversify more and more, particularly with the SME sector in the non-UK market, even though the UK market is hugely important.<\/p><p>I want to see the continuation of an environment being fostered where our entrepreneurs go into the multinational sector but are based in Ireland.  I see many of these  entrepreneurs going abroad and being based in America.  This should not be happening.  I would like to see them based in Ireland.  I would like to have seen the Collison brothers being based in Limerick.  People will have personal reasons for their views.  I would like to see a situation where we are doing business in such a way that entrepreneurs from abroad will come into Ireland.  There is so much going for us here and what we have in Ireland is a natural entrepreneurial streak.  It is a little bit wild and outside the box, which many of us are.  It is endemic in the Irish psyche.  I very much welcome this support.  It needs to be acted upon and we need to continue to create this kind of environment.<\/p><p>The real dimension is what can we do to get SMEs to set up in their own localities, to employ local people and to suddenly see these blossoming into great multinational companies.  We have many examples throughout the country.  Fexco is one below in Kerry.  We have H&amp;MV Engineering, which the Taoiseach came down to open in Limerick, and companies like ActionPoint and multitudes of others.  I want to see that approach being developed and these companies being recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#SS00200","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I was not sure if I was the only Dub here, but no, we have a blow-in as well.

It has all become very much the same.  There is great excitement when one visits the sticks and finds different crafts and foods, which speak of who we are.  Unfortunately, big cities tend to become very bland offering something that one will pick up worldwide.  It is the SME that is unique and different.<\/p> <p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee has shown itself, under the tutelage and steerage of our esteemed Chairman, to be an invaluable committee in the past two years.  We have proudly covered topics ranging from children's mental health to Travellers' rights.  The Citizens' Assembly process has been well-documented and respected in recent times for the positive contribution it makes to our democracy, and I believe the Seanad Public Consultation Committee operates in a similar vein.  We  invite in the experts and the stakeholders, the people on the ground, and we explore, based on the scientific evidence, what is needed, the data required, and what are the problems and solutions.  I look forward to the committee undertaking my own chosen topic; hopefully, we will produce a similarly comprehensive and detailed report and recommendations as was done with this fantastic report we are discussing here today. <\/p> <p>On that note, I welcome the chance to speak and I commend Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on bringing this topic to the committee.  I was present during the consultation and it was a very comprehensive and enjoyable listen for me.  I learned a great deal. <\/p> <p>As this report indicates, it is going to take some big and creative ideas to support the growth of SMEs in Ireland, especially within the context of political uncertainty, climate change, and Brexit. <\/p> <p>As the engine of the Irish economy, SMEs need a strong State agency advocating for them and providing support to sustain and grow our indigenous enterprise sector.  This report recommends that we promote and encourage collaboration, cohesion and communication among the various organisations and bodies delivering supports and initiatives to SMEs.  <\/p> <p>In Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget we proposed the establishment of a new Irish enterprise agency to assist domestic SMEs.  This organisation would provide the Government with advice and guidance on what SMEs, retailers and other enterprises want.  This agency would ensure that the uptake of State supports and assistance being provided is of an equal standard and quality across the State.  <\/p> <p>We need to tackle some of the unfair cost of doing business.  One such cost, as spoken about earlier, is in the area of insurance, and Deputy Pearse Doherty has taken a huge lead on this.  These costs have become extortionate, ripping off consumers and closing down businesses.  Our plan for insurance reform would stamp out fraud, protect consumers, ban price discrimination by the industry and reduce premiums for everyone. <\/p> <p>To do this we need to set up a Garda insurance fraud unit, ban dual pricing by the insurance industry, enact and pass the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, abolish premium levies and put &euro;230 million back in consumers' pockets, with State intervention to address the market failure.  These measures would ensure fairer insurance premiums for small businesses and stop the rip-off of small businesses by big companies. <\/p> <p>This report also makes 129 recommendations, some of which are around fostering female entrepreneurship.  In Ireland, women are less likely to be entrepreneurs than men.   Some 65% of new business owners are men, 35% are female.  Of particular concern, also, is the fact that men and women differ in the terms of their attitudes and perceptions to entrepreneurship.  A higher proportion of male adults in the total population, 52%, believe they have skills and knowledge to start up a new enterprise, compared to female adults at only 33%.  In 2013, a higher proportion of men than women reported that they believed they had access to training on how to start or grow a business.  <\/p> <p>This seems to be a general phenomenon.  In politics, men are often far more self-assured and self-confident than women.  The National Women's Council of Ireland and Women for Election came up with the same idea, and asked whether it is how we are socialised as we grow up.  Women are a lot more modest than men, and perhaps a bit more shy as well.  What were those barriers?  Many of these barriers are socialisation, how we are nurtured and reared, our culture, and our ties to home with children, and such issues.  Sin sc&eacute;al eile for another day.  It is certainly stark when it comes to businesses and almost every other area of life.<\/p> <p>Some 43% of females cite a fear of failure as stopping them in business compared with 36% of men.  Some 25% of females have a role model through knowing a recent entrepreneur where 35% of men do.  Further research shows that Ireland has a particularly big disparity between the proportion of men and women in the population who declare they have access to money to start or grow a business.  <\/p> <p>It is comforting to know that, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach noted, 8% of first-time start-ups six years ago were by women whereas last year this had climbed to 28%.  There is hope for us yet.<\/p> <p>Lack of female participation is bad for business, which we know.  The point was also made during the consultation about apprenticeships, referenced a little earlier.  There is a push to encourage more women to take these up, but the value of apprenticeships needs to be acknowledged and respected.  It really goes against the grain for me that every child should have an automatic rite of passage to university and that this is somehow the be-all and end-all of their maturity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We know children sometimes have no interest in university but they still go because it is a bit of a doss.  I did it myself quite a lot.  Apprenticeships need to be valued and respected and we need to get women involved in them.  They are of equal value and they provide the practical, hands-on skills we will need.<\/p><p>The recommendations have invaluable ideas on the overall development of SME but I want to elaborate on two other ideas.  We need an increase in the research and development tax credit to 30% for SMEs to help to promote innovation and creativity within our economy.  We want diverse and novel thinking, collaboration and Ireland as a leader.  A bit more focus on the creation of workers' co-operative development units to promote workers' co-operatives in Ireland would be helpful.  Ownership must be shared for society to have a fair and functioning economy that works for workers and for our communities, .<\/p><p>I caution that we prepare SMEs for a just transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  In our climate action mission, we will all have to make serious changes, but we have acknowledged we should not leave anybody behind without support, and that includes SMEs.  I welcome this report to the House and commend the work of the committee.  There is much we can do to promote this from tackling insurance rip-offs to promoting female entrepreneurship.  We need to remember and fully appreciate - to repeat what the Leas-Chathaoirleach said - that family enterprises have more attachment and gr&aacute; for their communities and their employees.  I welcome the 129 recommendations and, hopefully, the Minister of State and future Ministers and Ministers of State will have those recommendations embedded in future policies to support, enable and assist small businesses.

A lack of access to finance is a problem for small companies and we know cash flow is the lifeblood of many companies.<\/p> <p>I want to resolve one matter in particular.  When the recession happened, most people were in businesses and those business are not fit for purpose now.  Retail has changed, for example, but new businesses and companies are embedded in our local communities.  People do not fully realise that many of those businesses bought bank shares for their pensions.  Most people in the public service, such as ourselves, have a pension but most people in businesses did not have a pension plan and they bought bank shares in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Those bank shares were their lump sum and dividend.  That is one thing most people do not understand.  Those people ended up with nothing.  I know most of my friends who were in business - and perhaps the businesses were not fit for purpose - ended up with nothing.  I had a shop that I kept going for as long as I could and the only reason it closed is that I ran out of money.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell summed it up perfectly.  There was an honesty and a loyalty involved in keeping businesses going.  Those people were let down by the State because there was nothing there for them.  I am delighted we now have some support for self-employed people through the social protection system.  I am watching what is happening.

I will inquire into the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta funding for the LEOs for Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  That is well noted.<\/p> <p>I noted the comments of Senators Devine and Davitt on apprenticeships.  Apprenticeships are important.  Thankfully, we are gone from the days when mothers and fathers felt that all their sons and daughters should get academic degrees in universities.  There is much more value in high-end apprenticeships or whatever type of apprenticeship one undertakes.  Many multinational and indigenous companies prefer to have a worker train with them on an apprenticeship.  That person often turns out to a good quality worker.<\/p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell mentioned the important of trade missions in diversification.  That is very much part of the Department's policy with Enterprise Ireland this year.  We have sought to diversify into other markets, such as the eurozone, which is strategically important for us.  One time, language was a barrier in those areas but that is no longer an issue.  I am always proud to travel abroad with Irish companies on trade missions, particularly with SMEs.  I know Senator Devine will not mind me saying many of these are located outside of the greater Dublin area, particularly in the medical technology sector, and they can stand up to any of these big multinational companies, work with them, partner with them and sub-supply them, etc.  I am proud of those companies.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the agrifood sector, which is so important to us.  He is correct about the supplementary income for jam makers, sausage makers and cheesemakers.  All these play an important role in showcasing Ireland in artisan food, particularly in contributing to the significant tourism business we have in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell is correct we should reward people who take risks.  That is important.<\/p> <p>To respond to Senator Feighan's contribution, access to finance is important and it is something we are conscious of for SMEs and small businesses.  That is why Microfinance Ireland has played a significant role.<\/p> <p>I thank all Senators who made a contribution.  It was a valuable exercise.  I am glad we had these constructive statements.  It is clear we have a shared appreciation of the fundamental role SMEs play in our economy, not only from the business sense but from a social perspective as well.  Senator Devine was born in the Liberties and now represents Tallaght but she knows the importance of SMEs in Dublin as well.  They are just as important in those sectors all over Dublin.  I have visited them and have seen the important role microenterprises play in Dublin, including in the community context.  SMEs are the fabric of the daily life of every village, town and region in the country.  Even before we go into the central role of developing the strength and resilience of our economy, our SMEs are also the facilitators of the fabric of life so that people throughout the country can provide immediate employment opportunities closest to the people in their homes and communities.  One finds that communities build when there are small microenterprises there.  That helps families to avoid commuting, which prevents pollution and helps with our climate obligations.<\/p> <p>On the basis of the contributions, I am reassured we have a shared understanding of the many leading priorities that should be pursued by Government by seeking to develop and strengthen the SME sector across Ireland.  These priorities have been reflected in the excellent report carried out by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, in the OECD review, which was launched last week, and in the contributions we have heard this afternoon.<\/p> <p>To recap, we must ensure our forthcoming SME and entrepreneurship strategy addresses all the crucial aspects, including ensuring we have the appropriate targets and support programmes for SMEs to foster the conditions whereby SMEs can innovate, pursue new and emerging technologies, including digitalisation; develop the skills of the owners and managers of SMEs because it is important they have the requisite skills such as the management of finance; create regional ecosystems based on the development of excellence, which will include clusters and hubs that are enterprise-led and; facilitate collaborations.<\/p> <p>A few Senators, including Senator Boyhan, mentioned the importance of female entrepreneurship.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Pat Breen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1766\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1766&amp;amp;pid=PatBreen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important that we put in place and grow female entrepreneurship.

Since I was last here we have witnessed some important and positive developments in the Brexit process.  On 17 October, the European Union and United Kingdom agreed a revised withdrawal agreement and political declaration on future EU-UK relationship.  As I have said before in this House, we were content with the agreement both sides reached in November 2018.  However, we needed to find another agreement with the current British Prime Minister.<\/p> <p>We have always understood that a Brexit solution would require compromise.  When the earlier deal failed to pass through the UK Parliament the new UK Government sought a different solution.  In a spirit of compromise the EU engaged once again.  While Ireland supported this renewed engagement, our approach remained firm and consistent.  Any revised agreement must meet our core objectives, including protecting the Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Customs Union and Ireland's place in them.  Our partners in the EU understood and supported this approach.  Michel Barnier and the task force remained committed to finding a deal that worked for all sides, including Northern Ireland, Ireland, the EU and the UK.  We worked closely with them and, when appropriate, engaged directly with the UK as well.<\/p> <p>The new agreement has been reached after much discussion, compromise and flexibility.  We welcome it as it meets our core objectives and those of the EU.  It preserves much of the original agreement.  It secures transition, protects the rights of EU and UK citizens and provides for a fair financial settlement.  It gives certainty to citizens and businesses and allows us all to move on and develop a new and, hopefully, strong relationship with the UK post-Brexit.  It upholds measures to maintain the common travel area and continued North-South co-operation.  It maintains commitments to ensure no diminution of rights and safeguards equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  It confirms that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens.<\/p> <p>The revised protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland sees the backstop provisions replaced with new Northern Ireland-specific arrangements.  These provide a legally operable solution as well as certainty that at the end of the transition period the benefits of the peace process can continue to be enjoyed by all.  This has been a priority for the Government and our EU partners throughout the negotiations.  Equally, business leaders and representative organisations in Northern Ireland have been clear about the need to ensure that arrangements protect the gains of the past 21 years and promote economic stability and progress.  Customs and VAT provisions mean that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK customs territory but continue to apply the rules of the Union Customs Code.  EU customs duties will apply to goods entering Northern Ireland if those goods are at risk of entering the EU Single Market.  No customs duties will be payable, however, if the goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK are not at risk of entering the EU Single Market.<\/p> <p>Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of EU rules, notably all rules related to goods to ensure there is no need for border checks.  This avoids any customs or regulatory checks or controls on the island of Ireland.  Northern Ireland will be able to benefit from any free trade arrangements the UK signs and will also have access to the Single Market.  This unique opportunity allows Northern Irish companies to produce goods for the UK or EU markets.  Some of the practical detail will be further clarified during the transition period by the EU and the UK working together in what is called the joint committee.<\/p> <p>Unlike the backstop, which was envisioned as temporary insurance policy, the new arrangements could have a more enduring nature.  In other words, they could end up being permanent if people want to keep them in place.  However, no one wants to see Northern Ireland remaining in these arrangements if it does not want to.  Therefore, a role is provided for a majority of Northern Ireland's elected MLAs to decide if the arrangements are to be maintained in future.  Some have asked if parallel consent from unionist and nationalist representatives is needed along the lines it is applied elsewhere to key decisions in the Assembly on devolved matters.  However, international treaties and international relations are not devolved matters.  They are excepted matters which fall under the competence of the UK Government and not the Northern Ireland Executive or Assembly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Equally, it is important no outcome provides one side or the other with a practical veto.  That risks paralysis and there being no solution at all; therefore, the process envisaged in the protocol ensures neither unionism nor nationalism will have a controlling vote, veto or an effective block.  The vote of each and every individual MLA and the views of his or her constituents are of equal weight and importance.  The UK Government has also given a commitment that before the vote, there will be proper consultation with business and civil society.  It should be based on the lived reality and experience of businesses, farmers and citizens, not a proxy for any other issue.<\/p><p>Ratification of the agreement by both the European and British Parliaments will be the green light for the beginning of negotiations on what I hope will be a broad, deep and flexible partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom, a partnership centred on an ambitious and balanced free trade agreement.  The European Union has indicated that it is ready to open negotiations immediately after ratification and created a new task force for relations with the United Kingdom under the leadership of Michel Barnier.  The timeline for completion of negotiations is very ambitious as the transition period lasts until the end of 2020.  It may be extended once by one or two years if both sides agree and a decision on an extension is needed by 1 July 2020, but that does not give us much time.  As Michel Barnier said, the negotiations will be \"demanding and difficult\", as the Brexit negotiations have been to date.  <\/p><p>As the talks will cover a range of issues of importance to Ireland, it will be vital to continue to ensure our priorities and core principles are appropriately reflected.  This will require a whole-of-government effort underpinned by the same coherent, cohesive approach that has characterised our Brexit strategy from the start.  Work is under way to identify and elaborate on our priorities, but our approach will remain consistent.  We want to see the closest possible relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, while also ensuring adequate level playing field provisions to facilitate fair competition.  During this process we will build on our strong relations with the task force and the Commission.  We will also continue to engage with Members of the Oireachtas, domestic stakeholders and member states, as I hope we have done appropriately in recent years and months.  Substantial work will also be required during the transition period to finalise a range of  sensitive issues arising from implementation of the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement.  <\/p><p>While the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was averted, it remains a possibility for 31 January 2020 unless the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the United Kingdom and the European Union.  As long as a no-deal exit is a possibility, we must be prudent.  The intensive work carried out already can be banked for future use, while the additional time available can be used to add to or refine our response measures.  We will continue to prioritise certain key issues in the period ahead.  It is also important to take into account that some of the no-deal preparedness measures in place may also be relevant if and when a future relations agreement enters into force.<\/p><p>Brexit, whatever form it takes, means significant change for the people of this island.  As we move, I hope, from ratifying and implementing the withdrawal agreement to negotiations on future EU-UK relations, managing Brexit will remain a priority for the foreseeable future.  We are determined to rebuild, strengthen and energise relationships, North-South and east-west, for the benefit of all businesses and all of the people.  The Government will ensure the intensive work will continue to prepare Ireland for all possible outcomes and make sure we are best placed to advance Ireland's interests in the next phase of Brexit which I hope will happen in the not too distant future.  I look forward to Members' comments and questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#VV01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister is glad to have something of a break.  I am also sure he is not resting on his laurels, but at least he has a break from the frenzy of the negotiations that have taken place in the past few months.  <\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the fact that the European Union has agreed to a Brexit extension until 31 January 2020.  There is no point in going back over the farcical situation that obtained at Westminster when MPs acted like characters in a P. G. Wodehouse comic novel.  Because of the volatility of that parliament, even when it comes back in a new form, nobody can take it for granted that we will have a deal.  Clearly, the Government, businesses, farmers, importers and exporters must continue to prepare for all eventualities.  It would be very foolish for us to take anything for granted at this stage.<\/p><p>Irrespective of the outcome of the UK general election, priority must be given to filling the political vacuum in the North because, as the Minister outlined in his statement, a good deal of the proposed agreement is contingent on the Assembly being in place to enable MLAs to comment on the continuance or otherwise of the agreement.  To a certain extent, we are building on sand until such time as politicians in all parties in the North decide that the Assembly is worth the candle after all of the violence and everything else we witnessed during the decades.  We marked the anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, yet for the past three years the Assembly has been useless.  I note that the Independent Reporting Commission has recently stated the continuing uncertainty <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Assembly is increasing the risk of a return to paramilitary violence, something nobody in these Houses wants to see.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the British and Irish Governments as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement to redouble their efforts to secure some movement on the Assembly.  The Independent Reporting Commission has also highlighted the increase in the number of violent deaths and attacks of a paramilitary nature.  Everyone witnessed the horror of what happened in counties Cavan and Fermanagh in the case of Quinn Industrial Holdings.  The situation is volatile and we cannot underestimate the dangers.  I know that I am at variance with other Members of the House and possibly with members of my own party when I say this, but I do not understand why people are calling for a Border poll at this time.  I do not see the logic in it.  I hope that in the future, possibly the not too distant future, when circumstances touch on being normal in Northern Ireland, a Border poll will take place in a calm atmosphere, but at the moment it would be nothing short of a sectarian head count which would exacerbate emotions.  As long as Northern Ireland remains an unreal political entity, there should not be such a poll.  I hope the Minister will agree with me.  <\/p><p>Another issue that concerns me is the relationship between this country and Great Britain at this time.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Naturally, where we were involved in a situation that was to a certain extent confrontational, we were not, to say the least, singing from the one hymn sheet.  Tensions grew, fuelled, of course, by media and ill-advised comment from the hurlers on the ditch.  It is fair to say that relationships between the British community and this community are not at a high level at present.  Certainly, they have fallen a long way from the great relationship we had when the late Albert Reynolds and John Major, or Bertie Ahern and Tony Blair, had an understanding which led to the Good Friday Agreement.  That was a high point in our relationships and we all thought that the past was over and that kind of enmity of \"the ol' enemy\" was something that we could put aside.  I am afraid it is there.  I sense it is very much there in certain sectors of the British community.  That hostility towards us has surfaced, certainly in some of the less-responsible interviews that we have heard.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il, under its leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, will continue to act in the national interest as long as Brexit is in question.  It was not easy for my party to undertake, and to commit to, the confidence and supply agreement.  We had critics everywhere, including from within, but we have stood up.  We went into a relationship with the present Government to create stability at a time when other parties which had the same opportunity ran away.  They did not want to know about Government.  They did not want to know about responsibilities.  They could not wait for Fianna F&aacute;il to underpin the Government so that they could go straight into their default mode of opposition.  Maybe when there is another general election things will have changed.  However, we did not abdicate our responsibility that time and the country appreciates that.  I am sure the Government, despite all the sparing that naturally goes on between the two main parties in Ireland, deep down knows that it would not have been able to achieve anything of the sort with Brexit if Fianna F&aacute;il had not been on side.<\/p><p>The UK general election on 12 December is entirely a matter for it and I will not anticipate the outcome.  Hopefully, the result will provide clarity and a pathway forward because continued uncertainty, as we all know, is bad for Ireland.  It is bad for our tourism.  It is bad for our business.  It is bad for consumer confidence.<\/p><p>The withdrawal deal, as outlined by the Minister, is acceptable.  It is not as good as the deal that was negotiated with the former British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, but, nonetheless, the back stop has been replaced with this rolling consent mechanism.  It is new.  It is untested and, as I said, it is predicated on a Northern Ireland Assembly being functioning, which we cannot be sure of.<\/p><p>In terms of preparation, we still have to keep the no deal in our heads and some of the statistics are distressing and worrying.  Some 58,000 businesses are still without an economic operators registration and identification, EORI, number.  An AIB report states that 41% of SMEs in the Republic and 53% in Northern Ireland have still done no planning whatsoever for Brexit.  According to a recent parliamentary question, 30% of export-import companies have taken no mitigating action to address Brexit problems.  Up to the end of September, only 14% of the &euro;600 million loan fund for Brexit has been sanctioned for bank lending.  This leaves an alarming &euro;514 million in unused Brexit funds.  I could quote Mr. Aidan Flynn, the general manager of the freight transport association, who made a stark statement the other day.  I could go through all that.  I am not a Doomsday merchant.  We are where we are at present.<\/p><p>There is a hiatus.  There will be some clarity when the British general election is over.  We will have to keep pulling and working together for the good of the country.  Whatever way this Brexit turns out, it will be bad but, hopefully, it will be the least worse that it could be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#WW00200","speaker":"1394","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, for his comments on Brexit.  I commend the Government and all the civil servants on the work they have completed so far on this because the one word that resonates through everybody and every business in the land, North or South, is \"uncertainty\", and dealing with uncertainty in business is a problem at present.<\/p> <p>It is important to reference that there has been much focus in the past few weeks and months on the North-South complexity of a land border there but the T&aacute;naiste stressed the point that the east-west relationship, and especially the interdependence of both these islands post-Brexit, whatever that looks like, is equally as important.<\/p> <p>Based on the upcoming elections, we may see change in the current representation in Northern Ireland and we may see the change in the dynamic of the representation we have at Westminster in Northern Ireland.  It is an understatement to say there is a nervousness in all businesses and among all citizens north of the Border.  Businesses, especially in agrifood, are very concerned that they do not know enough detail at present.  Even though the deal will avert a land border, which was a major concern in this House and in the Lower House, the disruption and complexity at the Northern Ireland ports are a concern of businesses with paperwork, with documentation and all the other bits and pieces that will be thrown at them.  As much as we have averted one problem, there is a concern that we could have created another problem at the sea ports.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators, led by the Chair of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom, Senator Richmond, were fortunate to visit Dublin Port this morning.  The work done to date is a credit to all those involved in the management and the port authorities.  They were faced with a number of challenges, such as the size of the site and the uncertainty of what Brexit would look like.  In my opinion, and I am sure the other Senators would echo these comments, they have done a commendable job in dealing with the Brexit implications for them.<\/p> <p>I refer to the work done in respect of the stakeholders and the complexity that has been dealt with.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned that the UK Government north of the Border will consult with politicians and civic society on any potential impact or agreements that there will be post-Brexit.  I would be interested to know what the T&aacute;naiste's feeling is on the civic engagement because there has been some articles in the press this week about civic engagement and civic dialogue.  I have had a bit of engagement with a number of people about civic engagement because sometimes the people are ahead of the politicians on some of these matters.  It will be paramount that we have that dialogue.  Does the T&aacute;naiste envisage formal mechanisms or what does he see as a way of taking that forward because there is a level of uncertainty with this continual reference to taking a position north of the Border that everyone has a say, everyone is represented and everyone is heard?  I would be interest if the T&aacute;naiste could comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#XX00200","speaker":"1439"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am extremely grateful to the T&aacute;naiste, once again, for coming to this House to provide a timely update on what I have said on many occasions is probably the biggest issue facing the State since the Emergency.

We sit here, possibly not in a period of respite, as a Senator pointed out, but in a period of holding a watching brief as, once again, we look to Westminster to see what might happen.<\/p> <p>I commend the Government on its work over the past number of months and its ability, along with European partners, to maintain the key interests as it affects this island facing into the crisis of Brexit and providing, within the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol, a method to make sure that we keep the Border on this island open.  That was very important.  That was done on the back of years of hard work, particularly by the T&aacute;naiste as well as his predecessor, the Taoiseach and various Ministers of State with responsibility for European affairs.<\/p> <p>It is over to Westminster, once again, and over to the United Kingdom and the four nations within, to select their next parliament and select their next Government which will decide where we go.  I just read that Lady Sylvia Hermon is to step down at this general election.  I would like to put on record and pay credit to her often lone voice in the House of Commons over the past few years of representing the real concerns of so many people on this island.  Lady Hermon is a credit to every single person, regardless of what community or political background he or she comes from.<\/p> <p>There is a pause.  While Westminster makes its democratic decision, we wait for what comes next.

Perhaps the electoral arithmetic will throw up something else.  We do not know what that might be and it is not our place to make predictions or recommendations or to get involved at all.  That said, we must be consistent in stressing that there cannot be a return to a hard border on this island and we must work as closely as possible with our friends in the UK to make sure that never comes about.<\/p><p>The withdrawal agreement and the future political declaration that has passed Second Stage in Westminster and been ratified by the European Council does exactly what needs to be done.  As Senator O'Sullivan rightly said, there is no such thing as a good Brexit and this House will never hear me say that.  That being said, the withdrawal agreement lays the groundwork for the least worst Brexit in the circumstances.  Whatever happens in the UK over the coming months, we must make this work.  We must move on and try our best to limit the damage.  We must point out to the unionist community the many possible benefits for Northern Ireland and work with that community.<\/p><p>Beyond Brexit there are massive challenges facing this and future Governments and the wider Irish body politic.  We were a little lax on those challenges prior to the Brexit vote, but if anything, this should serve as a key reminder of the importance of European engagement for this country.  We must make sure that we work with all partners on all issues.  Just because Brexit is one of the biggest issues facing the EU now does not mean that member state solidarity is a given.  We must continuously work at it and work with the EU.  Certainly, we can criticise where criticism is justified, but we must be mindful of the importance of praising the EU when it is deserved.  We must conduct a far more detailed analysis of European legislation at every level and continue our work with other member state governments, political parties and politicians.  It cannot be just a job for the T&aacute;naiste or the Taoiseach to maintain relationships through European Council meetings and so on.  It is the responsibility of the entire Government and the Oireachtas, whether through COSAC, meetings of the Committee on European Union Affairs, or through other engagements, to push constantly for Ireland's objectives.<\/p><p>Brexit also reminds us of the very important responsibility of all parties in this jurisdiction to invest time and effort in the politics of Northern Ireland.  We cannot take the fragile peace or stability for granted.  We must work continuously with politicians, political parties, citizens and groups from all backgrounds.  If anything, we have to intensify that work, which is a big challenge for everyone, regardless of geography.  It can be argued that for the past 20 years we have taken things for granted to some degree, and Brexit serves as a reminder of the dangers of doing so.<\/p><p>We have not pressed the pause button.  One of the worrying issues in the UK at the moment is that while the general election campaign goes on, work on Brexit preparedness has been scaled back.  Advertisements have been pulled and engagements have been lessened.  We in this jurisdiction need to use this time wisely.  Senators Marshall, &Oacute; Donnghaile, Mulherin and I visited Dublin Port this morning to find out about its work on Brexit preparedness.  While that work is advancing, as Senator O'Sullivan pointed out, a lot more can be done.  While I do not necessarily agree with all of the statistics cited because some may be out of date, we must continuously work on our preparedness.  I know that the T&aacute;naiste and his officials will keep up this work, but just because the UK is having a general election does not mean that the Irish body politic and Irish society can step back from Brexit.  If anything, now is the time to intensify our engagement, work and preparations.  So much of the preparatory work being undertaken by Irish society, particularly by the business and agrifood communities, is just good to do and is not necessarily solely about Brexit.

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and thank him again for his ongoing and continued engagement with this House, which has been consistent throughout the course of the Brexit era.  One of the great positives, as the T&aacute;naiste knows, has been the coming together of Members in this Oireachtas around Brexit.  While we have had differences of opinion and different views on issues, tactics and approaches, our greatest strength has been our unity of purpose in defending the peace process and the hard-won Good Friday Agreement and in ensuring no return to a hard border on the island.<\/p> <p>This is also a political forum, so I am not naive enough to think that people will not make political points, but there has been a marked change in the Fianna F&aacute;il tone and approach in this House over recent Brexit statements.  What we have heard is a single, transferable speech about the North.  It is a very confined speech.  I do not want to use the word \"ignorant\", but it is at least a very narrow view of the political and social realities there.  We have heard how wonderful Fianna F&aacute;il has been in the context of the Brexit negotiations despite it being the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, their officials, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, MEPs in Europe, of which Fianna F&aacute;il had none until recently, and political parties and figures in the North, from which Fianna F&aacute;il abstains, who have done the work.<\/p> <p>I do not think in the current climate that Members in this House should be referring to a core component of the Good Friday Agreement as a sectarian headcount.  A Border poll would be an exercise in democratic expression that people are entitled to advocate for and engage on.  It is what we all voted for and endorsed on this island, North and South, when we voted overwhelmingly for the Good Friday Agreement.  When we talk about defending and upholding the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts in the context of Brexit and if we are truly serious about that, then we must also uphold and defend that aspect of the agreement.  I am amazed that the republican party would refer to an exercise in democratic expression, a right of people here to self-determination, as a sectarian headcount.  Senator Marshall comes from a completely different political and ideological background and tradition than me and most of the people in this institution.  That gives us a great strength and brings a great wealth to the Oireachtas, but Senator Marshall, coming from the perspective that he comes from, does not say that we should not have this conversation and nor do an increasing number of people like him.  They are up for having this conversation.  They do not want the same outcome but they are not running away or trying to shut down an engagement in democratic expression.  I wanted to make that important point for the record.<\/p> <p>We welcome and support the Brexit deal as it has been secured and do so in the clear knowledge that there is no good Brexit deal.  Brexit is being forced upon the people of Ireland, just as partition was forced upon the people, and in both instances it was against our expressed welfare and wishes.  I also commend the EU and the Government, parties in the Oireachtas and my own colleagues in Europe, our MEP team and not least, my own MEP, whom I am in danger of losing, Ms Martin Anderson, on their combined efforts over the past three years, which have produced the latest deal.  The agreement makes it clear that there will not be a hard border in Ireland or a unionist veto over the planned protections against Brexit.  Attempts by the DUP, in particular, to exercise a veto over matters not related to the Good Friday Agreement will not happen.  The Good Friday Agreement does need protecting from this deal because it is under no threat from it.  Brexit is not a devolved matter.  The protections in the deal will be codified in international law, which is very important.  It is particularly important when the failure of the British Government to codify in law the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement is considered.  We can see the consequences of that failure in the Emma DeSouza case.  I am looking forward to meeting the T&aacute;naiste, along with other parties in the North, to discuss that case soon.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has supported the Irish Government and the EU throughout the past three years of negotiations.  We were the first to argue for a designated special status for the North within the EU, and we gained support for that approach with our motion in the Lower House last year.  The past three years have shown clearly that when it comes to the people of Ireland, North and South, the parties at Westminster do not care.  It is Britain's interests first or, more precisely, England's interests first.  The interests of the people of Ireland will never and can never be taken seriously at Westminster.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senator O'Sullivan rightly said, Westminster is a parliament in chaos, which is the problem.  Ireland and all the parties working together to minimise the damage of Brexit are the solution.  The Government and the parties opposed to Brexit will need to be ever alert beyond the period we are dealing with and especially during the period when negotiations take place on a trade deal between the EU and the British Government.  We wish the Government well in that regard.  Further to what I have said about the issue of the North, another point on which I respectfully disagree with colleagues is where Senator O'Sullivan argued for the North to become normal.  Normalisation was tried in the North but it failed because partition is not normal.  It is an anomaly.  It is because of partition and the union with Britain that we face this devastation, economic threat and the threat to our peace and progress.<\/p><p>In welcoming the deal, I again wish the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues well in their endeavours and work over what will be an intensely important period.  There is nothing like negotiations over Christmas, but I know they will knuckle down.  They will have an engaged and willing, albeit critical when necessary, partner in Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#YY00200","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and compliment him and his team on the great work they have done over the past three and a half years.  Any time I visit Westminster and my British colleagues ask me what I think of Brexit, I always say we view Brexit as the British accidentally shooting themselves, but in our foot.  It is a difficult situation.  Somebody referred to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, giving the subject of history special status in the junior cycle.  It would be worthwhile for some MPs at Westminster to read up on Irish history and its complications.  Nevertheless, that does not represent the vast majority of British MPs and Lords, who understand the complications of Brexit.  Moreover, there is a generosity towards the island of Ireland, which I greatly appreciate.  Similarly, in this House and the other, there is a generosity towards Westminster.  We have come an awfully long way since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement, and we are in a much better space.<\/p> <p>We have very good friends at Westminster.  There are Lord Dubs and Conor McGinn, and I note that in the past half an hour Lady Sylvia Hermon has announced she will not seek re-election.  We need people such as Lady Hermon in the constituency of North Down, who was a voice of reason.  I hope that whoever takes the seat will be as balanced and measured as she has been since she became an MP in 2001.  That such people will not stand is not a good sign.  While it is a unionist or Alliance seat - certainly not a nationalist seat - I hope that whoever takes it will look out for the island of Ireland.  While Lady Hermon fights her corner and believes in the union, given that is her background, she has always been open, measured, reasonable and understanding of different points of view, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>As I have noted in the few times I have visited Westminster, we work closely with our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues there, who do not take their seats, which is fine.  The three SDLP MPs, namely, Alasdair McDonnell, Mark Durkan and Margaret Ritchie, work closely with us, along with the two Ulster Unionist Party MPs, namely, Tom Elliott and Danny Kinahan, and the Sinn F&eacute;in MPs.  We work closely together to try to articulate a view from Ireland.  I wish Ms Ritchie every success in the House of Lords.  People attacked her on Twitter but hers is a measured voice we need.  She was previously the leader of the SDLP.  I wish her every success.  It is a bit like our two colleagues in the House, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, from one background, and Senator Marshall, from another.  They bring a voice from the North from two sides of the equation.  It is welcome and it informs us of the nuances of the North and the wider island of Ireland.  I always talk about Northern Ireland and have always had an interest in it.  My greatest day was the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, and Margaret Thatcher introduced something that gave us a say in Anglo-Irish affairs and that led to the Good Friday Agreement because it opened the dialogue.<\/p> <p>For many years, including during the 1950s, hundreds of thousands of Irish men and women travelled to the UK.  We built the roads, taught the children and cared for the sick.  While we were well treated, there was no political dialogue between the two countries.  It could not have happened in any other place in the world.  There was such an impact.  My father, grandfather and many others' fathers worked there, but there was no dialogue.  Is it not wonderful that we can now travel to London, visit Westminster and talk to our colleagues?  The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach can meet the British Prime Minister or the British Foreign Secretary.  I was once told that if members of the Government travelled from Dublin to London in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have to wait three or four weeks to have a meeting with a third undersecretary at the British Foreign Office.<\/p> <p>That has changed since our accession to the EU in the early 1970s.  It gave us a parity of esteem with our nearest neighbours.  Unfortunately, some of those neighbours have not yet accepted that Ireland has moved on from the point of, as another speaker noted, there were just 11% of exports to the UK.  We want to be friends.  Whatever happens in the next few weeks or months, we will do our best to work with our friends in the UK to get the best deal possible.  Nevertheless, we are committed Europeans and Europe has given us a roadmap to a new, prosperous Ireland.  Our membership of the EU has helped to break down the divisions on the island of Ireland and those between Ireland and the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>We have to be conscious that the outcome of Brexit remains uncertain.  As a Government, country and Parliament, we are still trying to plan for multiple potential outcomes.  No deal is now far less likely, but it is certainly still a possibility.  The intensive work on no-deal Brexit planning remains very much banked and ready to be used if necessary.  We are now focusing on what we had previously described as a central case scenario, namely, the likelihood of getting a withdrawal agreement and then moving into a transition period.  We need to prepare for that but also for the potential outcomes.  If the UK Government ratifies the withdrawal agreement and the UK leaves the EU at the end of January, a new risk could emerge at that point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Simon Coveney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=06\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->At the end of the transition period, that is at the end of 2020, if the UK does not apply for more time, there is then the risk of not having a deal and not having any managed process or structure to continue that dialogue.  We would have the protections of the withdrawal agreement, in the context of the special arrangements for Northern Ireland to prevent Border infrastructure, protect the common travel area, CTA, and everything else that it does, but there could be significant pressure on our east-west trading relationship.  We have to anticipate the different outcomes and prepare the country for them, as we have tried to do right throughout this process.  That is despite the unpredictability of political debates and outcomes in Westminster.<\/p><p>For the first time, this week I brought a paper to Cabinet that focused more on preparation for the future relationship discussion than on a no-deal Brexit, although it did focus on both of those issues.  We will certainly gear up to ensure that Ireland remains relevant and as influential as we can be in shaping the outcome of a future relationship negotiation.  We are fortunate that Michel Barnier will be staying on as the EU chief negotiator, but in a slightly different co-ordinating role.  He certainly understands and knows the British-Irish relationship intimately and that will be helpful in the context of the discussion of the future relationship.  That will be the case, whatever the issues at stake, whether fishing, data protection or the implementation of the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.  <\/p><p>We will, of course, also have Phil Hogan as the EU trade commissioner.  He obviously understands Ireland's politics and economy and the unique exposure that have in many ways to the British economy.  It is true that only 11% to 13% of Irish exports are now going to the UK, that does not tell the full story.  Some 40,000 Irish companies trade with the UK every month.  In the past two years, approximately 102,000 Irish companies either traded with or through the UK.  We know that because the Revenue Commissioners wrote to all of them during the summer to encourage them to prepare for different outcomes to Brexit.  <\/p><p>The relationship for SMEs is important and that future relationship, from an Irish perspective, needs to be as integrated and close as we can make it.  That is why the ambition in the future relationship declaration for a quota-free, tariff-free trading relationship on the back of a free trade agreement is one that we will look to shape in a positive way.  We will also, however, be supportive of the EU position that if a tariff-free, quota-free trading relationship is to be facilitated, it will also have to have clear level playing field mechanisms in place to ensure that if the UK moves away from an EU regulatory model that we will not compete with the UK at a disadvantage.  <\/p><p>The political declaration is clear that the extent of the level playing field mechanisms within the withdrawal agreement will be directly related to how free the trade will be in the context of access tariffs and quotas.  That is going to become a difficult negotiation, as is every free trade agreement, but it is one that I hope we can progress positively to provide as much certainty as we can for businesses.  We must also, of course, try to protect the &euro;70 billion trade relationship we have east-west each year with the UK, which is greatly important for us.  <\/p><p>I will say a few words about Northern Ireland because several contributors have made comments on this aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I did not intend to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#AAA00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I have said on numerous occasions during this process that I regret that one of the consequences of the Brexit discussions has been a real straining in the relationship between unionism and the Government.

I have spent much time trying to do that and I will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>Following the Brexit outcome, my biggest priority between now and when we have a general election in this country will be to try to work with my British counterparts and parties in Northern Ireland to repair relationships that have undoubtedly been damaged, particularly in the past year.

I refer to the pressures of Brexit and the polarisation that has emerged from the Brexit outcomes and negotiated solutions.<\/p> <p>I am interested in talking to Senator Marshall and others about how we could explore civic engagement that could be more constructive than anything existing to date.  My experience so far with civic engagement with an Irish Government, a British Government or political parties is that it tends to be nationalists or unionists talking to themselves.  For example, when we tried to set up - and this turned out to be very successful ultimately - an all-island civic dialogue on Brexit and surrounding issues, it was unfortunate that representatives from unionism felt they could not be there.  They had their reasons and we have to respect that.

I have said that and I think my perspective is understood.  We have to try to settle Brexit issues, get the institutions up and running again and to create real dialogue where there is respect for identity and dreams and aspirations from different communities before we start talking about future constitutional challenges.

There is a generation in Ireland today, though, that sees Britain as an equal in negotiations and dialogue rather than a country of which we must be fearful or overly respectful in deference or anything like that.  It is how we have approached the Brexit negotiations from the outset.  We want to deal with the facts, the problems and the complexity that has been thrown up as a result of a decision by the UK as a whole to leave the EU.  We are not willing to concede on the basis of political pressure or lobbying.  We are trying to deliver an outcome we can stand over, that is politically operable and that protects our peace process while preventing the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure.<\/p><p>I hope we have always maintained that position in a respectful way.  It has frustrated some people but it has been a successful process from an Irish perspective in terms of getting an outcome we can live with.  Any outcome linked to the delivery of Brexit has significant downsides but I hope this is an outcome we can live with.  I also hope we can persuade many unionists in Northern Ireland who are fearful about the implementation and consequences of the current deal that they can also live with it in a way that is not overly threatening.<\/p><p>I also reassure people that we will look to put in place new political infrastructure to reinforce the British-Irish relationship in future in the same way that many closely bound countries in the EU do now.  For example, these include France and Germany or Portugal and Spain.  Britain and Ireland are neighbours and we have an intertwined history.  Much of it is very tragic but in more recent years, there is much that is positive.  We will look to put in place agreed structures between the British and Irish Governments to ensure we are meeting, at least on an annual basis, and looking at many joint projects together.  I hope we can also use the mechanisms, structures and institutions of the Good Friday Agreement to do this.<\/p><p>Like others, I pay my respects to Lady Sylvia Hermon, who has been a British MP for 18 years in the North Down constituency.  I got to know her through the Brexit process and I have enormous respect for her.  She is a proud unionist but she is an intelligent, tough, fair and open MP who listens but who is not afraid to challenge people.  She has been an extraordinary protector of the Good Friday Agreement through what has been a very divisive and difficult debate for unionists in the House of Commons at different times over the past number of years.  I would not have spoken about her like this if she were standing for election this time around as I would probably cost her votes by the bucketload by doing so.  As she is not standing, I can say that I have enormous regard for her as a unionist, her intellect and her contribution to British politics at a time we needed a voice like hers.  It is important to recognise that, shortly after she has made the decision to step down.<\/p><p>I look forward to returning to this House before the end of the year to give a further update.  We will know much more about what challenges Brexit is likely to deliver when we know the result of the British general election on 12 December.  I hope we will use some of the time between now and then to continue to prepare Ireland for different outcomes.  I will also use some of that time to put thought into how we can create opportunities or windows in Northern Ireland for constructive dialogue between parties to try to find a way after the British general election of re-establishing institutions that can function.<\/p><p>I have learned - in some ways the hard way - that there is never an easy window in politics in Northern Ireland and there is always a reason not to compromise, whether it is a general election, party conference season or the outcome of the renewable heat incentive inquiry, etc.  There is always a reason to pull back and not take a risk.  We need to create windows with political parties even in the aftermath of what I am sure will be a very divisive general election campaign in Northern Ireland to ensure we can focus on the re-establishment of devolved institutions that can function and deliver for people in Northern Ireland.  When we ask people on the street or in a business about this, they are exasperated by the lack of political decision-making capacity within Northern Ireland, which has been ongoing for three years.  We must find a way to change that and it is in everybody's interest, regardless of background, identity or political perspective, to try to find a way of doing that.  Otherwise we will face perhaps even more difficult choices around more decision-making coming from Westminster, the Irish Government needing to insist on its role as a co-guarantor of the agreement in future and the potential tension flowing from that.  It is not where we want to be and I ask Senators to think about how they can contribute positively to that dialogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#AAA00900","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireachta\u00ed \u00f3n D\u00e1il - Messages from D\u00e1il","time":1573036200,"counter":479,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#BBB00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":480,"content":"<p>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has passed on 6 November 2019 the Consumer Protection (Gift Vouchers) Bill 2018, considered by virtue of Article 20.2.2&deg; of the Constitution as a Bill initiated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, to which the agreement of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is desired.<\/p> <p>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has passed the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment Bill) 2019 on 6 November 2019, to which the agreement of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is desired.<\/p> <p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#BBB00300","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1573036200,"counter":481,"content":"<p>We propose to sit again next Tuesday at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019110600002#BBB00400","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1573036200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 7.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 November 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
