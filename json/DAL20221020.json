It is a priority for my Department to ensure that the courts are resourced so that we can administer justice efficiently and effectively for everybody who comes into contact with the justice system.  Judicial vacancies arise for a number of reasons, including retirements, promotion and, unfortunately, deaths in service.  The aim is always to fill such vacancies at the earliest opportunity and a number have been filled recently.  There are also a number of vacancies that will be filled in the coming weeks.  In order to bring more strategic focus to this, I established a judicial planning working group in April 2021, in line with commitments in the programme for Government and my own justice plan.  The working group is going to look at type and number of judges that we have to ensure that there is efficient and effective administration across the system as it currently stands.  We are also looking at how we can improve that over the next five years and build on that work.  Future judicial resourcing needs will be informed by the report and recommendations of this group.  I hope to have a finalised report by the end of November, if not earlier, and possibly the beginning of November.<\/p>  <p>  To help support the work of this group, the OECD was commissioned to prepare an independent review of judicial resources, including benchmarks against international comparators.  This is the first time that we have undertaken such an analysis since we established our own courts.  There was a bit of a delay due to the complexity of evaluating the data and analysis underpinning the research.  It has taken longer than originally anticipated for the OECD to complete its work.  The review is with my office.  I am hoping to meet with the judicial planning working group in the coming weeks, when it will submit the final report to me.  Our courts are under pressure not just due to Covid, although it has placed a significant pressure on them.  Acknowledging that fact, as an interim measure we increased the number of judges in the High Court from 37 to 42 last year with the enactment of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.  In addition, section 8 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 provided for the number of High Court judges to be exceeded by a further one should the Government so agree.  At my request, having consulted with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, it was decided that would be necessary.  Six additional High Court judges have been appointed, acknowledging the pressure that the courts are under.  Most importantly, the report will set out a much bigger figure and a timeline on implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000003#A00500","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1666252800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I understand the situation in regard to the High Court judges, and there has been an improvement in respect of that.  However, I think the key area in which we need to see improvement is in the Circuit Courts and District Courts, in particular.  Indeed, the whole family law system is hugely backed up.  Access to justice is a primary need and a primary right that citizens must have.  At the end of the day, if we do not have enough judges to carry out the roles that are required, we are simply failing the public.  That needs to be recognised.  I appreciate that the Minister has referenced the two reports and had outlined pieces of work that have been done to look into this issue, but to be frank, I do not think we need reports to look into it.  All we need to do is to talk to the people who are working in the courts and the judicial system.  We all know, and we all hear it all the time, that the cause of a major part of the significant delays is the absence of judges and not having enough judges.  Indeed, looking to the High Court and the higher courts that the Minister has spoken of, where additional capacity has been put in place, some of the judges are often pulled away.  There are tribunals, inquiries and all of that and the judges end up sitting on those.  We need a commitment from the Minister.

In its final report that will be published in the coming weeks, the group will set out exactly how many judges are needed.  Pre-empting that report, over &euro;2 million was allocated in the budget this year to ensure that we can start putting the resources and people in place.  While we can put judges in place, we need the support teams within the court structure to be able to support their work.  That is already happening and the money has already been allocated.  As well as that, to make sure that it is not just about judges and numbers, we have the implementation of the modernisation programme in the courts system.  That has received funding over the last two years, to make sure that we are using online resource and to ensure that the judges can be efficient and effective as possible.  The Deputy mentioned the family courts specifically.  We will be establishing a new family court structure in the coming weeks.  I will be bringing forward a Bill as well as a family justice oversight group working plan that will go hand in hand with that.  That will set out a completely different court structure, taking all of these family law matters out of the Circuit Courts and giving it its own structure, template and its own specialised judges, which I think will be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000003#A00700","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1666252800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I appreciate all of that, but at the same time, we have to recognise that the shortage of judges is having an impact not just on the number of cases going through the courts, but on the full utilisation of the services we have.

Yet, people are travelling to Dublin to access court services there.  They are getting on the train, leaving Limerick and going to Dublin.  Witnesses and victims of crime are having to do that when adequate facilities are in place in their own city to provide services.  That situation is replicated in many areas around the country.  I am told that a lot of that is because the judges do not want to travel from where they are based and because of the shortages.  There are issues around that.

That is my commitment.  I am making it very clear that we do not have enough judges and we need more.  The Deputy touched on a point in his response.  We cannot just add judges when greater efficiencies could be found within the current structure as well.  Part of the review, led by Brigid McManus, is not just looking at how many more judges we need, but at how we can have greater efficiencies within the system at the moment.  It is looking not just at the work that the judges do, including when they sit, how they sit and the hours they work, but how we can include the modernisation programme more to ensure that more people can be seen and more people can be seen at home, in prisons or in Garda stations.  It is about making sure that the whole system is interlinked as well, including the Prison Service, the Garda, the courts service, our family law structures and the various different agencies and organisations that work within the judicial system.<\/p> <p>Many strands of work are coming together and all of that will lead to a more efficient and effective system.

The budget this year was unprecedented, with &euro;2.14 billion being allocated to the Garda.  This will fund up to 1,000 new recruits next year and 400 additional Garda staff.  In the year just gone, funding was allocated for 800 Garda staff.  We will not be able to reach that full target because there have been some challenges in respect of Covid-19 at the Garda College in Templemore.  We were simply not able to get the numbers into the training college at the beginning of the year.  I am confident that on the basis of the new recruitment campaign, which saw 11,000 people put themselves forward to become members of the Garda, the first round of recruits will go into Templemore on 28 November 2022.  That will allow us to get into a system whereby every 11 or 12 weeks, there will be 200 recruits in Templemore.  That will allow us to reach the target of 1,000, as well as the 400 Garda staff positions that have been funded for next year.<\/p>  <p>  There were challenges around Covid-19 this year.  When we came to end of the previous recruitment campaign, a number of people had gone into different careers.  A number of people had decided to change path during the pandemic.

It is important that members of the Garda have a certain level of fitness.  There are challenges arising and we need to ensure we are on top of them.  I meet with the Garda Commissioner about this matter quite regularly.  I probably speak to him every couple of weeks, if not every week, specifically about the recruitment campaign and how things are going with the Public Appointments Service, which is an important part of the process.  The service must conduct the interviews and put the numbers forward before the students go into the college.  It is a lengthier process than we would like but I am confident, given that we now have a date of 28 November for the first of the new recruits from the 11,000 who applied for this campaign, that we will start a system that will see rolling numbers passing through Templemore and that we will not be interrupted by Covid-19 and the other challenges we have faced in the past year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000004#B00500","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1666253400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>It is important that we increase the strength of the force but deployment once that happens is another matter.

I meet with the various different representative groups and this is something that continually comes up, whether it is the Garda Representative Association, GRA, or the chiefs and supers making sure there is that support and mental health support for individuals, together with better internal communications and more transparent promotion processes.  All these things help to create a better work environment.

Established in 2006, the Garda Reserve represents a real opportunity for anyone wishing to support policing and to give something back to their communities.  The reserve reinforces An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's essential community links, and provides the capacity to draw on additional resources to assist in policing.  I would like to acknowledge the important contribution made by all members of the reserve who volunteer their time for the community's benefit.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to modernise and strengthen An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, A Policing Service for the Future, the Garda Commissioner has developed a Garda Reserve strategy for 2021-2025, which provides a roadmap for the development of this important service.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy published in October 2021 is informed by an internal review of the reserve, and sets out key commitments including recruitment, training and development, deployment, governance and evaluation.  A priority is a new recruitment campaign, which will be held next year and on foot of which new reservists will be appointed for five years initially.  The campaign will target a broad and inclusive range of candidates, in keeping with the reserve's role as a visible form of community engagement.  The Department of Justice is currently engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on revisions to the regulations governing the reserve ahead of the commencement of this recruitment process.  Consideration is also being given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensuring that the Garda Reserve can serve as a pathway to future recruitment competitions for Garda members, where individuals have a desire to progress to that position.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy further aims to ensure that members of the reserve are fully supported by local Garda management and that the role is recognised and promoted throughout the organisation.  The Garda Commissioner has established an implementation group and oversight committee to ensure that the strategy delivers on its objectives and I look forward to working with him to increase the number of members of the reserve and in realising its full potential as a resource to policing and in providing a pathway to full-time membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including from minority communities.

The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland concluded that the Garda Reserve programme was not being utilised to its full potential and recommended that future recruitment to the Garda Reserve should be paused pending the outcome of a comprehensive strategic review to examine how best to structure the reserve to meet the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

With the support of Government, it brings State agencies together with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local communities and local businesses.  We are asking communities what resources they need to keep them safe and what are the issues on the ground.  It is specific to individual communities.  A key component of the new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill 2021 is enshrining this right throughout the country and ensuring that every community has a community safety partnership and sets out its own plan that will be supported and resourced through the agencies with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and supported by Government.<\/p>  <p>  We have recently seen results in Drogheda, where there have been significant levels of crime, great amounts of antisocial behaviour and deprivation in certain areas.

It can be used in that way.  That is something I will take back and engage with the partnerships on to see if that is happening.  If not, it should be happening because it is a very good idea.  With regard to the timeline, one of the pilots has been launched in Longford and the other two are being worked on.  The intention is that by spring of 2024, we will be putting every single JPC in a position where they will transition into a community safety partnership.

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau is also having significant success in disrupting the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.  Its work is supported by divisional drugs units nationwide and by all garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely with international law enforcement partners.

More recently, in a Revenue joint operation in Balbriggan this month, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau seized &euro;226,000 worth of cannabis.

Investment and the work of the Courts Service will provide us with a much better system, whereby sentencing, the number and type of cases and any information we need is present in a more structured and formatted way than we currently have.  We do not have an appropriate system when it comes to types of cases, types of sentencing and various pieces of information coming into the courts.  That is being worked on and a significant investment has been provided in the two most recent budgets.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, in relation to sentencing, what a judge decides in a courtroom is up to the judge but it is the role of us in the D&aacute;il and Seanad to make sure we have appropriate legislation in place.  A review of minimum sentencing is under way.  There are two or three areas, specifically around drug-related offences, where we have minimum tariffs but, for the most part, we are looking at areas where we have maximum sentences.  There are a number of changes afoot, which I mentioned earlier.  One involves increasing the maximum sentence for assault causing harm, which is currently five years.  I believe it should be higher, specifically in the many domestic violence cases where a person pleads guilty and for a variety of reasons or because the victim has recovered, the sentence can be reduced to two years or even less.  That is not appropriate and we are increasing the maximum sentence to ten years.<\/p>  <p>  Conspiracy to murder is another area where we are increasing the sentence.  A person may fail in an attempt to kill somebody but the intent is no less there.  We are increasing the maximum sentence in such cases to life in prison.  We are making sure in the cases of non-fatal strangulation and stalking, which are being made stand-alone offences, that it is clear that these are significant offences.

It is disappointing to hear that we are not getting accountability for the consistency of sentencing we need.  I urge the Minister to get to grips with that.

When it is commenced, new enduring powers of attorney will be required to be created in accordance with the 2015 Act.

According to the National Disability Authority, only half of disabled people of working age are likely to be in employment.  A greater concern is the wait time for access to the Legal Aid Board, which was 44 weeks in January 2021.  For someone taking a case to the WRC under the Equal Status Act, that is far too long.

Historically, out-of-hours services have been something that GPs have provided.

There are solutions.  What GPs say to me is that we need to train more GPs and we need to increase the number of training places.  I agree about practice nurses and that we need protected funding for training in order that we can have a better skills mix within general practice.  We must also provide practice nurses with the option to become specialist nurses.  We must consider employing GPs directly to provide out-of-hours locum support, but also to provide the out-of-hours services that GPs are perhaps not covering.  We should have a blended mix of independent GP practices and directly salaried GPs who can do some of that work, but we also need a new, modern, fit-for-purpose contract.  The contract itself is quite archaic in terms of the staffing subsidy.  There is a lot that can be done.  If that is done, and we put the infrastructure in place, then we can expand free GP care.

Having a workforce planning strategy is very important and increasing training places is central to it.  That must be done.  When the Minister talks about increasing GP training, if he listens to GPs, which I am sure he does, many of them coming out of training places are opting to emigrate.  Perhaps the reason is that independent practice is not for them, which is why we should offer the option of salaried GPs in the public system and provide the necessary out-of-hours GPs.  As the Minister will appreciate and understand, that in turn will take pressure off acute hospitals and emergency departments.  We have far too many people attending emergency departments who should be cared for elsewhere.  Some of them simply cannot get access to out-of-hours GP services and end up in accident and emergency.<\/p>  <p>  There are lots of things that we can do.

What younger GPs say to me is that in the past, in their parents' generation, GPs sometimes worked 60, 70 and 80 hours a week.  They covered on-call and if somebody got sick in their community, they went out on Sunday night.  GPs coming in now say they do not want that.

This process began in the second half of 2021 and continues into 2022.  By the end of October, it is expected that 304 centres will have reopened, representing about 91% of day care services for older people.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about his local centre.

We all focus on the total number of people on waiting lists but my point, which I imagine the Deputy will agree with, was that the number that matters is the number of people who have been waiting for too long.  The example I gave was that if 2 million people had been referred for care but were waiting a matter of days, that would be a healthy, well-performing healthcare system.  What we have to look at is the number of people who have been waiting for too long.<\/p>  <p>  I might outline for the Deputy some numbers I received just last night.  The focus of the waiting list action plan, in the first instance, is to provide care for patients who we all know are waiting too long.  In the year to date, the outpatient waiting list - we are starting with those who have been waiting for more than 18 months - has fallen by 23% and is continuing to fall.  Over the past four weeks, a further almost 7,000 patients were taken off the outpatient list.  It is now at its lowest level this year, which I am sure the Deputy, like me, will welcome.  In terms of inpatients who have been waiting for more than 12 months, the numbers so far this year have fallen by 14%.  Obviously, we have a long way to go but that is very good to see, not least in the middle of a pandemic.  The most impressive figure relates to those awaiting a scope for more than 12 months.  That number has fallen this year by 74%.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, a lot more needs to be done.  The waiting list action plan for this year is year one of a multiyear approach to this.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has taken on a very ambitious programme of providing care for patients waiting for inpatient care for 15 high-volume procedures.  Those who have been waiting for more than six months will have their care arranged.  More than 80% of those patients have been contacted and have care authorised.  I am delighted to say the NTPF is now looking at moving the wait time from six months to five and increasing the number of high-volume procedures from 15 to 20.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000013#L01000","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1666258800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Of course, I welcome any reduction in the length of time people are awaiting care and I acknowledge the slight drop in that this year, but it is not just about people who are being treated.  According to my latest figures, 60,000 patients were taken off the waiting lists through a process of validation.  I do not disagree with that - it needs to be done because the waiting lists have to be fit for purpose - but they are not all people actually being treated.  Some of it relates to the fact we are cleaning up the waiting lists, which does need to be done.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated in an opinion piece published last February that he wanted to ensure people would not have to wait more than 12 months for any hospital procedure or 18 months for their first appointment by the end of this year.  In my view, that is certainly not going to happen.  A total of 120,000 people have still been waiting more than 18 months for their first outpatient appointment and 13,000 have been waiting longer than that.  I have spoken to hospital managers and they need more beds in some hospitals.<\/p> <p>They need more diagnostic capacity in public hospitals, not more outsourcing.  They need more community beds and recovery beds in order that they can discharge patients and speed up that process.  Crucially, they need more supports for people being cared for in the home and those with chronic conditions who are being cared for in the community.  All of these measures are part of the solution.<\/p> <p> Unless we have a long-term plan that beds in public investment rather than short-terms plans that are about outsourcing more and more, I do not believe we will actually get to a point where we really tackle the waiting lists.

There is no doubt that there are going to be workers who do not meet the criteria as set out, but who deserve it.  There is no doubt that there will be people who have actively helped patients and who, on an individual basis, we would say deserve the payment and if one group has got it, then this group deserves it as well.  It would not be possible to design criteria to identify every worthy person.  For example, many of the workers in general practice have a strong case, yet they were not included.

The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March, as he will be aware, and was referred to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Health for Committee Stage.  The legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time in this country, of a wide range of assisted human reproduction, AHR, practices.  It is important legislation.  The published Bill provides for domestic altruistic surrogacy, but not the regulation of surrogacy arrangements undertaken in other jurisdictions.  However, we have the report of the Special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  The Ministers for Justice, and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and I met immediately after that committee provided its report, and we asked our officials to come back to us as a matter of urgency with options and draft legislation on the recommendations.  What I want to do is to have a comprehensive set of amendments for Committee Stage that reflect the surrogacy recommendations insofar as Government decides on those.  I would like it to be done by the end of the year.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  There is ongoing engagement at ministerial and departmental level on that.  As the Deputy will be aware, besides the surrogacy amendments, the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill is important in and of itself.  I want that Bill through all Stages in this D&aacute;il session.  There are many reasons for that, one of which is IVF.  We will move to the provision of publicly-funded IVF for the first time next year.  I am talking to our own HSE fertility clinics about hiring the new staff to provide all of those new services.  To do that, the sector must be regulated.  I want the Bill through all Stages in this session, of which there are probably eight weeks left.  I would also like as broad an inclusion of the surrogacy recommendations on Committee Stage as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000017#P01000","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1666261200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>That is a welcome response.

The Minister knows what I am saying.  We are also hearing an increasingly coherent and strong voice coming from practitioners and medics in this area.  I know that they have engaged with the Minister and have sent position papers to him, as they have to Opposition spokespeople.  They have set out a wide range of recommendations on surrogacy and posthumous reproduction and on ensuring that the primary legislation does not restrict in any way, through its language, the development or use of ever-changing and ever-evolving treatments.  There is a lot to take on there.  If we can get this done by the end of the session, it would be most welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000017#P01100","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1666261200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I wish to make two points.

That is something we have to do.  I want that brought in, if at all possible, through Committee Stage amendments.  There are children and parents out there today to whom we will, and must, provide that certainty around parentage.  This is going to be a mechanism to do so.  On the point the Deputy raised in respect of the AHR professionals group, it submitted a position paper setting out 12 recommendations.  My officials have been meeting with them.

For everyone who meets those guidelines, I have asked the HSE to fast-track those payments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000019#R00600","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1666262400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>They should all get it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000019#R00700","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666262400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 87 and 88 taken with Written Answers.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services","time":1666262400,"counter":223,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000019#R00900"},{"type":"question","time":1666262400,"counter":224,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[52376\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000019#R01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the issue of backlogs in dental treatment for primary school children and the need for urgent recruitment of dentists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1666262400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I raise a question about our public dental system, particularly as it relates to primary school students.

The HSE public dental service provides care for children up to 16 years of age.  It includes emergency care, a fissure sealant programme and care for orthodontics.  There have, as the Deputy correctly said, been significant delays in the provision of these services.  These were significant before Covid-19 arrived and, as with many other patient services, Covid has made them worse.  It is not acceptable that children and their families are facing these long waiting periods for access to oral healthcare.  It is a top priority for me and the Government to address it.  Critically, we are backing that sentiment up with money, which is what matters.  I have allocated an unprecedented &euro;15 million in the budget for next year to enhance the provision of oral health services.  A dedicated amount of nearly &euro;5 million has been provided to develop a comprehensive oral healthcare package for children.  This will make a huge difference.  This is an intervention package for children from birth up to seven years of age and is aligned with the national oral health policy.<\/p> <p>We will see the benefits of these packages in the years to come.  On top of that, I have allocated &euro;9 million specifically to address the waiting lists in orthodontics, which the Deputy has quite rightly called out, and to allow the public dental service to provide care to all eligible children.  In addition to the &euro;15 million allocation, resources will also be available to recruit more orthodontists.  There has been a specific request for orthodontists to provide clinical leadership within the HSE to drive this oral health strategy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte.

As we discussed earlier, families, some of whom I have met, have very reasonable and important questions.  Essentially, they want to know what happened.  In some cases, their loved ones died during the first Covid surge and they were faced with unimaginable difficulties in desperately trying to find out what was going on when not able to access the nursing home.  All of the nursing homes came under enormous pressure but it was particularly bad in certain homes.  Families want answers and access to the truth and they must have it.  The Government and I want to find a process whereby those families can get those answers without the whole thing becoming legalistic and taking years with the risk that they may not ultimately get those answers.  We have various options that we have seen work well in the past.  For example, Dr. Scally's inquiry into CervicalCheck worked well.  This was not a public inquiry.  Dr. Scally took private testimony and produced what most of us agree was a very good and very useful report.<\/p>  <p>  I know that there are people who are looking for a public inquiry but the problem with a public inquiry is that those involved, including those running the nursing homes, take legal advice, as they should.  In the past, we have often seen legal teams go to the High Court to seek injunctions.  We are then in a very difficult position because it becomes increasingly difficult to ask the questions that need to be asked and to get answers to them.  This is further complicated by the fact that there are now quite a number of active court cases ongoing.  As we all know, the legal advice that some of these nursing homes will get is that they should not participate.  We need to find a mechanism that avoids all of that and gets the families the answers they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000020#S01400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1666263000,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I accept that there are difficulties but it is fair to say what the families want is a full public inquiry.

We are already very late into the game.  We are dealing with families who had to deal with a great deal of trauma in losing loved ones.  There are specific circumstances with regard to Dealgan House and the fact that the HSE determined to take it over.

The latest round of energy price increases announced by the providers is putting real pressure on families and workers right across the State.  In the first half of this year, over 700 households were disconnected from their electricity and over 300 had their gas disconnected.  Since then, bills have skyrocketed.  More and more families are falling behind.  The possibility of these numbers increasing over the winter months is very real.<\/p>  <p>  This week, Sinn F&eacute;in passed a D&aacute;il motion calling on the Government to ensure all households would be protected from gas and electricity disconnections during the winter months.  At the core of the motion were two demands.  The first was a ban on disconnections now, instead of what the Government is planning which is in December.  Second, this ban would apply to all households, including the hundreds of thousands of households that use prepay meters, which this Government has forgotten about and abandoned.  This is the urgent action we need.  As the weather turns, the fear of disconnection is very real and very present.  Two weeks ago, the Taoiseach gave a commitment.  He said that nobody would be disconnected this winter, including households using prepay meters.  These were welcome words but they were only words, with no action to deliver on them.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of taking responsibility to protect households from disconnection, the Minister told them to go to the local social welfare officer.  To make matters worse, his Green Party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, went on TV on Sunday and told people not to look to the Government for help but to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Citing measures the Government has taken, he said: \"St. Vincent de Paul and MABS are working with electricity providers to provide friendly credit.\"  His comments reveal yet again that this Government is painfully out of touch.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does incredible work.  Nobody can take away from that.  Only for it, many people would go hungry in this State.  However, it beggars belief that a Minister of State would heap further pressure on it during such difficult times.  It just is not good enough for the Government to outsource its responsibility to charities.  We need a real plan.  We need a plan from the Government that ensures every single household is protected from disconnections this winter.  Some prepay companies already have bans on disconnections at weekends, public holidays or during other peak times.  This ban should be extended to all households 24-7, providing that protection during the winter period.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister needs to grasp this issue with urgency.  We have been saying this for weeks and we have been saying it to his Government colleagues for weeks.  This is in his portfolio.  This is his responsibility.  All households need to be protected from energy disconnections this winter.  The Government must introduce a disconnection ban now and ensure those using prepay meters are included.  I have some simple questions for the Minister.  Does this Government have any intention whatsoever of giving action to the commitment the Taoiseach gave that nobody would be disconnected this winter, including those on prepaid meters, or was that just a false promise?  Will the Minister do the right thing?  Will he give action to those words?  Will he introduce a ban on disconnections for households immediately and run it to the end of March?  Crucially, will he ensure the hundreds of thousands of people who use prepay meters are included in this ban?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000021#T00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1666263600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach was absolutely right that this Government is committing to protecting and helping every single family and household through this very difficult time in paying energy bills.  There is a variety of measures.  If they were easy and simplistic solutions that would be great but that is not the real world.  In this real world what is actually working is the range of measures the Government is delivering on, such as increases in social welfare protection and increases in energy payments to households.  As I understand it, last week Sinn F&eacute;in was arguing that we should be giving greater loans to people in difficulty, particularly households using prepay meters.  From listening and talking to the experts in the area, they say that is not the right solution because it would put people into further debt.  We have been talking to the energy supply companies and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and setting out a policy in a co-ordinated and proper way.  We will come out in the coming weeks with a further iteration of our combating energy poverty action plan.  That will build on what actually works.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy says this measure is charity.  I disagree.  What we are talking about here is the community, the Governments, NGOs and others working together.  It is not charity.  It is appropriate that we use the tools that work.  Sinn F&eacute;in has argued against special needs payments and says that should not be our approach.  Sinn F&eacute;in's budget proposed a &euro;15 million hardship fund.  So far this year we have spent &euro;38 million.  The Minister for Social Protection has committed to making sure we have the staff and the resources so that any household in difficulty is able to avail of those funds.  That is far better than the credit solution Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing, which would put families into further debt difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  We launched the next phase of the #ReduceYourUse campaign yesterday.  We did so in the offices of Alone because of its expertise and ability to find, target and help households, particularly those in older age groups, that might not find it easy to go through the social welfare system.  We are targeting, identifying and helping them.  It is right and appropriate to use the mechanisms that are in place and that are working.  Rather than cutting people off, households can avail of the funds that are there and which can be deployed with advice from MABS, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others.  Why would we get rid of a system that has the financial resources to help those households and is working?  We will continue to make sure it works right through this winter period.<\/p>  <p>  It is so easy to suggest a facile solution to what is actually a very complex situation, where every household has different circumstances.  The right approach in tackling poverty and energy poverty at this particular time is providing cash payments.  That is the best way to help people through, as well as a range of other measures.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has already significantly changed its rules and recognised this problem, so if people do get into debt difficulties, they will have much easier repayment schedules.  Anyone in such difficulty, particularly those on prepay meters, has to have access to the cheapest payment rates.  It is these practical measures that actually address the problem and will get us through this difficult period.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, if there are any gaps or any instances where people are not able to get resources to help, we will look at that and go back and change the policy.  That commitment from the Government is real.  That commitment to help our households is real in the billions of euro that have been provided in energy credit payments, which will start on 1 November.  That is a measure where people get cash and we saw how the first payment worked.  The number of families in arrears went from about 200,000 down to 150,000.  That was from one payment.  We have three further payments to deploy.  That is real money and real help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000021#T00300","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1666263600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Minister said the Government will look at this \"if there are any gaps\".  Let me point out the gap.  There are 450,000 households that the Government has abandoned.  The Minister spoke about energy credits.  They are welcome and they will be available to people but there is also a ban on disconnections for hundreds of thousands of people who use bill payment.  Why is that?  It is because the Government recognises that this winter is going to be severe and that there should be a ban but for 450,000 people on prepay meters, the Government has decided to abandon them.  The Minister said the Taoiseach was right.  The Taoiseach did not say the Government would do all it can.  He said nobody will be disconnected this winter.  The disconnections are happening.  The Minister talked about the real world.  This is happening.  People are self-disconnecting.  That is what is really happening.  Why can we not have a bit of fairness?  There could be one house beside the next with the same financial problems and getting the same energy credit but one has the protection that it will not be disconnected this winter and the other does not.

Millions of litres of raw sewage continue to be discharged into our rivers and our seas every day.  Only half of our sewage was treated to EU environmental standards in 2021.  That is way below the EU average of 90%.  In Ringsend, which is in the Minister's constituency, sewage is regularly spewed into Dublin Bay, destroying one of the city's most treasured natural amenities.  A survey last year from SOS Dublin Bay found that more than one fifth of people who came into contact with water in Dublin Bay through swimming or watersports became ill.  The survey calculated that the situation was so bad that it was the equivalent of 74 Olympic swimming pools of untreated wastewater being discharged into Dublin Bay every month.<\/p>  <p>  We are told that the problem will not be rectified until 2025.  In total, the EPA has identified 38 areas where work needs to be prioritised to prevent wastewater from harming our rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters.  Irish Water has no clear plan for 27 of these areas.  I listened to Mr. Michael Tinsley from Irish Water on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning.  He seemed to suggest that Irish Water has not provided timelines or plans to the EPA for this work because it regularly gets criticism for failing to meet those targets.  In other words, Irish Water does not have confidence in its ability to deliver projects on time and it has simply stopped publishing deadlines so that it cannot be held accountable for failure.<\/p>  <p>  Another concerning aspect of the report is that those areas where work has been completed are failing to meet EU environmental standards.  Clonakilty, Kinsale and Ballymote have the necessary treatment infrastructure to meet the environmental standards.  They met the standards in 2020 but failed to meet them in 2021.  Will the Minister tell the House what is happening in that scenario?  Can critical investment in our wastewater infrastructure be accelerated so that works are completed ahead of schedule?  This is especially important in urban areas like Ringsend.  These delays are having a disproportionately negative impact on water quality.  Why are the towns where investment has been made in infrastructure failing to meet environmental standards?<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned with the lack of accountability in Irish Water.  We know it is not publishing deadlines because it does not want to face criticism for not meeting them.  It is also the case that there is little accountability for budgets.  Irish Water is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and therefore is not within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given that Irish Water has a budget of more than &euro;1 billion of public money, when is that going to change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000022#U01600","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1666264200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right to draw attention to the need to have clean water systems, which is a critically important issue for our country.  We need to manage our systems, including our wastewater treatment and our public water systems, in a way that ensures the Irish public and the environment have water that is clean and is in pristine condition for bathing or for other reasons.  That is not the case at the present time.  It is important to recognise the work of the EPA.  The report it published last week recognises that there is an issue around our wastewater treatment systems.  However, it is also an issue around agricultural policy and forestry policy.  A critical response is needed in the river basin management system so that we integrate all of the different aspects that affect water quality and get the proper water quality we deserve.<\/p>  <p>  More immediately, with regard to Irish Water, first there is a recognition of the problem.  The recent budget allocated &euro;1.6 billion to Irish Water to address the key areas where there is a shortfall; for example, where raw sewage is being deposited, particularly when storm waters are mixing in.  During yesterday's bad weather, storm water systems would have been running into the wastewater systems.  That is a particular problem right across the country, particularly in my own city of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Progress is being made.  The money that is being spent will have an effect and make a difference.  The key statistic the Deputy raised, correctly, is that currently only 50% of wastewater is being treated to EU standards.  The completion of the Ringsend treatment plant will bring us up to the 90% she cited as the European norm.  Ireland should go beyond the norm.  That plant will be completed.  I visited it and saw the work that is being carried out.  It is a critical part in addressing one of the areas where we have a particular problem, which is in Dublin.  We cannot stop there, however.  We must go further.  A total of &euro;6 billion is committed in the capital programme between 2021 and 2025.<\/p>  <p>  We need to continue on a systematic basis to address and invest in our water quality.  This is something that was not always popular in previous Governments or in this House in previous years.  We were not able to get the political agreement to raise and allocate money for wastewater and water treatment systems.  The money is there now.  With regard to Irish Water, structurally, there is now an opportunity to look at reporting or other mechanisms.  We will be passing legislation to separate Irish Water out from Ervia.  I suggest that any measures or proposals the Deputy has with regard to Irish Water's governance structure, or how it reports to this House, could be addressed in that legislation.  I understand it will come to the House shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The political commitment on the Government side, and I believe from the Opposition, is clear.

I also have concerns about the oversight of the spend and about value for money.  For example, if Irish Water was under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, and if the Comptroller and Auditor General audited Irish Water's accounts, we could examine value for money.  Value for money is not just about what is spent and whether the tender is the cheapest one; it is also about the failures.  We are not able to get under the bonnet of that issue because it is not under the remit of the committee.  I believe two pieces of legislation are required, and not just one.

We witnessed a spike in local house prices as high-tech jobs relocated from the Dublin docks to rural townlands, with the knock-on potential to reduce the climate impact of transport in rural areas by reducing the need to commute long distances.  Despite this, the Climate Change Advisory Council report from the OECD on reducing Ireland's transport emissions makes no reference to broadband or remote working.  This is despite the OECD saying there was an opportunity for policymakers to design and implement meaningful and integrated policy packages that prioritise transformative actions and deliver the emissions reductions required.<\/p>  <p>  As a former climate Minister, I am all too aware of the bizarre system whereby official Ireland has dismissed the transformative impact of the roll-out of broadband infrastructure on carbon emissions, despite the fact that 37% of our population live in rural areas.  Not only has the Government made no attempt to deliver on its programme for Government commitment on broadband, but it has also failed to meet its most recent target of having 20% of the public service working remotely by the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  One way to achieve remote working targets is to establish public service remote working hubs in every decentralised public building across the country.  We have hundreds of available spaces with all the services, including secure networks, and the added bonus of ensuring staff could work in clusters, which would break down the silo mentality we have in our public service.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to use the digital hubs located across the country as a stimulus to support private sector employers rolling out hybrid working to their employees.  This overcomes the health and safety and HR challenges of home working while providing employees with the opportunity to work in a communal environment with the necessary infrastructure but without the need to commute long distances.  It also provides a unique opportunity for innovation that could lead to significant employment creation through spin-off companies.  To achieve the proper utilisation of both public and private sector employment hubs requires a government that recognises the climate and well-being potential of such hubs and requires engagement with employers and employees with a can-do approach.  Sadly, there is no indication that the Government is coming to that realisation yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000023#V00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666264800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The national broadband plan had difficulties in the first two years due to Covid, problems at local authority level, the technical aspect around ducting and so on.

Schools and the broadband connection point centres across the country are in place.  We can never be happy that it is fast enough but it is starting to deliver.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy's central premise.  There is huge potential for life to come back into the centres of towns and villages across rural Ireland, using broadband and new remote working systems.  The T&aacute;naiste will deliver legislation in that regard shortly.  I accept this is a potential we need to deliver on.  The Government recognises that.  It set out a strategy in May 2021, a year and a half ago, that it would establish 400 remote working hubs by 2025, of which 300 are already up and running.  They are in place and working.  The other 100 will be done well in advance of that target deadline.  They are in just the right places, typically the centres of towns and villages, in old courthouses, cinemas or convents.  The Government has provided &euro;100 million through the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to help to deliver those and they are being delivered.  The Minister also introduced, very cleverly, a voucher scheme so people could go in and trial it, test it, get used to it and see if it works for them.  That is the  practical and clever way.  She has also resourced the local authorities so they can promote and make use of the hub network.<\/p>  <p>  My sense, with which Deputies opposite might disagree, is that it is happening in towns around the country.  It varies, depending on local circumstances, but we are starting to see the advent of remote working coming out of Covid, when different patterns were set in place.  New broadband technologies mean one can share and send files, have Zoom meetings and do many other things.  It is starting to happen.  It is working.  We need to go further.  We need to use Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe funding to turn around derelict or disused buildings in the centre of towns, so people are living there as well as working.  The towns that are seeing it happen are the ones that are progressing.  It helps us to address our housing crisis.  Rather than everyone having to be in the cities or expensive and difficult urban areas, we are using our incredible network of 19th-century market towns.  We turned away from them in previous decades, but we are turning back now.

To allow this to happen, councils and State agencies need to provide sites to these wireless operators so they can install transmitters to distribute the wireless broadband services.  Because the extension of these services will have a short life span, up to the end of 2027, when the national broadband plan will be completed, these shites - sites - should be provided rent-free by councils and State agencies, in a proactive measure to reach out to the most isolated communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000023#V00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1666264800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I will look at that proposal and we will give it real consideration.

But when I speak I do so on behalf of the constituents I am here to represent and who have been continuously on to me about this matter.<\/p> <p> We have a housing crisis, that is very clear, and we have to get more supply, that is very clear, but targeting people in the short-term letting is a flawed tactic.  Up until now, operators of short-term lets in rent pressure zones needed to apply for planning permission to run their business but mostly, when they apply, they are refused.  People who are short-term letting are more likely to leave their homes and properties lying idle for a family member or sell it rather than rent it out long term.  They do not want to go from short term to long term.<\/p> <p> For example, Killarney is full up at the moment but it is not at capacity because of tourism or short term lets but because a lot of free bed spaces in the town are taken up with people seeking asylum and refuge here.  Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that but it is putting a serious strain on services.  For instance, Dr. Gary Stack was on Radio Kerry recently explaining the pressures that is putting on the medical service to those in the town.<\/p> <p> The Government has said that it will regulate and manage the short-term lets and it will get more properties on a short-term basis back into the long-term rental market.  This is not going to happen.  The Government is actually instructing local authority enforcement officers to go out and frighten people into applying for planning which will not be granted and that the properties will simply lie idle as these operators, some of whom have operated in the short-term rental market for over 30 years, will not rent out long term.  The Government is trying its best to tell these people, who have worked so hard, saved up, paid for their houses or properties, got a mortgage and tried to make an income from it, what to do with their own property and that it is to be rented long term.  This will have the opposite effect entirely.  It is so wrongful for the Government to think that it can force people to do something with the property that they own.  We are living in a free society after all.  These properties did not fall out of the sky to these people.  They worked with the sweat off their brow and they broke their backs in many cases to build, maintain and own their properties.  And now the Government thinks that it will dictate to them and tell them what they are to do with it?  It will not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000023#V00900","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666265400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I will start by welcoming the group.

No one should underestimate the scale of the challenge and the difficult decisions we will have to make now to continue that approach, which is the right approach I think we all agree.  But it is going to be challenging.<\/p>  <p>  No one is throwing away or disregarding the rights of property owners.  We could have a wider discussion about our Constitution and whether we have the correct balance with the right to housing, property and so on but we are not going to go towards a system where the rights of property are completely removed or taken away.  There is real need for us to look at the private rental sector.  We all know it is not working and it does need to change.  It is not an attack on landlords or taking away their rights.  We may need incentives or other measures but we need to be very flexible and quick particularly in the next six months with property because if the numbers keep coming, 1,500 every week, we will have to show further flexibility and innovation, working with landlords and the whole variety of different accommodation providers that we might need to use.

However, my understanding, from speaking to the organisers of school transport on the ground, is that this is not happening and that one of the reasons for that is they have been told there have to be ten or more children with concessionary tickets on the bus.  Most of the buses are mini-buses and there might be only 15 to 20 children on them anyway and, therefore, that would mean half of them would have to have concessionary tickets.  If that rule is being applied, it simply will not work.  Will the Minister get clarity on that?

The purpose of these amendments is twofold.  First, they allow for the temporary replacement of a member of the complaints review committee by providing for an alternate member of the committee to substitute for the absence of a member in additional circumstances.  The amendment also provides for the recusal and replacement of a judicial member of the committee in circumstances where the judge in question is the subject of a complaint or otherwise has a conflict of interest in the context of a complaint.  The second purpose of these amendments is to clarify the role of the Judicial Council's investigations into the conduct of a judge and to provide for investigations of judicial misconduct in the absence of, or after withdrawal of, a complaint.<\/p><p>Part 8 amends miscellaneous Acts relating to the courts.  These include an amendment to section 39 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 to authorise the Courts Service to appoint registrars to a Special Criminal Court in recognition of the position that all such registrars are appointed from among Courts Service staff.  The Court Officers Act 1945 is also being amended to allow for the introduction of an offence of obstruction of, or interference with, a sheriff.  This will provide legislative protection for sheriffs in the discharge of their functions.  The amendment to the Courts Act 1964 seeks to cure an anomaly regarding the date on which proceedings in the District Court are considered to be commenced for the purpose of the Statute of Limitations.  The final amendment in this Part is to the Courts Service Act 1998 and will ensure the Courts Service's strategic plan is approved by the incoming Courts Service board rather than by the outgoing board as is the current position.<\/p><p>The final Part, Part 9, contains five sections amending miscellaneous Acts in a number of important areas of civil law.  It includes an amendment to the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 to substitute the word &quot;licence&quot; for &quot;permit&quot; in section 28(11).  This will correct a textual error which will resolve an issue that appears to prevent prosecutions for failure to comply with licence conditions.  The amendment to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 clarifies the text of section 11B which enables relatives of a child, and other adults who reside or previously resided with a child, to apply to court for an order giving access to the child.<\/p><p>The amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 will classify as civil servants, for pension purposes only, those solicitors who retired from the Legal Aid Board prior to 1 June 2014.  This is required because section 11 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 designated serving Legal Aid Board solicitors as civil servants with effect from 1 June 2014 whereas they had previously been classified as public servants.<\/p><p>The amendment to the Immigration Act 2004 will be split into two parts.  The first will fix a typographical issue.  The second will provide that permission to land or be in the State can be renewed or varied without the non-national holder of the permission having to make an application for such renewal in every case.<\/p><p>There will also be two amendments to the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020.  The first amendment will clarify that the holding of hearings remotely shall be optional for bodies designated under that Act, depending on their needs or requirements.  The second amendment will insert a new section in the Act to provide for the interference with hearings held remotely under the Act to be considered an offence.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the amendments I intend to propose on Committee Stage.  Earlier this year, I received Government approval to reform duty of care legislation, which is a key insurance reform measure and a very important part of the Government's overall action plan for insurance reform.  I propose to bring forward a number of amendments to the Occupiers' Liability Act 1995 in line with Justice Plan 2022 and the Government's policy objective of restricting the liability of occupiers.  As I have said, I believe these proposals strike the right balance between ensuring that businesses, community groups, organisations and organisers of events fulfil their duty of care responsibilities while also acknowledging the importance of the personal responsibility of visitors, recreational users and trespassers.<\/p><p>Additional amendments will also include measures aimed at further assisting the modernisation of our courts system and helping to drive efficiencies.  This will include amendments on court offices and court officers, centralising the functions of summoning jurors and a number of other related areas that will drive improvements in court processes.<\/p><p>I plan to propose a number of amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  These will include amendments regarding the levy model that funds the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA.  These amendments are based on the recommendations set out in the 2015 review of the operation of the Legal Services Regulation Act, which was published in March 2019.  These changes will modernise the model used and ensure the LSRA can fulfil its full mandate.<\/p><p>Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1998 are also being prepared.  These relate to the reform of the process for registering the vesting of a bankrupt's property in the official assignee after bankruptcy adjudication.  They will also provide for the official assignee in bankruptcy to make inquiries and provide information on the personal data of a bankrupt person as are necessary and proportionate to the effective performance of his or her statutory functions.  In addition, provision will be made to authorise public bodies to provide the requested information to the official assignee on foot of such an inquiry.<\/p><p>I intend to introduce further amendments to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956.  I know it has been a cause for concern for some that children born in Ireland to non-Irish parents do not have an automatic entitlement to citizenship.  The Government believes that providing a shorter pathway to citizenship is the right thing to do for these children.  My officials continue to work with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of amendments to the Act to reduce from five to three the number of years' residence required for children born in the State to become eligible for citizenship by naturalisation.  This will allow children who are currently on a pathway to Irish citizenship to attain this status at an earlier stage.  The amendments will provide a clear and specific procedure that will apply where a citizenship application is made for a child.<\/p><p>The Government has also approved the introduction of amendments to this Act to make further provision for the continuous residence condition for naturalisation.  This matter was the subject of High Court and Court of Appeal judgments in 2019 in the case of Jones <i>v.<\/i>Minister for Justice and Equality.  I intend to bring forward on Committee Stage a provision aimed at addressing a minor anomaly in section 7 of this Act on the entitlement to Irish citizenship of grandchildren of Irish citizen officials posted abroad in the public service.<\/p><p>I intend to introduce a number of amendments to the Data Protection Act 2018.<\/p> <p>These will include measures to ensure data subjects have third-party beneficiary rights in primary law and amendments clarifying confidentiality obligations and the powers of the Data Protection Commission in regard to its issuance of reprimands.  A further proposed amendment will, for the first time, confer jurisdiction to hear data protection actions in the District Court.  As matters currently stand, the Circuit Court and High Court are the only courts that can hear such actions.  Enabling the District Court to hear these actions will improve citizens' access to justice when initiating data protection actions and should reduce the associated costs for both data subjects taking a case and those providing a defence to claims.<\/p> <p> I will provide for unincorporated bodies, such as golf clubs and voluntary committees, to conduct their meetings remotely, notwithstanding any internal rules of the body requiring in-person meetings.  This provision will be similar to that which was included in the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 during the Covid pandemic.  However, that provision was linked to the pandemic and has since expired.  This new provision will not be related to any public health situation.<\/p> <p> I hope to introduce an amendment to section 7A of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, which will permit a single judge to review appeals.  This will be provided with a view to improving efficiency and costs associated with the Court of Appeal.<\/p> <p> I plan on introducing an amendment to the Succession Act 1965 to allow district probate registrars to certify a particular part of the process rather than, as matters stand, the district registrar, thereby streamlining the process.<\/p> <p> I will amend the Civil Liability Act 1961 to provide for an alternative indexation rate for periodic payment orders to be considered, if more suitable, so they can be set out by regulations made by the Minister for Justice with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I also hope to include a provision allowing courts to deal with cost orders in writing unless there is a need for an oral hearing.<\/p> <p> I also intend to update the definition of \"civil proceedings\" in section 10 of the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 and to make express reference to criminal proceedings within the meaning of Part 4 of the Act, which will clarify the holding of proceedings, especially in relation to the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.<\/p> <p> Finally, Part 15 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Justice for a pre-action protocol relating to clinical negligence actions.  However, I have been informed that difficulties have arisen regarding the statutory basis for making pre-action protocol regulations pursuant to Part 15.  I intend to bring forward amending legislation to address these difficulties for enactment as part of this Bill.  The introduction of pre-action protocols is an important commitment in Justice Plan 2022.<\/p> <p> I am considering recommending to the Government that an amendment to the Arbitration Act 2010 be included in this Bill at a later stage.  This amendment would permit third-party funding in limited circumstances, specifically in commercial arbitration.  This update to the legislation will have a positive impact and benefit to the international perception of the Irish legal framework, while removing any doubts regarding the ability to enforce arbitral awards in the State.<\/p> <p> I appreciate this is wide-ranging Bill for which I have set out a number of important amendments, and I propose to bring more amendments on Committee Stage.  The reason for me bringing many amendments at a later stage is that, as is the case with any miscellaneous Bill, there is always something to be added.  It is important, however, that we get this Bill into the House and passed as quickly as possible.  That is why I have set it out in this way and indicated the further work that is being done and will be completed by the time we reach Committee Stage.  I thank the Deputies for taking time to consider these issues.  Many of these issues, some of which are very minor and others more substantial, will make the law more efficient and effective in the areas that have been addressed.  I look forward to hearing their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000029#EE00300","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666268700,"counter":362,"content":"<p>This Bill is mainly administrative but it contains a large number of minor changes.  Some amendments will have positive impacts and the majority of them are very welcome.  The delays in courts and the backlogs we have seen have become a serious concern.  The ongoing review of the Judiciary and judicial system is reflected in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The general consensus is that given that much of the law in this area dates back decades and, in some cases, centuries, parts of it need to be adjusted to the modern framework in which we work.  That is clearly what this Bill is attempting to achieve, and it is welcome in that respect.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned issues with bankruptcy law.  We need to look into bankruptcy and the whole personal insolvency practitioner system.  This will have greater relevance given the cost-of-living issues that have arisen.  We all remember the crash of 2008-09 and the number of companies that went into bankruptcy and the number of people who fell into financial distress.  The law at that time was not equipped properly to deal with that.  There have been some changes since then but more are needed.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the international aspect of this and the promotional campaign under way in other common law countries to make Ireland a centre for international business.  While there are opportunities for us in terms of the legal framework we have here, they will be hampered if we do not get all of this stuff right.  It is important, therefore, that we work with the Minister to ensure that happens.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister indicated she intends to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in regard to Irish children born here of parents from outside the State who, under the current regulations, are not automatically entitled to citizenship.  Something needs to be done about that and the amendment will be very welcome.  We need to see this happen as quickly as possible.  I am sure all Deputies in their constituencies, as well as Senators, will have come across people who were born, raised and went to school here and know only Ireland as their home, yet they are not Irish citizens.  I find it very difficult to work that out.  The process of naturalisation and the means of attaining citizenship must be sped up.<\/p>  <p>  On the offence of obstructing a sheriff, I would like to tease that out a little and we probably will.  It is one of the provisions that we require more detail on and the sooner we can get that, the better.  Hopefully, we will discuss that in more detail on Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In a number of evictions and repossessions, particularly of family homes, there have been issues with agents of banks, or whoever else, carrying out court-ordered evictions.  Sometimes there have been very aggressive behaviour and unsavoury scenes in Dublin and other parts of the country, which have led to public outrage.  We need to find a way of getting the law on that right, because the current law has flaws that are reflected in these serious situations.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment to the Judicial Council Act is also welcomed.  The independence of the Judiciary must be preserved, while at the same time issues of misconduct, or whatever one might call it, need to be addressed.  There needs to be a mechanism to do that.<\/p>  <p>  In general, the overall thrust of the Bill is welcome.  There is too much in it.  We could be here for hours if we were to go through it piece by piece.  What we need to do is pass the Bill on Second Stage and try to work out on Committee Stage the areas on which we differ in focus or analysis.  However, in general, the Bill is welcome and I hope we can move it along quickly.  I hope we will work through the areas on which we may have differences of opinion or issues on which we want more clarity.  We will work in co-operation to bring the Bill through the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000030#FF00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1666268700,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I have to go, I am afraid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000030#FF00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1666268700,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I do not think this Bill will make many headlines but it is obviously important.

There probably have been times when that has not happened and there have been unintended consequences of old legislation that requires updates.  It is good to see we are dealing with some of that.<\/p>  <p>  There was some concern that the text of the Bill differed from the heads of the Bill.  I would have been somewhat worried about the issue of citizenship but the Minister has addressed that.  Hopefully, we will be able to deal with the situation of families with children who fear deportation to a country they have never known.<\/p> <p>We definitely need to deal with that issue.<br\/><br\/>With reference to the amendment of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, we all remember the huge difficulties we had during the financial crash and the fact that we had bankruptcy legislation that was not fit for purpose.  We had almost Victorian notions regarding bankruptcy, although the legislation has been updated.  We all accept, however, that there are still means to improve it.  We are talking about people who find themselves in a difficult set of circumstances.  We must do all we possibly can to facilitate them in getting out of that.  We had cases of people being in and out of prison on serious charges and spending less time in difficulty than those who faced bankruptcy.  As we enter a troubling period with serious economic dangers ahead, we could be looking at more instances of this.  Hopefully, that will not be the case, but we need to make sure we have the legislative tools to deal with this.<br\/><br\/>We all know businesses that are under severe pressure due to inflation, particularly in energy costs.  We have all spoken on various issues concerning particular businesses and families and households.  At times, we need to find more bespoke solutions.  There will be a need for more of those as we continue.  As I said, we need to ensure we have a decent bankruptcy process so that people will be able to resolve their debts and businesses will be able to earn their way back to profitability.  A fair and clear system is what everybody is looking for.<br\/><br\/>We need to do a piece of work on the offence of obstructing the sheriff.  We have all seen and heard of repossessions and evictions where garda&iacute; have been present to back up security firms.  We have seen security firms manhandle tenants.  We need to address this.  I accept that the Garda has work to do in maintaining public order but we need to make sure there are also protections for tenants who find themselves in difficult circumstances.  We need to do everything to ensure security firms operate within the law and are subject to sufficient controls and constraints.  Tenants' peace and security can be threatened by eviction.<br\/><br\/>The law needs to protect property rights but we are all aware of the circumstances we are in.  One solution that is required is a moratorium on evictions.  As I said, there are particular worries with regard to businesses and farms.  With anything related to evictions, we need to make sure proper actions are in place.<br\/><br\/>Amendments to the Judicial Council are obviously very important.  It is our role to set rules by which the Judiciary must function in every sense of the word.  The establishment of the Judicial Council and Judicial Appointments Commission are important developments, although we could have done without the various scandals that ensured they were established in the first instance.<br\/><br\/>The amendments are important to enable an independent complaints process to function.  The substitution of another judge where a complaint is made against a judge is a good development.  The real test will come when substantive complaints are made and adjudicated on.  We have all had people contact us with particular complaints.  I will not get into the rights and wrongs in that regard.  The fact is, however, that people sometimes feel hard done by on the basis that we did not have a decent system in place in which they could see there was fairness.  We are trying to put in place a fair system that works for all of us.<br\/><br\/>The Bill relates to the functioning of the courts overall.  It would be remiss of me not to ask what is the status of the Government's review into judicial resources.  The Minister stated earlier accepted that we obviously do not have a fit-for-purpose system in that we have the lowest number of judges <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe.  That needs to be resolved.  For all crimes, from minor offences up to very serious crimes, even when work is done by the Garda to be put in front of a court, it could take three or four years before we see anything happen in the Circuit Court.  That is just not good enough.  Very dangerous criminals will not be remanded in prison for a long time, which can create particular difficulties.  We also know that justice should be swift.  Beyond that, it create difficulties with regard to people who are planning to be witnesses.  It allows time for others to organise impediments to those people following through on giving their testimonies.  We need to ensure this matter is dealt with.  We have massive backlogs and the sooner we deal with them, the better.  We have had significant population growth and we need to do that piece of work in future.  We use the term &quot;workforce planning&quot; with regard to all Departments and sectors at this point.  We do not need to continue with these bottlenecks in judicial resources.  We need to make sure we have enough throughput of judges and whatever other resources are required.<br\/><br\/>Part 6 amends the International Protection Act 2015.  This is to correct a cross-reference and clarify provisions relating to revocation of a protection declaration, including clarifications in relation to Circuit Court jurisdiction and appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  We are facing into a refugee crisis and it is difficult to envisage that it will not be an ongoing crisis.  We are dealing with huge issues with climate change.  There is instability across the world and a large number of places are, were or are still being ravaged by war.  We need to make sure we have the law and the right system in place.  Beyond that, we need to make sure that in our actions, we are providing people with the protections they require when they end up in this country seeking asylum from absolutely dreadful sets of circumstances.  We need to do that because as we face into the very dangerous time ahead, we know certain elements will try to make hay, particularly with regard to issues that relate to refugees.  We must not allow that to happen.  This means providing a proper system.  Beyond that, we must do a wider piece of work to protect the rest of society, some of which I discussed earlier.<br\/><br\/>We support this legislation.  There will be considerable analysis and conversation on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000030#FF01000","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666269300,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I announced earlier that the debate was moving quickly.

It is mostly administrative in nature and while the amendments may appear to be minor, they also make important changes, the majority of which, as Deputy Martin Kenny said, are positive.  In particular, the Bill will help to modernise many of the areas around the administration of the courts.  This will have a real impact because, as we know, delays in the court system cause great stress to people.  A number of the elements of this legislation will also help to reduce costs.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the concerns raised by Deputies Kenny and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about teasing out the role sheriffs will have following the amendments and ensuring the bankruptcy elements of the Bill are effective.  As Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, we want to ensure there is fairness for all here.  The system must be fair, effective and work efficiently but primacy must be given to achieving fairness for those who are going through the system and minimising costs.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debates today and yesterday on the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.<\/p> <p>As the House is aware, miscellaneous Bills such as this one offer an important opportunity to bring legislation up to date and make important technical and policy amendments that do not necessitate their own stand-alone legislation.

The positive changes arising from this Bill will be felt across diverse areas, including bankruptcy, Irish nationality and citizenship, international protection, immigration, legal services, legal aid and the Judicial Council.<\/p> <p> As the Minister outlined, it is intended to table a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage, including those in the areas of occupiers' liability, data protection and third-party funding of commercial arbitration.

Communication, dialogue and engagement are central to a well-functioning democracy and are critical drivers of trust.  The Government needs to be open to outside interests and ideas.  Lobbying is an essential element of the democratic process.  Individuals and organisations legitimately and reasonably want to influence decisions that may affect them.  In turn, the Government needs access to the knowledge and views that lobbying can bring.  Lobbying provides decision-makers with valuable insights, information, policy perspectives, identification of various policy options and debate on those options.  This role is critical, given the complexity of public policy and Government decision-making and the wider impact of government.<\/p>  <p>  The extent of lobbying activity is a good measure of an engaged citizenry.  However, openness and transparency on public policy formulation, development and decision-making are central to effective public governance.  It is crucial that lobbying activity be open to public scrutiny.  That scrutiny is part of the desirable checks and balances that help to ensure that any attempt to seek to exert undue or improper influence on the conduct of policy formulation and development, political decision-making, and preparation and implementing of legislation is discouraged.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will amend the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 in order to build on the current strong legislative foundation and further strengthen Ireland's lobbying laws, thus ensuring that the regulation of lobbying framework remains up to date and fit for purpose.  The Act is viewed internationally as an example of best practice by already regulated systems and those introducing similar laws.  By bolstering our regulation of lobbying regime even further, the Bill will ensure that the regime continues to deliver on the objectives set for it.  I will take this opportunity to acknowledge and commend Deputy Howlin on his work in this regard and on introducing the original legislation in 2015, which was groundbreaking for its time.  The Bill's goal will be to improve the operation and functionality of the lobbying register, strengthen the existing legislation and its enforcement, and make failure to comply with the post-term employment restrictions set out in section 22 of the Act a relevant contravention under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  To date, two statutory reviews have taken place under the 2015 Act - one in 2017 and another in 2019.  In September 2020, I commenced a further review that would examine the operation of the Act, in particular the area that dealt with post-term employment as a lobbyist.  This comprehensive review of the entire Act was concluded in May 2021.  This is a complex policy area and a detailed review was necessary to assess properly the policy, legal and practical implications of the issues raised.  In addition to consultations with the Office of the Attorney General, the review included an assessment of the current operation of key provisions of the Act, consultation with, and consideration of, the views of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, an overview of lobbying regulation in other jurisdictions, and consideration of options to address concerns raised and the policy, legal and practical implications of different responses.  The core consideration was to examine how the existing solid legislative foundation could be enhanced most effectively and efficiently, strengthening weaknesses that had been identified.  On foot of the review, a number of recommendations were brought forward for legislative change.<\/p>  <p>  The key elements of reform in this Bill will allow for the following changes to be made to the Act: to extend the time period between statutory reviews from three to five years to allow for the impacts of any policy or legislative change to become clear; to bring certain business groupings with no employees within the scope of the Act and require that members of such groups be named on lobbying returns to ensure the groups do not avoid the requirement to register; to extend the Act's scope to include non-remunerated officeholders to capture all relevant lobbying activity; to provide for an exemption from registration for communications made by political parties to their members who are designated public officials, DPOs, only in their capacity as members of their respective parties; to introduce legislative provisions to improve the operation of the lobbying register; to introduce a new \"relevant contravention\" in the Act, covering the taking of any action by a person that has the intended purpose of avoiding the obligations to register or submit lobbying returns to the commission; and to amend the Act to make failure to comply with the cooling-off provisions of section 22 of the Act a relevant contravention under the Act.  In this regard, a system of administrative sanctions operated by SIPO will be introduced.  This system will involve minor or major sanctions.  The sanctions proposed include a caution or reprimand, a monetary penalty of up to &euro;25,000 and a prohibition from lobbying of up to two years.  They set out clear timelines in the Act for the processing of section 22 applications made to SIPO by former relevant DPOs.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the development of the Bill, I thank the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach for its careful consideration of the general scheme of the Bill during pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and other members of the committee made thoughtful contributions during that process.  I welcome their input into the development of the Bill.  While broadly supportive of the measures proposed in the general scheme, the committee made seven recommendations, which my Department has considered in detail.  Four of those recommendations require clarifications and a commitment to ensure sufficient capacity to implement any changes, which has been communicated to the committee.  The remaining recommendations, if adopted, would give rise to significant legal and policy issues and I have responded to the committee directly on them.  I thank the members again for their very thorough and comprehensive report, which clearly reflects the strong engagement and interest they have in this topic.  Should the Bill be successful on Second Stage, I look forward to engaging in detail with colleagues from the committee in regard to any amendments they wish to put forward on the next Stage.<\/p> <p> I will briefly go through each section of the Bill, outlining its content and purpose.  As this is amending legislation, some sections need to be read in conjunction with the principal Act.  A number of sections are also technical in nature.  If any Member feels a technical briefing on the Bill would be helpful, I will make my officials available to assist in this regard.<\/p> <p> Section 1 identifies the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 as the principal Act being amended.<\/p> <p> Section 2 provides for an amendment to allow for the period between statutory reviews of the Act to be extended from three to five years.<\/p> <p> Section 3 amends the provisions relating to regulations made under the Act, consequent on further amendments allowing SIPO to make regulations.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides for an extension of the definition of lobbying in regard to the development or zoning of land, certain informal business groups, non-remunerated office holders and communications made by a political party to its members.<\/p> <p> Section 5 inserts a definition of \"company\" into the Act.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides for a prohibition on registered persons from lobbying where they have notified the commission that they have ceased to carry on lobbying activities.<\/p> <p> Section 7 amends the provisions dealing with certain details to be supplied by applicants who wish to be included on the lobbying register, including, for example, that persons applying for registration must give the name of every person who is a member of an informal business group.<\/p> <p> Section 8 amends the provisions relating to the returns made by registered persons.<\/p> <p> Section 9 makes amendments regarding relevant contraventions by introducing new relevant contraventions for certain persons.

It is welcome that we are discussing the regulation of lobbying.  We need to be realistic about this.  People's faith in the public and political system is at an all-time low.  That is because of the behaviour of certain people.  When people look at this Chamber and the debates that take place here, even though numbers of them voted for every one of us, they do not feel they have the same level of influence on their locally elected politicians as certain specific interests may have.  It is important for us as elected representatives to realise that.  It does not mean everybody in this Chamber is engaged in any kind of activity or anything like that.  The point is that if this is the perception out there, then it is something we need to face head on and tackle.<\/p>  <p>  Two years ago, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, and I brought forward the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020, which would have done much of what SIPO had asked to be enacted.  I was only elected a few months at that point and a number of scandals had already hit that totally eroded people's trust and confidence in public and political life.  While I welcome this discussion and the fact the Minister is moving on the issue, I am bitterly disappointed that when my colleagues and I brought forward our Bill two years ago, in September 2020, instead of supporting it, the Government decided to kick the can down the road.  It is not good enough that we are only now discussing the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes, when we look at how things work in other countries, we may think to ourselves that at least we are not as bad as they are at this moment in time.  We can all bring such a comparison to mind today.  However, when we look at the issue of lobbying in this country, my concern is that it is only going to get worse, not only in terms of the public perception but also in respect of the influence certain vested interests have.  The Legislature is supposed to agree and enact legislation that is of benefit to the vast majority of people.  It is not there to facilitate certain key interests.  We must bear this in mind when looking at the great issues of the day.<\/p> <p>At this moment in time, people are really suffering because the legislation has not been there to benefit the majority of people.  A lot of the time, that is the actual crux of the issue for me.<\/p> <p> I look forward to engaging on this particular legislation at committee level.  I must say it has been very good that we have been able to engage constructively with the Minister at committee level.  The Minister has taken on a lot of the different suggestions that we have made over a period of time.  I hope to see that, and I am sure that I will see it, with this particular legislation.<\/p> <p> There are a number of issues I want raise in particular.  One of them is the cooling-off period, which caused one of the many scandals that we have seen in lobbying.  It is definitely one of the main rules with which we can close that revolving door.  It is there to prevent former insiders from being able to trade on their influence.  As we know, under the current rules, there is no sanction for breaching the one-year cooling-off period.  I believe the current period of one year is too short.  It is clear from international best practice that a two-year period is seen as being absolutely crucial.  We know that SIPO has called for a such a period of time.  When we had a discussion on lobbying previously within our own committee, that is what the experts recommended.  It is also what the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach recommended.  It is also exactly what the Bill I brought forward two years ago would have done.  It is an issue we can discuss further on Committee Stage.  We will thrash it out.  However, I think it is unfortunate that at this point the Bill will not extend that period to two years.<\/p> <p> We are finally going to see a breach of the cooling-off period being made an offence.  I absolutely welcome that.  I must say it is startling that it was not there initially.  I just do not understand how it could have happened that a breach of that period was not made an offence.  I cannot understand that, especially given that SIPO has told us time and again that it needs to happen.  There has been failure to act for years.  It is good that it is going to be included in the legislation, but how it got to this point is beyond me.  What is the point in having a cooling-off period if there is no sanction for disregarding it?  Under the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, a breach of the cooling-off period would have been a criminal offence.  That is exactly what SIPO recommended.  Unfortunately, the Government has gone for a lesser sanction in the form of a civil sanction.  We will discuss that on Committee Stage, and I look forward to that discussion.  To be honest, my fear is that it is not a strong enough deterrent.  That is my concern at this point.  We know that under the legislation, certain people will be granted special exemptions from the cooling-off period.  I am concerned that the Government is not going to require the names of those who are granted special exemptions to this cooling-off period to be made public.  They should be made public so that it is very clear to people exactly who has been granted special exemptions.  I must say I am not sure why that is not being done.  We know that SIPO has been allowed to publish these details in the same way that we know that the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has also called for it, and my own Bill has provided for it.  It is really crucial.  It is definitely something that I would ask the Minister to look at.  I think that could be good.<\/p> <p> One of the things I have never understood since being elected to this House is how previous Members are permitted special access all the time.  It is something I just cannot comprehend.  It means that if I were to lose my seat overnight, and I am sure Deputies would be devastated if that happened, I would still have access.  I think it is outrageous that former Members can become lobbyists and have access.  At the end of the day, there is a particular reason we talk about the corridors of power.  It is something we definitely need to look at.  We know that the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach specifically recommended that this be removed.  It is something that needs to be looked at.  To be honest, I think if people were aware of it, they would really be astonished.<\/p> <p> I also want to mention the Government's decision to extend the review period from three to five years.  The Minister mentioned it in his speech.  He might even pick up on it later or we can discuss it again at committee level.  The review period is being changed from three to five years.  My concern in relation to that is that lobbying activities and tactics change all the time.  A few years ago, nobody knew that there would be such a thing as the Internet.  We know the confusion and difficulties that can cause.  I think we need a shorter review period so that we can move with the times.  That is where my concern is in relation to that.  We need to be agile to move with the times.  Things can change very quickly in this area.  It seems to me that if we are extending the review period, we are making it less reactive than it could be.<\/p> <p> I hate using the phrase because it is so overused, but I think this is a missed opportunity.  I believe the Minister fully understands the issues that have been noted with regard to the Regulation of Lobbying Act for a long time.  He is clearly willing to make amendments to strengthen it, but this Bill really does not go far enough.  There is a lot of work to be done on Committee Stage to strengthen it.  The committee will come together and it will be done.  We debated the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill on lobbying.  I think that was a stronger Bill and it would have been better if that Bill had been enacted, particularly given that it was two years ago and so many different things have happened since then.  We could have done with a strengthened lobbying Bill.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, my core point is that we need to make this Bill as strong as possible so that we can restore confidence in public and political life and, crucially, make sure all the decisions that are made at every level within this Chamber are made for the benefit of the vast majority of people.  We must ensure no one can say at any point that decisions were made just for a few because certain people had certain access and were able to use that access to influence decision-making.  We are here for the vast majority of people. We need to recognise that and we need to have a lobbying Bill that is as strong as possible to ensure that remains the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000033#JJ00200","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666271100,"counter":386,"content":"<p>The point Deputy Farrell made is the reason we are here and we are dealing with the whole issue of lobbying.  In fairness, the Minister spoke about the necessity for openness and transparency.  We have to do absolutely everything we can from the point of view of delivering that as it relates to politics, political operations and parliamentary operations for that matter.  We often talk about the revolving door in politics, big business and lobbying in general.  We have all known and dealt with certain instances where it has actually happened.  I think there is a feeling out there that some people are more connected.  I accept Deputy Farrell's point about looking across the water.  There is chaos there currently, but we have also heard stories of people having absolute access to the top end of government.  It seems to have ended in chaos.  That is not even a strong enough word for it.  We definitely do not need to be going in any way in that direction, so we have to provide whatever protections we can.  European Commission Vice President V\u011bra Jourov&aacute; was actually in this House last week to attend meetings of the Joint Committee on Justice and the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.<\/p> <p>Steps need to be taken throughout the EU, particularly by countries that are wildly in breach of the rule of law, best practice and what we would perceive as common decency.  There is, therefore, also a necessity for the rest of us to adhere to our obligations under the rule of law.  One of the issues is that we need to deal with these particular issues because there is a revolving door.  We need to  make sure proper protections and mechanisms to ensure that we do not have that a free flow between politics, big business and lobbying.<\/p> <p> Much of what is in this Bill is welcome.  I do not think anyone will have a major difficulty with the registration of all members of business groups.  I welcome the fact that there is a sanction for those who are in breach of the cooling-off period.  I agree with Deputy Farrell, and the legislation she looked to introduce.  An awful lot of the best practice we are told about talks about a two-year cooling-off period as more applicable.  The fact is that we are talking about a &euro;25,000 sanction, which is not nothing.  On Committee Stage, we may have to deal with the fact that it may not be enough.  We must examine that.  It is a civil sanction and perhaps it would be better for it to be a criminal sanction.  All of that needs to be talked out because we must ensure that even if we are late to the game, we put our best play in force from here on in.  That is necessary.  I support an approach whereby anyone found to be in breach of these rules would be prohibited from lobbying for at least two years.<\/p> <p> We must ensure that where somebody is given a special exemption from the cooling-off period, that should be made public.  That fits into the idea of openness and transparency.  If such an exemption is allowed, that information should be freely available and open.  If there is a reason for such an exemption, there is nothing to hide.<\/p> <p> The privilege of access to the House for former Oireachtas Members has been mentioned.  That could create difficulty if I were to lose my seat and my parking space in Dublin.  I am sure the people of County Louth would find that difficult to get over.  In fairness, there are serious issues in that regard.  We accept that the job all of us do is privileged.  The Minister has an even more privileged position.  It is necessary that we provide protections for people.  In some cases, there is a perception that some people do not have the same powers as others and lack that level of connectivity.  In some cases, there is also the reality.  Whatever we have to do to stop that must be done.  That is what we are asking for.  Most decent people want fairness.  They want politicians to get on with politics.  They have no difficulty, and none of us have, with businesses lobbying.  They have a right to do that.  However, we need to ensure it is all done within a fair system.  There has been enormous unfairness to many people over many years so we need those protections.  We also need to consider the review period and the length of time involved.  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p> I accept, as I do in respect of every piece of legislation and system that is put in place, there will always be a need for further amendments and review.  I hope we will be able to work with the Minister to put a best practice system in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000034#KK00200","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1666271700,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1666271700,"counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000035#LL00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1666271700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 37 and the name of the Member in each case:<\/p><p>Deputy Brian Stanley - to discuss the budget allocated for the provision of a domestic violence refuge accommodation centre in Laois.<\/p><p>Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan - to discuss the activities of the Office of the Planning Regulator within various county and city development plans.<\/p><p>Deputy Jackie Cahill  - to discuss flooding issues in Thurles and the inadequate wastewater treatment and flood relief infrastructure in the town.<\/p><p>Deputy Gary Gannon - to discuss the RT&Eacute; &quot;Prime Time&quot; documentary on O'Connell Street and the city of Dublin.<\/p><p>Deputy Bernard J.

A glance at the monitor told me we are probably two hours ahead of where we expected to be.  On that basis, I am unlikely to use the full 20 minutes apportioned to me, but we will see how I get on.<\/p>  <p>  These are welcome proposals.  They have been evolving now for some time and many of them are based on recommendations that were made by SIPO over several years.  The Labour Party is proud of our function in improving the ethical framework within which politics takes place and democratic engagement occurs in this country.  We introduced reforms between 2011 and 2016 and one of those reforms, of course, was the development and introduction of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015.  That legislation is objectively considered, in international terms, reasonably robust.  It has served this country and its democracy well.  It is important that lobbying is done in a transparent way.  We all, as practising politicians, understand, I hope, the difference between lobbying and advocacy.  Some people believe they are one and the same thing.  One person's lobbyist is another person's advocate.  We have all benefited over the years from insights that have been provided to us by those who are advocating for change and perhaps showing us an alternative proposition or a different way of doing things.  That is as it should be in a democracy.  The legislation should not necessarily be about restricting lobbyists but rather it ought to address what they lobby about, how they do it, and the public understanding of how they do it and how transparent that is.  We have a regime that works reasonably well.  That said, it is, of course, high time that elements of the provisions of the legislation that could be improved are improved and that is what the legislation before us seeks to do.<\/p>  <p>  We know from the experience of the past seven years that there are gaps that the practical application of the legislation has identified.  We, as practising politicians and public representatives, know that.  High-profile issues have emerged in recent years, especially around, for example, the cooling-off period and the revolving door that appears to exist between some former Ministers and private industry and those who lobby on its behalf.  It is important that we update our laws to reflect public concerns about that, and the Minister is doing just that.  I am pleased with the amendments to section 22 in respect of the cooling-off period, the making of a breach of that cooling-off period a contravention and the introduction of sanctions for those who contravene it.  It would be fair to say that is modelled on some proposals in the regulation of lobbying (post-term employment as lobbyists) Bill that the Labour Party published and brought forward, and that was discussed on Second Stage some time ago.  That is very welcome indeed.  That is a key point on which we must focus.  We will table amendments to further tighten that section on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that the law is tightened in respect of communication and lobbying around development land and zoned land.  That is an obvious issue.  Of course, many of the proposals that were adopted by successive Governments relating to the ethical framework within which we all operate emerged from proposals and recommendations made by the Mahon tribunal.  The language used in the context of that particular provision is interesting and welcome.  That is an obvious part of the legislation that required to be tightened.<\/p>  <p>  One of the flaws, if I can describe it as such, in the 2015 legislation was the inability of the SIPO to initiate investigations.<\/p> <p>The requirement has been that an individual citizen could make a complaint and then an examination of the issues and an investigation could occur.  Some of those issues, gaps or <i>lacunae<\/i>are being addressed and that is very important indeed.  This legislation will also enable the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, to regulate and introduce regulations and frameworks themselves to be able to modernise the way in which they work.<br\/><br\/>When we are talking about sanctions regimes it is important that any administrative sanctions' process is robust, transparent, properly resourced and constitutional.  The legislation clearly sets out a step-by-step approach that would be taken by the Standards in Public Office Commission in investigating breaches and contraventions of the legislation around, for example, the cooling off period.  There is a right for those who are accused of a contravention to be heard.  The idea of an oral hearing is important and that complies with the Law Reform Commission of Ireland proposals around the proper administration of justice, if we can call it that.  We should be mindful of the Zalewski case, which is reflected in the way in which this legislation will ask SIPO to go about its business in terms of examination of issues, investigations and, ultimately, sanctions.<br\/><br\/>I am interested and note that section 17 refers to the fact that the commission must apply to the Circuit Court for confirmation of a decision to impose major sanctions.  That to some degree aligns with the principles that are established in the individual accountability Bill from the Minister of Finance that we debated in the Chamber yesterday.  I note, however, that there is no requirement under this legislation to seek confirmation from the High Court, but from the Circuit Court.  I am interested to establish from the Minister why that is the case.  Why the Circuit Court and not the High Court?  In fact, is there any necessity at all to do this?  Does it make it any more bulletproof from constitutional challenge if it would otherwise be the case?  It is a well-established principle, legal precedent and convention that administrative tribunals can introduce sanctions once things are done correctly in procedure.  All these procedures are now set out in law in terms of how the Standards in Public Office Commission would go about an investigation and impose sanctions.  Why is it the case, given that we have confidence in the Standards in Public Office Commission to do the job it has been asked to do?  It is legally and constitutionally robust in terms of what it is we are asking it to do.  Why then is it the case that sanctions of certain kinds would have to be confirmed by the Circuit Court?  Why is it the case that the Circuit Court is the court of choice here and not the High Court, as is the case for the operation of the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, legislation?<br\/><br\/>I am also interested and note that it was the view of the committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny on the question of waivers from the 12-month cooling off period that a decision has been made in annual reports to aggregate the number of requests that were made and the number of requests that might have been processed by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  It may well be in the public interest that the Standards in Public Office Commission should instead publish the details of the individual requests, while anonymising insofar as we can the individuals involved because they are entitled to go about their business as they are private citizens at that point in time.  We should acknowledge that the reason they are seeking an exemption from the cooling-off period and a waiver is that they held a different position until relatively recently before they had to make that request.<br\/><br\/>That being said, at the same time, the legislation needs to be balanced and proportionate.  We have had lengthy debates in this Chamber and the committee has had lengthy debates which are in fact reflected in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report that the cooling-off period should be extended to 24 months.  There are differences of opinion on that.  Frankly, from my own point of view, from the perspective of natural justice and the perspective of somebody's ability to make a living, which they are entitled to do, the 12-month period is probably about right.  I have no difficulty with the 12-month period, especially based on the fact that the legislation is being tightened up.  There always would have been a concern that legislation like this may be vulnerable to challenge, but the approach that is being taken in this Bill is balanced and proportionate.  It balances all the interests that need to be balanced on a constitutional basis.  It is positive in that regard and it ought not to be vulnerable to any challenge.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude on this point.  Legislation like this is very important to ensure that we maintain trust in democracy, in politics and in our institutions.  Trust in democracy and democracy itself are delicate flowers.  The way in which lobbying now occurs has changed even fundamentally to when this legislation was first introduced in 2015.  It is evolving all the time.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the provision for statutory reviews on a five-year frequency.  There will be a requirement to review the legislation, insofar as I can recall, after a year.  Yet, the five-year frequency in my view is far too long, given the nature of lobbying, the way in which it is changing and the different ways in which people can access public representatives and data protection officers more generally these days.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that.<br\/><br\/>Broadly speaking, the Labour Party supports this legislation.  It is a timely set of propositions to enhance the legislation that was brought in in 2015.  There is considerable learning from the experience of the operation of the legislation since 2015.  They are largely reflected in this and I am happy to work with the Minister to strengthen the legislation on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000035#LL00600","speaker":"1599","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666272300,"counter":395,"content":"<p>In broad terms, I welcome this legislation, but as other speakers have said, I hope the Minister will be open to amending the legislation to strengthen it, because I feel that it does not go anywhere near far enough.  There is an onus on us to clean up our own house.  As a body, we have been remiss in doing that.  There has not been the required sense of urgency following various scandals that have broken in this country.  If we are going to do it, we should be doing it right.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish political system is undoubtedly in need of reform.  The standards written in law and ethical conduct are falling far short of what is needed to protect Government decision-making from being unduly influenced by the interests of well-connected individuals and organisations.  Despite the introduction of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, a cloak of secrecy persists in public life here.  Sure, our regime looks pretty robust on paper.  In fact, Ireland tends to be placed high among jurisdictions internationally, but when you take a deeper look the cracks in the Irish system become all too apparent.  As the Oireachtas Library and Research Service notes, care should always be taken with interpreting international rankings on lobbying.  These overall scores do not always reflect the possibility that one weakness can render the strengths of other regime futile.<\/p>  <p>  In the Irish context, there are a number of weaknesses which undermine our regime, including inadequate enforcement, the question of access to Leinster House and its environs and financial disclosures, to name but a few.  While some of these shortcomings would be addressed by this legislation, I firmly believe that to place a clear demarcation between the political arena and lobbying, we must go further than what is currently proposed here.  I believe the approach outlined in this Bill is too narrow to deal effectively with the major issues in politics and in Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth casting our minds back to the events that prompted the introduction of the lobbying register in 2015, namely, the infamous Mahon Tribunal on planning corruption.  Among the many recommendations in that final report was the regulation of lobbying activities.  I mention the origins of the primary legislation because it highlights how little things have changed.  We debate this legislation in the midst of yet another planning scandal.<\/p>  <p>The chaos engulfing An Bord Plean&aacute;la as we speak is seriously damaging trust in the planning system all over again.  This shambles will also have major cost implications for the State.  You would think that, after the longest running and most expensive public inquiry in Irish history, which I repeat was about planning matters, the Government would have learned some further lessons.  However, it appears that some Government parties are determined to go down the well-trodden path of their predecessors, despite the well-known pitfalls and gaps that undoubtedly exist.  <\/p> <p> Even before the current crisis in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Social Democrats were blue in the face from pointing out issues in the planning system.  We know that successive housing Ministers have been vigorously lobbied by the likes of the Construction Industry Federation and Irish Institutional Property.  We know from lobbying records the number of occasions on which those bodies and other lobbying organisations were in and out of this House and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is an indication of the level of influence they brought to bear on decisions being taken by that Department.  To a large extent, it is these types of powerful groups that shape housing and planning policy in this country.  How else could damaging interventions in the planning system such as mandatory section 28 planning guidelines, build-to-rent regulations and strategic housing development, SHD, policy be explained?  Some of these are now being reversed by the Government but, in most cases, it is too late.  <\/p> <p> It seems the Government has finally realised that allowing developers, landlords and vulture funds to determine planning policy will not fix the housing crisis.  However, as I said, it is very late in the day for that penny to drop.  These moves have been portrayed as a complete reversal of those past mistakes and a lot has been pledged under the general banner of removing provision for SHDs but, of course, that is only part of the story.  In many respects, the mandatory guidelines are hamstringing planning decisions from the professional planners in our local authorities and from the democratic decision-making process that should determine what is regarded as appropriate planning in local areas.  Mandatory guidelines, which arguably represent the most egregious change to our planning laws, remain a feature of the Government's planning policy.  One has to ask why that is the case.  In my view, it is because this Government continues to parrot the line industry lobbyists have fed it for years, which is that apartments were not commercially viable under previous standards.  It is safe to say that the champions of the current housing market have all but captured the planning policy space.  Why has this happened?  It is because of the insidious nature of the relationship between these lobbyists and political decision makers which, unfortunately, will not be changed or stymied by the Bill.<\/p> <p> I will return to the legislation before us and speak to some of its principal provisions.  The amendments to section 5 of the principal Act seek to widen the scope of the definition of a person engaged in lobbying activity.  I welcome the provisions that would deal with loopholes in the current definition, specifically the inclusion of representative bodies irrespective of the number or status of employees.  In 2019, SIPO identified a number of representative bodies \"that exist primarily to advocate on behalf of their members, but which do not have full-time employees and are therefore not captured by the Act\".  This loophole seriously undercuts transparency and accountability in the current regime and, therefore, I am pleased to see it addressed in the Bill.  I also welcome the considered wording that avoids unintentionally capturing smaller local interest groups.<\/p> <p> I am underwhelmed by the amendments that relate to cooling-off periods.  Transparency International Ireland, along with the joint committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report, recommended extending the cooling-off period for designated public officials to two years.  I agree wholeheartedly with this recommendation as the current system is simply not rigorous enough.  I accept that restrictions on the rights of individuals to employment and a livelihood are not, in themselves, desirable but the public interest and the need for a clear dividing line between the political arena and lobbying must trump concerns about individual rights.  The one-year cooling-off period has not prevented the almost seamless movement of high-ranking individuals between the public and private sectors.  Not only is this bad governance, but it fuels distrust in the political system and gives many individuals unfair and undue access and influence.  I, therefore, strongly urge the Minister to consider extending the cooling-off period to two years.  I am sure many of us will propose amendments to that effect.  I ask him to consider all that has gone before, the general public attitude to lobbying and the sense that, in this country, a lot depends on who you know and your connections.  The strongly prevailing view about how things work in this country is that it is about who you know and the access you have.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this aspect and to consider proposing an amendment to extend this period to two years.<\/p> <p> The amendment to section 22, which makes breaches of the cooling-off provision and the anti-avoidance clause relevant contraventions, will certainly enhance the effectiveness of the regime.  However, rather than treating these relevant contraventions in the same way as those in place, the Bill would create a new regime of administrative sanctions.  This decision has raised some eyebrows.  I am particularly concerned about the designation of breaches of the cooling-off provisions as civil offences.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, both SIPO and Transparency International Ireland expressed doubts about SIPO's ability to impose these sanctions.  As the Bill digest outlines, a regulator needs both legal power and capacity to enforce provisions.  SIPO currently does not have the resources to carry out this function, especially when the Bill precludes any member of staff other than commissioners from imposing financial sanctions.  <\/p> <p> The Social Democrats have long called for an independent anti-corruption agency and we are once again repeating that call.  Along with strengthening ethics and transparency in public life, such an independent agency would assume the anti-corruption remit of SIPO and the Register of Lobbying.  The Social Democrats tabled a motion proposing the establishment of this kind of agency almost seven years ago but the then Fine Gael-Labour Government rejected it.  Had our proposal been supported, we could have had an agency up and running by now with the appropriate resources and powers to make a real difference.  We researched this issue quite extensively and, subsequent to our motion, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, proposed that we needed such an agency.  Indeed, the T&aacute;naiste did at one stage as well.  We have to face up to the fact that we do not have a mechanism to ensure accountability where there is wrongdoing, in which I include white-collar crime but wrongdoing relating to public bodies in particular.  Inevitably, when wrongdoing is uncovered, we end up having expensive investigations, inquiries and tribunals that go on for a long time but that end up making findings that cannot then be used to prosecute the individuals against whom they are made.  This is sometimes even worse than doing nothing because the public expect that, at the end of the process, people will be brought to book and that there will be consequences.<\/p> <p>Frequently, there are no consequences.  That undermines our governance systems.  Having a single agency with the powers of the Garda and powers of investigation, enforcement and prosecution is the key thing that is needed.  The model is there in the Criminal Assets Bureau, for example.  For years there was a disconnect between what Revenue knew, what the Garda knew and what the Department responsible for social welfare knew.  It is about bringing the different agencies together and ensuring an agency like that has the power to examine the wrongdoing from the very beginning to the final imposition of sanctions.  That is a big lack in this country.<\/p> <p> Reading the Minister's proposal I can only conclude that this new regime of sanctions is being set up to fail.  Why has the Minister not responded to SIPO's concerns?  I would again argue that the common good has to trump any concerns regarding an individual's right to employment.  Furthermore, this distinction between criminal and civil offences implies that breaches of the cooling-off period are somehow less serious.  That does not sound like a healthy democracy to me.<\/p> <p> While we are on the topic of public representatives moving into lobbying, I stress the need to end the revolving door between politics and private business.  In recent years, there have been several high-profile examples of ministerial advisers and, indeed, Ministers, moving into the private sector and then often back into the public sector again.  There have also been examples of Ministers of State, including some very recent ones, moving into jobs in sectors of the economy for which they previously had responsibility.  The Social Democrats recommend taking the separation of politics and lobbying further than is currently the case.  At present, the rules of the Oireachtas allow all former Members - Deputies and Senators - perpetual access to the Leinster House complex.  This is a huge privilege and should not be taken away lightly.  However, it has allowed an insidious situation to develop whereby several former Deputies and Senators use that privilege to gain undue access to sitting Ministers and other influential Members of these Houses.  This is particularly the case with ex-Ministers, who we frequently see swanning around the corridors of this complex, giving them easy access to existing Ministers, Deputies and Senators.<\/p> <p> I had an experience a few months ago when we were talking about legislation relating to an environmental matter, although I will not say what it was.  We were debating that legislation and it went on over a long period.  People were going in and out to the bar, not necessarily to drink but because there was a series of votes taking place and they were waiting for that.  There was one ex-Member of this House, who is now a senior lobbyist in the relevant area, sitting at the bar counter chatting and buying drinks for Members.  That just should not be allowed.  Once an ex-Member of this House becomes a lobbyist, he or she should forfeit the right of access to this House.  I urge the Minister to take that point on board.  We cannot have this happening.  I see it on a regular basis on budget day with various ex-Members getting the ear of the Minister.  That needs to stop and I will certainly be putting down an amendment to that effect.  Where someone takes up a role as a lobbyist, there is no doubt that person must forfeit access to this House.  He or she must be treated like any other member of society.<\/p> <p> I would make a few points about other aspects of this Bill.  There is a real case for requiring those engaged in lobbying activities to disclose expenditure on lobbying.  As John Devitt, chief executive of Transparency International Ireland, outlined in his evidence to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, \"the Act does little to meet its first objective of preventing corruption unless there is a corresponding requirement to disclose not just the source but the amounts of funding received\".  If this Government is serious about transparency and open government, then we must recognise the huge advantages larger lobbying budgets bestow and ensure that the lobbying register takes account of that.<\/p> <p> I also draw the Minister's attention to another planning matter that should be addressed in this legislation but is currently not.  As I outlined earlier, repeat planning scandals have emphasised the need for robust lobbying and anti-corruption legislation.  However, the then Minister over-corrected somewhat in the 2015 Act.  I am referring to the provision relating to the development and zoning of land, which will be further broadened by this Bill.  I would be the first to come into this Chamber and call for stricter measures to protect the integrity of the planning process but the provisions of the primary legislation and what is proposed in this Bill are too restrictive.  SIPO and the joint committee share this view and I fully support their recommendation to limit the Act's scope to persons who have a material interest in relation to the development of land or zoning.  When local residents contact me or any other representative about proposed developments or a potential rezoning, it is primarily about local amenities and infrastructure, not because they have a material interest in the land.  These are ordinary citizens who contact their public representatives, not cosy insiders who enjoy influence over the Government.  As SIPO pointed out in its 2019 review submission, under the current Act a person complaining about proposed zoning to a designated public official during a canvass could be regarded as carrying out a lobbying activity.  That does not make any sense.<\/p> <p> Cronyism and old-style politics are very much still alive and well.  We need to go further than the provisions in this Bill if we are serious about dealing with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000036#MM00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666273500,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I was listening to the Minister's introduction upstairs.  It struck me that there is a fundamental difference between the Minister's view of lobbying and People Before Profit's view of lobbying.  That explains why we have quite a limited reform here.  It is a tiny step in the right direction but is quite limited and inadequate.  The Minister said that lobbying is an invaluable part of politics which provides an invaluable insight for politicians about the details and workings of things and so on.  He really extolled the virtues of lobbying.  Fundamentally, I do not agree with that.  Part of how that case is made is by throwing it all in together.  The football club that contacts a Deputy or a councillor about a pitch that needs to get fixed is put in the same category as the major multinational corporation paying tens or hundreds of thousands of euro to former Deputies or Ministers to lobby for changes in their interests.  They are not the same thing.  They are fundamentally different.  There is something fundamentally different between the kind of campaigning and informing done by ordinary people, community groups, sports groups, trade unionists, etc., and what makes up the vast majority of lobbying as a business.  We have to remember that that is what this is.<\/p>  <p>  Lobbying is a multibillion euro industry on an EU-wide basis, and a multimillion euro industry in this country.  The purpose of that lobbying, which, again, is the vast majority of the lobbying by value and in terms of the money spent on these things, is to shape laws in the interests of particular, defined and discrete business interests to try to make sure their interests are represented.  They spend money on this, billions of euro on a worldwide basis, because they think it works.  If they did not think it worked in shaping laws, they would not spend the money.<\/p> <p>One must presume that these individuals, who are hard-headed business people, have the evidence to show that it is worth spending multiple millions of euro or dollars to get their way and that it has an impact, in that the legislation that results in the areas of the environment, labour, planning and consumer rights is, at least to some degree, affected and shaped in the interests of those who are paying to try to do so.  That is fundamentally undemocratic.  It is fundamentally about those who have economic power using that economic power to ensure they also have political power.  This is not something that is open to community groups, local residents in an area, trade unionists and ordinary people.  The difference is that these people have the money to spend millions on lobbyists.  This is why I take a much more dim view of the role of lobbying in this political system.<\/p> <p> It was Connolly who wrote that \"governments in capitalist society are but committees of the rich to manage the affairs of the capitalist class\".  The right-wing governments that generally pursue the interests of managing the affairs of the rich, the 1% in our societies, do not necessarily know the exact details of what different sections of the capitalist class want.  The role of lobbying is, fundamentally, to inform them of that.  It is to transmit the direct interests of big business to government.<\/p> <p> I have made this point here before but it bears repeating.  There is a reason the lobbying companies to employ former Ministers and former Deputies as lobbyists.  I mean no offence to the people individually, but it is not because they have particular aptitudes or intelligence set up for lobbying.  That is not the reason.  Very clearly, the reason is precisely because they are former Ministers or Deputies, political insiders who have access both physically and metaphorically.  It is worth pointing out that if the lobbying companies did not think it was worth their money to employ former politicians, they would not do it.  They obviously feel that this access means something.<\/p> <p> Let us consider the examples.  Brian Hayes went from being a Fine Gael MEP to the head of the banking lobbyists organisation.  Even more blatantly, Michael D'Arcy went from being the Minister of State with responsibility for the financial sector to being the CEO of the Irish Association of Investment Managers.  There is a reason those people are chosen.  It is not a personal criticism of those people to say that it is not about some inherent talent or skill.  It is about the job they previously had and, therefore, the access.  The point is that when the Government-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000038#OO00200","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666274100,"counter":400,"content":"<p>The Deputy may not name people who are not in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000039#PP00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1666274100,"counter":401,"content":"<p>To be clear, I am not making any personal charge.  I am just giving a description of the jobs the individuals in question had and now have, and it is 100% accurate.  For example, when they sit down across the table from the Government, which has Fine Gael in it, it clearly suits the banks to have on their side a former senior member of Fine Gael.  That clearly suits their interests and clearly greases the wheels of communications.  The social dialogue, the chats, the informal access, and all of that, are made easier by having a former senior politician on one's side.<\/p><p>The point about physical access was well made by Deputy Shortall.  It is a fact that there are lobbyists who are allowed to drive in through the front gates of our national Parliament, park their cars alongside Deputies and Senators, get out of their cars together, have a chat about the weather, politics and what is happening and, while they are it, say &quot;Oh, could I just ask about that and how is that going?&quot;  That is entirely inappropriate.  It is a distortion of any basic idea of what democracy is supposed to look like.<\/p><p>There was an example a couple of years ago.  I will not name the person but a former press secretary took up a role with public relations company.  This person was reported to be repeatedly asking the Fine Gael Chairman of the climate committee for details of private deliberations on what was described as a controversial Bill to ban oil and gas exploration.  This is according to Hugh O'Connell in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>in 2019.  The Bill in question was the Planning and Development (Climate Emergency Measures) (Amendment) Bill 2021, which was introduced by People Before Profit to ban oil and gas exploration licences.  Again, the revolving door was being used to get access to get information to pursue, in this case, the interests of the fossil fuel industry, which is certainly among one of the most destructive, damaging and evil industries in our society.<\/p><p>No one else can have these types of access, which are bought and paid for and are not accessible to ordinary people.  I gave the example at the time of the so-called &quot;Leo the leak&quot; scandal when there was ready access to the T&aacute;naiste by the head of the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, while, at the same time, paramedics organised in the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, who were on a picket line seeking to be recognised and dealt with, were not able to get the sort of access that the NAGP was able to get.  All of that is without even dealing with all of the other old boys' network that exist - the clubs, debating societies and social circles within which Ireland's elite circulate, meet and decide what is in the best interests of the &quot;nation&quot;.  The reality is that some lobbyists will always have preferential access to and influence on the political elite and the senior civil servants they meet.<\/p><p>Let us take the role of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, which is on the public record.  The CIF lobbied for the first-time buyer's scheme.  That is in their documents.  It appeared at the time as a mechanism for getting homes for first-time buyers.  In the Government's presentation, who could possibly object to that?  Of course, the role of the CIF is not to lobby in the interests of first-time buyers but to lobby in the interests of the construction industry in order to maximise its profits.  That was the purpose of the scheme.  It was called the help-to-buy scheme but in reality it is a help-to-profit scheme.  The CIF has even been given quasi-statutory functions with the recent register relating to building standards.  Clearly, what it says has significantly more impact on the Government and senior civil servants than, for example, what trade union officials might say.<\/p><p>There are continuous revolving doors from Government to private lobbying and representative organisations, which are effectively lobbying organisations.  The same thing applies with civil servants.  There was a recent article on this recently in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  I will not name the people but 11 key officials who left NAMA went with their contacts and phone numbers into private real estate work or related firms.  None of that is deemed to be corrupt.  None of it would breach the Lobbying Act, either as it is now or as it will be.  It is, however, a small example of how Ireland works.  People ask how we could have the kind of society we have, how one of the richest countries in the world has health and education crises and a complete absence of action on climate change, how we got here and how we can have this tax haven system.  Part of the answer is the massive influence that the top 1% have on politics in this country.  This is part of how that is expressed.<\/p><p>I will conclude on what should be done.  At the very least, the requests from Transparency International should be acted on.  These include extending the standard cooling-off period to two years.  The argument being made against this, which is that we have to pay a lot of attention to the rights of former politicians to get a job in lobbying, is a bit ludicrous.  Nobody else in the world has the right to a job in lobbying.  The only reason these people are getting access to those jobs is that they are former politicians.<\/p> <p>They would not get it otherwise.  There is the idea that these people have some innate right and we need to give significant weight to that.  There are plenty of other jobs in the world.  Most people do not get access to these lobbying jobs and would not have a chance.  We should make it clear there is at least a two-year cooling-off period during which people cannot walk out of politics and into a lobbying job, for obvious reasons.  Clearly the interest of society as a whole in not having this inappropriate influence takes significant precedence over the individual right of former Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la or Ministers to get jobs in lobbying firms.<\/p> <p> Second is the categorisation of breaches of cooling-off periods and other post-term employment regulations as offences.  It is bizarre to say these are not offences.  There is the outright ban on all Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities from acting as lobbyists or receiving income for the purpose of influencing public policy.  Other points I thought were strong include the fact that there should be a requirement to disclose not just the source but also the amount of funding received or fees charged by lobbyists to the lobbying regulator, as well as details of gifts, hospitality or travel provided to the targets of lobbying.<\/p> <p> I echo the point Deputy Shortall made on access.  It is ridiculous enough that former Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la get access to the car park.  Car parking for life should be gone.  We do not need this massive car park in the middle of town, encouraging people to drive into town forever.  People should lose access.  If, let us say, there is a cooling-off period of two years and afterwards people become lobbyists, they should then be lobbyists like everybody else.  They should not have special privileges relating to the fact they were previously elected.  They give that up for the period when they are lobbyists so people are not able to waltz in here and get easy access.  We cannot take their phone books away, stop them calling people or stop them having the social relations they have, but at least it sends a signal that such access is inappropriate and that we are opposed to the revolving door continuing to revolve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000039#PP00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666274700,"counter":403,"content":"<p>Before coming to the Bill, it has to be said that all people want in life is that things are proper and above board and that people behave in a way that is right and lawful.  There is a place in the world for lobbying.  Of course there is.  There is a place for lobbyists.<\/p>  <p>  Different organisations are named here on the record of the D&aacute;il.  I will take as an example the CIF.  I will say the polar opposite of what Deputies have just been listening to.  The reason is that I believe in work and in people working.  When I hear a person elected to the D&aacute;il talking about the political elite, it strikes me that perhaps the person talking is a member of the political elite.  Is he not elected, rightfully and gainfully?  He came here with a democratic right to be here.  Is he not a member of the political elite?  Here he is condemning the political elite and talking about the other elite in society.  Who are we talking about?  We are talking about people that got educated, worked hard and studied.  Whether they became a judge, barrister, solicitor, lawyer or county manager, are they the elite of Irish society?  To me they are ordinary people who got up off their backsides.  Their parents might have worked hard.  They worked hard and studied hard.  They were not dragging themselves around the place.  They drove themselves on, worked, got jobs and progressed in Irish life, and more luck to them.  Is there anything wrong in the world with that?<\/p>  <p>  I want to come back to the CIF for fear that people in Ireland would think everyone in the D&aacute;il is the same and that we pick on organisations that do good work.  Some people come in here and seem to want to pick on groups like that but to me a group like that comprises respectable people representing a respectable industry, namely, the construction industry.  There are developers in Ireland who are highly respectable and highly regarded people.  There are people building houses and making homes for people with 50 years.  I know of people who started with nothing, went to work on a building site on a bicycle and are now building houses with 50 years.  People who are in their 70s, and thankfully they are still building homes.<\/p>  <p>  One of them recently said this to me, and it hurt me badly when he said it because of how right he was.  \"Michael\", he said, \"isn't it awful?  Long ago when I was building a scheme of houses, the one group of people that you were guaranteed would be able to get a mortgage and buy one of my homes were the Garda and the nurse and the person like that.\"  He is always building affordable houses.  He was not a fly-by-night who came along and went.  He stood the test of time.  He still employs people.  I remind Deputies there is nothing wrong with employing people.  There is nothing wrong with people who get up at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. and create work.  It is not all about being in here talking about how we should all be on a four-day week and go home, lie down and watch \"Coronation Street\" type of a thing.  This man, who has been building houses with 50 years, said it was awful that, despite his best efforts, the Garda and nurse who want to buy a house find it is priced outside of their range.  It is awful to think we are in that situation.<\/p>  <p>  There is continuous talk in here about the developers, the elite and the this and that.  For God's sake, what do we want?  Is it to have nothing, no developers and nobody creating work?  Who will build the houses?  One of the most important things we had in Ireland in the past was the small builder.  Every parish had a small builder who might build one or two houses per year and create a bit of local employment.  Between themselves and subcontractors, they might have one or two permanent members of staff.  If we take what some people are saying in here, it is as though there was something wrong with those people as well.  Maybe some Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la would rather if everybody was drawing the dole or jobseeker's payments.  Is that what people want?<\/p>  <p>  There is talk of the awfulness of maximising profits.  What about the shops and different businesses that are trying to keep their doors open?  They are trying to keep the jobs they have created going and then they turn on the television or radio and hear Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la talking about maximising profits.  These people are running a business.  They are paying rates and insurance and trying to pay the electricity bill.  They are trying to ensure their workers get holiday pay, to keep the doors open and to provide a service.  What do they get for it?  There are people standing up here talking about these awful people trying to make a profit.  If they listened to some of the tripe that comes out of some people's mouths in here, they would ask what those people are doing in here.  These people who are talking are the political elite they are talking about.  I am sorry for going on about somebody who is raving but I have to answer it back because when you hear rubbish in the D&aacute;il, sometimes you have to call it out for what it is.  When it looks like rubbish, it is rubbish.<\/p>  <p>  Lobbying is generally defined as any direct or indirect communication with public officials, decision makers or representatives for the purpose of influencing public decision-making and carried out on behalf of any organised group.  This to me is an important job of work because sometimes we need people to talk up for smaller groups.  That is why, for instance, across in Buswells Hotel and over in the audiovisual room today we had people - do Deputies want to call them lobbyists? - from the stuttering awareness group of Ireland.  I listened intently to them for the last hour concerning how they have done so well in life and telling personal stories about themselves.  They are here lobbying and want us to be aware of their plight.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Would we have some people on the left thinking that is some type of undue influence on us?  This is what we are here for - to listen to people who are making their case.<\/p> <p>They might be making their case on behalf of the farmers, the pharmacists, the doctors or the nurses.  They might be making their case on behalf of a wide variety of different groups, such as the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  Our job is to listen to those people.  This Bill comes at a time when public trust in government is at an all-time low.  The practice of lobbying is widely associated with secrecy and unfair advantage.  Why do people think that?  They think it because they hear things like the speech we heard earlier highlighting it, trying to pour petrol on it and making it out to be something it is not.  In the years I have been here, the lobbying I have seen has been what I would call highly respectable, sound and well thought-out.  It has involved people coming here and making their points and their voices heard.  <\/p> <p> There have been cases where there must be a cooling-off period.  If a person was a Minister or a politician, then of course there should be a cooling-off period.  Unlike other speakers, I would turn it around.  If a person has experience in a Department, maybe they would be a very good person to speak up for an organisation because they would know how to do it.  I will mention as an example the way lobbying goes on in America.  I would not be a fan of much of what happens there because it seems that big bucks are involved, but lobbying can be the only way that people can be heard and noticed by government there.  Things have gone wrong in the past because people used their advantage unfairly but the majority of people are not like that.  Retired politicians, county managers or senior engineers who worked with local authorities might have a great insight into what an organisation needs and might understand how they can best put forward their case.  There is nothing wrong with that.<\/p> <p> Lobbying is an integral part of a healthy democracy and is closely related to universal values such as freedom of speech and the right to petition government.  It allows for various interest groups to present their views on public decisions that may come to affect them.  It has the potential to enhance the quality of decision-making by providing channels for the input of expertise on increasingly technical issues to legislators and decision-makers.  However, lobbying must be ethical and transparent.  At its core, its objective must be to help policy development.  That is very important.  Over recent years, we have witnessed multiple scandals in Ireland and throughout Europe demonstrating that without clear and enforceable rules a select number of voices with better resources and contacts can come to dominate political decision-making.  At the very least, this can skew individual decisions; and at worst, it can lead to a wide-scale institutional and state capture.<\/p> <p> Unfair and opaque lobbying practices constitute one of the key corruption risks facing Ireland and Europe, according to Transparency International.  Six out of ten European citizens consider their government to be seriously influenced or entirely co-opted by a few vested interests.  Any serious effort to combat undue influence in politics must recognise that transparency measures must be accompanied by a broader measure to strengthen public integrity and to promote opportunities for access by a wide range of citizens to the political system.  The overall results of various research on Irish legislation and protections around lobbying have given serious cause for concern and suggest that attempts to date to promote open and ethical lobbying standards by governments, political parties and lobbyists have been piecemeal and ineffective.  In Ireland, much of the influence of lobbyists remains hidden and informal.  That is why we have to ensure we do not allow the type of behaviour we saw in the banking sector to happen again.  There was the whole scandal with the mortgages in the banks and what happened with Bank of Ireland and the way they mistreated their customers.  We must ensure that type of situation is not allowed to happen again.<\/p> <p> The measures in the new Bill have been accused of being technical rather than substantive by some commentators.  The general feeling in the public seems to be that much further action is needed to restore public confidence in policy-making.  That brings me back to the speeches that have been made here.  If you listened to the speech that was made before mine, you would ask how in the name of God we could have any confidence whatsoever in policy-making.  Again, we are not all full of negativity like others.  The Bill provides for a cooling-off period of at least a year, and maybe longer, during which former Ministers, special advisers and senior officials will not be allowed to become lobbyists.<\/p> <p> I welcome anything that will ensure two things: first, that wrong-doing will not happen; and second, that the lobbying I am used to, which involves people coming before us in the audiovisual room or in Buswells Hotel, will continue.  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, for example, comes up here once a year in advance of the budget to make its case, and rightfully so.  Would some people like that to stop?  Would some people like if such organisations could not highlight inadequacies in Government policy, thereby facilitating us to come in here and fight on their behalf?  That would undermine democracy.  We must be very careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  We want to make sure we will be voices for the people in an honest and straight way.  When I do a clinic in Kerry on a Monday night, a young person or someone who is middle-aged or old might tell me that something is wrong.  Then, on Tuesday, I can stand up here and bring a Minister, the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste to task by mentioning what was highlighted to me the previous night.  Is that not democracy and what it is all about?  If a sick child whose illness is not recognised by the HSE for funding is in trouble, is it not a great thing to be able to come before the D&aacute;il to highlight that?  That to me is real politics and real work.  That is what it is all about.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for listening.  I will finish the way I started.  Sometimes when you listen to what is said in this Chamber, it would make you think.  That is all I can say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000040#QQ00200","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666275300,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be able to comment on this Bill.  I do not know if I have ever addressed the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, in this format discussing legislation.  I wish him well as an Aire Rialtais and thank him for his co-operation and courtesy.  Any time I contact him, or whenever anyone in my group does so, we get a reasonable response.  That is very much appreciated by us and by all Members of the House.  I wish him, agus a clann go l&eacute;ir, well.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is very important.  I have been very critical.  I have been in the Chair for the last while.  I listened to the last two contributions and there was a diverse range of views.  That is very important and that is why we are here.  We are duly elected, thankfully, for the time being, to make our feelings known, but we need some reform.  Like my colleague, I am a man who likes to get up in the morning and do a day's work.  If it goes into the evening or the night, so be it.  You get up the morning after, field out again and work hard.  I must declare that I am self-employed, like the previous Deputy.  Those types of people are very important to our country, especially now above all times when such huge pressures are coming on.  <\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, I welcomed representatives of the stuttering association of Ireland here this morning.  <\/p> <p>It is a wonderful group that came to meet us today.  So many groups make presentations in the audiovisual room.  Yesterday, for instance, we met groups talking about maternity care, breastfeeding and forestry.  A vast range of people come in to meet us.  I do not call them lobbyists.  They are just trying to improve people's lives hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly.  They are great people.  Many of them are volunteers.<\/p> <p> A member of the group we met today is a former town councillor from Templemore, Mr. Michael Ryan.  The group's members are all volunteers and do not get a shilling from anyone.  The work they have done in their year and a half must be noted.  The group has gone Europe-wide, and it is going international on Saturday at 2 p.m. on Zoom.  This is because stuttering is an impediment and has not been understood.  I have a far better understanding of it from listening to the gentleman today in the audiovisual room.  One member of the group was a teacher from the Minister's county who has been teaching for 25 or 30 years.  It is a question of the quiet boy in the class.  We now have so many special needs assistants because daoine &oacute;ga are now diagnosed with different learning impediments.  It is important that the representatives come here to meet us and that they have a forum for doing so.  I thank the ushers, the secretariat and the other staff here for always facilitating them.<\/p> <p> The groups that come here are diverse.  Before this year's budget, they were all cut off the hook.  It is natural for groups, whether they represent the motor industry, pharmacists or GPs, to approach us.  As there are so many of them, we were running around nearly meeting them all together when the budget came early.  I include the IFA and many others.  Their job is to represent their members.  We should remember that the salaries of their paid employees, if there are such employees, are paid for by their members, who pay their taxes, VAT and everything else.  They provide valuable employment up and down the country, especially in rural areas.  Therefore, we must not brand them all as vagabonds and people who try to twist people's arms.  It is a democratic process that they are involved in, and they have a democratic right to meet elected members of all parties and none and explain their difficulties and issues, including with the tax code and the current restrictions.  They have had a very tough time with Brexit and now with imports, exports and everything else.<\/p> <p> Those of us with clinics meet people every day of the week.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae holds clinics in Kerry that go on until nearly midnight.  It suits certain people to visit at certain times.  That must never be taken away.<\/p> <p> I would not like this Bill to have unintended consequences.  I have been very strong recently on the unintended consequences of legislation.  We have been passing Bills, especially in the past two years but also before that, that have a very punitive impact on the self-employed, on job creators and on those who run businesses, be they one-man or one-woman shows, enterprises with five, ten, 15 or 20 staff, the likes of Liebherr outside Killarney or the many industries in my area.<\/p> <p> The Minister will know that due to the savage increases in the costs of electricity and gas, supermarkets, butchers' shops, hairdressers and others are lobbying us.  I refer to every business that uses electricity.  They just cannot cope with the prices.  The Government has brought in the new temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which will help but will not cover all the costs.  Unfortunately, many businesses will fall through the cracks.  Have they no right, according to Teachta&iacute; eile, to meet us to make their case and lobby?  They have, of course.  Therefore, we must make sure this legislation is robust.<\/p> <p> Transparency International is obviously not happy with the proposed legislation, saying it is mainly technical.  I missed the debate on the previous Bill we discussed because it ran so fast and I was at meetings.  When I came into the House, I had intended to speak on it.  I am very disappointed I did not get to do so.  Will the Chair allow me-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000041#RR00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1666275900,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I will give some latitude; it is Thursday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000042#SS00200","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1666275900,"counter":408,"content":"<p>It is Thursday. Go raibh maith agat.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen some quite successful court cases recently related to gang terrorism and everything else, and we have seen the latest developments concerning the witness protection programme associated with Dublin's gangland.  Is there any chance that the Minister will pass on the idea of exploring similar arrangements regarding the murder in 1996 of Sophie Toscan du Plantier?  The matter has been going on for so long that it is embarrassing to our country.  It is important that it be explored.  I wanted to say that today because it is important.  I thank the Chair for his latitude.<\/p>  <p>  We will deal with this Bill through amendments if a majority in my group agrees.  We have different opinions about the revolving door.  Before I ever became a Member of this House, I saw senior public officials who retired very young getting good jobs somewhere else two days later.  They have the inside track.  The Minister proposes a cooling-off period of one year but I believe it should be three to five years.  One year is too short and gives an unfair edge in respect of information.  That is why the individuals are headhunted.<\/p>  <p>  A big business, unlike an ordinary, small business, a gn&oacute; beag, will have the resources to take on individuals &ndash; we call them lobbyists but they are not lobbyists as such &ndash; who know their way around.  We have to be very careful when we talk about former Members not being allowed access to the car park.  Some of us cannot cycle from Tipperary to Dublin.  There is no train within 30 miles of me.  I often got a spin from the Minister and others, which I appreciate because I have difficulty at the moment with mo sh&uacute;ile.  I was delighted to bump into former Senator Donie Cassidy here two weeks ago and to have some good banter with him.  He gave long service here, as did many others.  I just mention Mr. Cassidy because he is the former Member I met most recently.  If some current Members had their way, they would lock the gates against such people and tell them to keep out, go home or go away and hide.  We must respect the people who went before us.  Respect and compassion are very important across society, especially in this day and age.  Mr. Cassidy gave sterling service not only to his party but also to his people and the House.  He was a great man and very entertaining.  He and his family have provided much employment, and they still do.  I was delighted to meet him and to learn something from him.  It is great to meet a former or retired colleague &ndash; I nearly said a fallen hero &ndash; who comes in to meet us.  It is very important and there should be no hang-ups about it.  Mr. Cassidy drove here in the car.  He drives a good car.  He always has a bit of style and panache.  He is welcome.  Cuirim f&iacute;or-f&aacute;ilte roimh daoine mar sin i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  This is difficult legislation but it is somewhat feeble.  Transparency International and such groups are not happy with it.  That is the aspect I would be worried about.  The Minister will have heard me refer in other contributions to big conglomerates.  They do not need lobbyists because they are so powerful.  We cannot rein them in.  We see this now with the price gouging in the electricity and gas markets.  We in the Rural Independent Group are adamant and we are striving very hard to have us use our natural resources.  We have met people who want to get Barryroe oil in.  The individuals cannot be called lobbyists because they are investors in our country.  They want to see what resources we have.  They know that there is a certain amount and that there could be a lot more.  They would bring the oil ashore and it would not cost the Irish taxpayer aon phingin amh&aacute;in, not a single penny, or, in today's money, not a single cent.  Despite, this, they are branded as aliens.  Parts of my county were out of power last night, admittedly due to the storm.  When people face power outages, they invest in generators.  They are worried about keeping their businesses going.  The same applies to gas.<\/p>  <p>  When I, as an elected representative, have asked the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to clarify whether he intends, as per a memo on his desk, to put ready-mixed concrete into the gas line off Kinsale, which, although folamh or empty, has served the country well, he has refused to answer.  I have asked his Minister of State also.  This should not be allowed to happen because we have people who could bring gas to Ireland and store it in floating terminals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102000042#SS00300","speaker":"1612"}]
