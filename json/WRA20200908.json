The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of the most economically vulnerable children and those living with other forms of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.  It specifically targets families with varying degrees of economic disadvantage using information drawn from Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to calculate the amount of subsidy paid. Children of families with the least income get the highest subsidy. <\/p><p>The NCS is a significant step forward in combating the poverty traps inherent in previous childcare schemes. It removes many of the very restrictive eligibility requirements, which were previously linked to Social Protection payments for example.<\/p><p>Analysis of previous schemes informed its design and helps it incentivise work and training to combat poverty and inter-generational poverty and improve outcomes for children.<\/p><p>There is an important sponsorship arrangement within the NCS which offers additional supports for families with complex and challenging needs that early learning and childcare can help to address.<\/p><p>Where there is a referral from one of several sponsor bodies, the family will automatically qualify for a subsidy for the number of hours considered appropriate by the sponsor, up to 45 hours per week, without having to satisfy the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility requirements. <\/p><p>In the coming months I hope to see the numbers of children availing of sponsorship increase as awareness rises.<\/p><p>I am working with my officials to identify whether any refinements to the NCS are needed to ensure that it delivers for those most in need. <\/p><p>In addition, work is progressing on a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector which I hope will enable delivery of additional funding to providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, accessibility, quality and inclusion in their services.<\/p><p>It is my hope that the new funding model will introduce a model that will provide specific and additional support to children living with disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800056#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 30 and 31 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800056#WRB00700"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[22320\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800056#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of social workers hired by Tusla in 2020; and the number of those who were hired who are over and above the number who were replaced by social workers who retired or left their posts.","asker":"1514","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>As of 31st July 2020, 187 new Social Workers have been recruited in 2020 by Tusla.

Despite this progress, investment in the area remains low by international standards. <\/p><p>In their latest calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on early learning and care, the OECD includes an estimate of the cost of primary school for children aged under 6 years. <\/p><p>This is to account for the fact that many children in Ireland start primary school at an earlier age than in other countries. Using this measure, Ireland spends an estimated 0.5% of GDP on childcare. <\/p><p>If the cost of primary school for children aged under 6 is excluded, Ireland spends just 0.2% of GDP on this area, compared to the OECD average of 0.7%. Our spending also falls short of the UNICEF-recommended investment level of 1.0% of GDP. <\/p><p>It is important to note however that Irish GDP is seen as a poor point of international comparison and work is underway to provide more analysis using an alternative benchmark. That being said everyone acknowledges we need greater investment. <\/p><p>The First 5 Strategy, commits the Government to at least double public spending on early learning and care services by 2028. This doubling of investment would increase Ireland&rsquo;s position by &euro;574m or by approximately an extra 0.2  per cent of GDP.  Every 0.1% increase in spending as a share of GDP would cost an estimated &euro;339m per annum.  <\/p><p>A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers optimally for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model. <\/p><p>An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model was appointed in September 2019.

This scheme supports youth work activities at a local level by providing small grants to youth clubs and groups. <\/p>  <p>  I was also delighted to recently announce capital funding of over &euro;2.3 million to 147 youth projects and services and 25 national youth organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy of my commitment to children, young people and their families, my commitment to the youth sector that provides such crucial support to them and my commitment to continue to invest in youth services as stated in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800057#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800057#WRC05000"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[22324\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800057#WRC05100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the supports in place for childcare providers to continue to operate after-school care during the Covid-19 public health emergency.","asker":"1449","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>On 10 June 2020, my Department announced a &euro;75m package of funding to facilitate the reopening of early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services.

The IBRC Commission, which is an independent statutory commission, contracted services to manage their public relations responsibilities. <\/p><p>The spend to date in 2020 has been focussed on the COVID-19 emergency. <\/p><p>Since March, my Department has co-ordinated communications for the whole-of-government response to the pandemic. This necessitated expenditure on a broad range of targeted public information campaigns.<\/p><p>At the beginning of April, a campaign was run in conjunction with the COVID-19 Community Call Forum, which was established so that local groups worked with State agencies and community and voluntary groups to provide important supports and services to any vulnerable person who needed them.<\/p><p>A number of campaigns were run as restrictions were imposed in order to explain the measures and reinforce public health messages.<\/p><p>On 1stMay last, the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap to Reopen Society and Business was published.

The campaigns associated with the Roadmap were aimed at giving people time to prepare, so that businesses could be ready to open, for example churches and places of worship, gyms, cinemas, and leisure facilities.<\/p><p>Over the summer, there has been a specific campaign to help students, and all those involved in the Education sector, manage the 2020 Leaving Certificate and the new standardisation of grades model.

This required a significant cross Government information campaign.<\/p><p>At different junctures of the response to the pandemic, the Government announced its response to handling the different Phases of actions including the lifting and re-imposition of restrictions.

This package is a key part of the second phase, the recovery phase, of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic and in total the range of measures announced related to a total stimulus of &euro;7.4 bn, including tax, expenditure and credit supports.<\/p><p>The assistance already rolled out and the additional measures announced in the July Jobs Stimulus package have significant fiscal implications. In this regard, Government has targeted a headline deficit of &euro;30 billion for 2020 which would be in line with the average of fiscal positions across the EU in tackling the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p><p>The suite of supports that my Department has developed in response to the COVID-19 crisis aims to achieve the widest reach with Exchequer money to support viable business across all sectors and across the variety of needs.<\/p><p>Within the July Jobs Stimulus package, I have prioritised grants to businesses by providing &euro;300 million to the Restart Grant scheme from the &euro;450 million of expenditure allocated to my Department. I have also increased the maximum funding allowed to individual businesses under the scheme to &euro;25,000. <\/p><p>The July package also includes &euro;2 bn in credit supports to be made available to eligible businesses through a scheme which is underpinned by an 80% State guarantee. An important attribute of loan schemes is the multiplier effect of Exchequer funding: up to &euro;2bn in credit will be available now to support eligible businesses, while the cost to the State will be limited to 80% of the value of loan defaults. Furthermore, Exchequer costs for the scheme will be spread over a six-year window and will thus be incurred at a time when it is envisioned that State finances will be in a stronger position. <\/p><p>It should be noted that not all businesses need the same level or type of support, and that is why the package is comprised of a range of measures including grants and loans.<\/p><p>It is not the case that debt is being prioritised over grants in the July Jobs Stimulus package. As I have outlined above, two thirds of direct expenditure from my Department was assigned to direct grant support to businesses through the Restart Grant scheme, and this in addition to the expenditure underpinning support for business through the new Wage Employment Support Scheme which will provide for an estimated stimulus of &euro;1.9 bn. <\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that the value of supports made available across the different measures may differ significantly from the amount of Exchequer expenditure required to provide these supports. For example, the Government is able to leverage Exchequer funding into a significantly larger package for business, including the &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme which relates to a substantial portion of the overall stimulus package announced but for which the associated cost to the Exchequer will be significantly lower than the lending made available through the scheme.<\/p><p>With regard to the EU post-pandemic recovery package, this is an EU wide budgetary package made up of grants and loans to Member States. The consideration of grants and loans in the context of member states is not directly comparable to the discussion of the provision of grants and loans to businesses as set out in the July Jobs Stimulus package, which is a domestic jobs stimulus programme. As such, I see no contradiction as to the Government&rsquo;s position on this topic at the European Union summit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800058#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[22054\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800058#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding loans for small businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>There are a number of State-supported loan schemes in place to support small businesses.<\/p><p>If the business has been impacted by COVID-19, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes lending available to eligible businesses to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment.

However, my Department maintains an overview of key sectors of the economy to understand sectorial challenges and to facilitate a cohesive strategic approach to economic development.<\/p>  <p>In this context, my Department has developed a series of sectorial reports, Irish Economic Sectorial Reports 2020,   which I brought to Cabinet for information in early August.  These reports provide an overview of 16 key sectors and identify initial impacts of the pandemic on sectors as well as ongoing challenges and, in some cases, opportunities facing sectors.  Published versions of the 16 sectorial reports, Focus on Sectors 2020, were launched by my colleagues Minister Harris and Minister English on 22 August.<\/p>  <p>  While many of the sectors covered in these reports fall within the remit of my Department and its agencies, broader sectorial development responsibility spans a range of other Government Departments and the sectorial reports are developed in conjunction with those Departments. They also reflect inputs from industry representative organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  Of the sectors covered in the reports, Aerospace &amp;amp; Aviation and Tourism &amp;amp; Hospitality are amongst the most heavily affected sectors, severely impacted by the almost complete shutdown of international air travel and the social distancing measures required to contain the virus.  Recovery in these sectors is uncertain and dependent on the evolution of the virus and ongoing travel restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  As an island economy built largely on international trade and foreign direct investment, the recovery of the aviation sector is crucial for wider economy recovery.  The latest CSO figures from June 2020 show arrivals and departures decreased by 97. 8% and 97.3% respectively by comparison to June 2019.  According to a recent forecast across the airline sector IATA do not anticipate global capacity returning to 2019 levels before the 2023\/24-time frame. Enterprises across the aviation value chain, with the sole exception of dedicated cargo operators, have seen severe depletion of business and organisations are facing various degrees of financial challenge.<\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce for Aviation Recovery, established on 10 June 2020 by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has set out a series of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, some of which have already been implemented in the recently announced July Stimulus.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand the fundamental role that the car rental industry plays in supporting overseas tourism and providing the opportunity for high spending tourists to visit all parts of the country, particularly the less accessible rural areas.  This accessibility is crucial to local economies and jobs.  I recognise that the public health requirements have had a very severe impact on international tourism and consequently, the car rental market.  Officials in my Department have examined recent submissions from the car rental sector.  Supports announced in the July Stimulus will have a wide reach across the economy, and address many of the needs of the sector outlined in the correspondence.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the stimulus package gives certainty and employment supports to business, including through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme which will run to April 2021; gives a clear timeline for the continuation of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which will help to provide assurances to those who suffered job losses as a result of COVID-19; enhances the Restart Grant to assist even more businesses as they resume activity; and increases the attractiveness of liquidity supports such as the Credit Guarantee Scheme and Micro Finance Ireland Loans.

The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential. Through the Plans, the aim is to ensure that quality jobs are created in all regions that are sustainable in the longer term, to secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic success. <\/p>  <p>  The Plans are also maintained as &lsquo;live&rsquo; agendas which aim to be agile and responsive to both new opportunities and new challenges, for example: Brexit, Climate Action, Digital Economy, and most recently, the Covid-19 pandemic economic impacts.<\/p>  <p>  The West Regional Enterprise Plan has 6 Strategic Objectives which focus on building greater capability within the life science sector; ensuring sustainable growth in the tourism sector; building on the West&rsquo;s unique creative assets; enhancing the growth of Ag Tech in the West; aligning training to current and future skills needs; and enhancing the quality and availability of enterprise space in the West. <\/p>  <p>The West Regional Steering Committee met on 31 July last and considered the range of COVID-19 and wider economic challenges for the West region and indeed issues arising in relation to vulnerable jobs and sectors.

An additional tranche of &euro;40m was provided in 2019.<\/p>  <p>   The REDF is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. The competitive Fund supports significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectorial strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation. <\/p>  <p>  This is achieved by co-financing the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level. The Fund helps to ensure the benefits of our growing economy are felt in all regions.    <\/p>  <p>  To date, the REDF has been delivered through three calls with 68 projects across all regions securing a total of almost &euro;100 million in funding.<\/p>  <p>  The West Region secured funding of over &euro;16.7 million across nine projects. <\/p>  <p>  This funding complements other funding such as funding provided under Project Ireland 2040 with funding provided under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund and the Climate Action Fund. <\/p>  <p>Finally, as regards job creation there are 32,900 more people in employment in the West from Q1 2015, when the first Regional Action Plan for Jobs commenced to Q2 2020.

The &ldquo;dispatch down&rdquo; is split into two categories, constraints and curtailment. Constraints relate to insufficient grid network and curtailment to a surplus of non-synchronous technologies, such as wind, on the system.The 11% is currently evenly split between curtailment and constraints.   The issue of whether the windfarm gets paid when dispatched down is currently as follows: curtailment is not paid and constraints are only compensated in limited circumstances where the generator has a guarantee of delivery from the network operators, EirGrid or ESB Networks.<\/p>  <p>  To mitigate the issue of constraints there is now an obligation on the network owners to enhance the grid network so that constraints are minimised.<\/p>  <p>Amongst other benefits, interconnection provides an outlet for the export of surplus levels of renewable energy such as wind, thereby reducing curtailment levels. The Climate Action Plan states the importance of developing further interconnection to facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s 2030 target of 70% renewable electricity. More recently, the Programme for Government further emphasises its importance and commits to &ldquo;commence planning for future interconnection with our neighbours&rdquo; and to &ldquo;strengthen the policy framework to incentivise electricity storage and interconnection  &ldquo;<\/p>  <p>  The costs of interconnection are included in the costs of electricity networks as part of a regulated asset base.

Regarding the application of the\u00a0LSZ approach on a nationwide basis, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would legally challenge such a move. The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide approach cannot be adopted without applying it also to\u00a0the burning of peat, turf and wet wood, because they assert that these products produce similar levels of pollution to coal. The legal threat is not only to frustrate\u00a0any new nationwide ban, but to remove the existing ban. <\/p>  <p>  In that context, we have given a commitment in the Programme for Government to work towards a full nationwide extension of the regulations over the lifetime of the Government. \u00a0The Department is taking the first step in this process by developing a public consultation document which recognises the need for a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of solid fuel\u00a0 generally, with a view to ensuring a transition to lower polluting fuels for residential heating. Responses received to the consultation will help to inform the decisions made regarding the implementation and enforcement of a nationwide extension.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended to commence this public consultation process this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800062#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Infrastructure","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800062#WRH02700"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[22164\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800062#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if broadband will be provided to areas (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is a policy initiative that covers commercial deployments and also a State led intervention in areas where it was not viable for commercial operators to deploy high speed broadband networks.<\/p><p>The premises\u00a0referred to in the Question\u00a0are located in the BLUE\u00a0area on the NBP High Speed Broadband Map which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.\u00a0\u00a0These BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area\u00a0covered by the National Broadband Plan as\u00a0commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so.

The Smart Meter\u00a0Upgrade is a meter replacement programme to modern, smart-ready technology. New generation electricity meters are being rolled out across Europe and internationally and when the programme completes in Ireland in 2024 all domestic and business premises will have a new modern meter installed. <\/p>  <p>  The upgrade will encourage energy efficiency, support an increase in renewable power on the energy system, facilitate microgeneration and result in lower overall costs for consumers.

In the delivery of smart meters, ESB Networks is required to ensure that the meters would, at a minimum, meet Irish and EU product health and safety legislation and standards which require manufacturers to ensure that any product placed on the market is safe. In particular, smart meters in Ireland must comply with the ICNIRP Guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic fields.

As COVID-19 is a national crisis, it merits a national response.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus Package, co-ordinated by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, built on the extensive enterprise and employment supports already deployed by Government in response to COVID-19 with the aim of helping to get Ireland&rsquo;s businesses, including SPSV businesses, back on their feet.  Officials from the Department of Transport and the NTA, the statutory taxi regulator, have been working together alongside officials in other Government Departments to ensure that SPSV operators, many of whom are self-employed, can avail of the range of COVID-19 financial support measures to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  SPSV operators, many of whom are self-employed, can presently avail of a range of the available measures, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), which is available until April 2021, and the Enterprise Support Grant for businesses impacted by COVID-19, which was launched by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 14 August 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  The Enterprise Support Grant is available to assist eligible self-employed recipients who come off the PUP on or after 18 May 2020 and who are not liable for commercial rates. The grant provides business owners with a once-off grant of up to &euro;1,000 to restart their business which was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding is awarded for eligible costs up to the maximum of &euro;1,000, and is awarded on costs relating to opening the relevant business, such as safety measures, repairs, fuel, wages and business advice or mentoring.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, self-employed individuals who were profitable in 2019 but not in 2020 due to COVID-19 may be able to avail of an income tax relief off-set up to &euro;25,000 of 2020 losses against 2019 profits.<\/p>  <p>  SPSV businesses, such as licensed taxi dispatch operators, can also avail of measures such as the COVID-19 Restart Grant, the COVID-19 Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Business Loan Scheme, which involves loans of up to &euro;25,000 interest-free for six-months, with a Government rebate of interest paid in the following six months.<\/p>  <p>  For its part, the National Transport Authority (NTA), the statutory regulator, took a series of actions to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change. These actions included licence extensions, the waiver of late licence renewal fees, and, in conjunction with the motor insurance industry, the suspension of SPSV insurance for those operators who decided to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Since the onset of the pandemic, the NTA has communicated regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on the SPSV industry. It has also published information on its website for the SPSV industry, including guidance on the installation of screens and guidelines on how to keep vehicles clean to reduce the spread of COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  The focus of the efforts of the Department of Transport and the NTA has been on assisting those who have stopped working to get back to work as the economy reopens and passenger demand for SPSVs returns. In this regard, this Department is in regular contact with the NTA to monitor the impact that the reopening of the economy in line with the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business is having on demand for SPSV services and to ensure that SPSV operators who have temporarily stopped working are well placed to return to work.  Officials from this Department and the NTA are also continuing to engage with the Advisory Committee of Small Public Service Vehicles in relation to the proposals in the report made by that Committee on assisting the SPSV sector to recover from the impact of the pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800065#WRL00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin Bus","counter":449,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800065#WRL00600"},{"type":"question","counter":450,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[21575\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800065#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the measures being implemented to ensure that there will be capacity for school students on Dublin Bus particularly during peak times while adhering to social distancing when schools resume to ensure they get to school on time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1574","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. <\/p>  <p>  The School Transport Scheme comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills.

I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times. A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network. <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, my Department has been working closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to ensure public transport services continue and to plan for the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. In this context, the NTA is engaging directly with both PSO and commercial transport operators.  <\/p>  <p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business   on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity.  Alongside this change, it was also decided that the wearing of a face covering when using public transport would be made mandatory.  The Regulations for the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport were introduced under Health legislation on 10 July and came into effect on Monday 13 July. Public health advice tells us that face coverings are an important safety measure, especially in interior spaces, but that they are not suitable for every individual, particularly those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to young age. <\/p>  <p>  Further, there is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and therefore should only be used for essential travel, with only those who absolutely have to travel at peak times doing so and encouraging staggered retail and office opening hours. People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.<\/p>  <p>  As part of new restrictions announced by Government on the 18th August, people have been asked to avoid public transport where possible. This advice along with other measures (such as continuing to work from home where possible) is aimed at suppressing the spread of Covid-19 in Ireland. The advice is also aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, most notably, front-line workers.<\/p>  <p>  The new measures were introduced following recommendations made to Government by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800065#WRL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":480,"content":"<p>Question No. 214 answered with Question No. 183.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800065#WRL03800"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[21794\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800065#WRL03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the recommendations made by the task force for aviation recovery in its final report which will be implemented; the timeline for each recommendation to be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s long term economic wellbeing is closely linked to our global connectivity.

Many of these commercial operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery.<\/p>  <p>  For that reason, on 25 June the Government approved temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, for the licensed bus sector. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months.

Where the accommodation is provided as part of a trade carried on by the taxpayer, the income is taxable under Case I of Schedule D of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.However, where the provision of guest accommodation is occasional in nature, the income arising should be treated as miscellaneous income (taxable under Case IV of Schedule D). Under self-assessment rules, a person is obliged to submit an annual tax return showing his\/her taxable income from all sources (including rental income) and pay the tax due on that taxable income.  <\/p><p>PAYE taxpayers who have also received profit income from the provision of rooms through online accommodation sites also come under the self-assessment system and, therefore, have an obligation to make an annual tax return showing all sources of income and to pay the tax due on that income. However, in certain circumstances, PAYE taxpayers (excluding certain company directors) whose combined taxable profit from their non-PAYE income is less than &euro;5,000 (or where the gross income is less than &euro;30,000) per annum may elect to pay the tax due on such taxable profit through the PAYE system by reducing their personal tax credits.  Where the tax due on all such income has been collected through the PAYE system for a tax year there is no obligation to complete a tax return for that tax year unless specifically requested to do so by Revenue.<\/p><p>Where taxpayers have already filed their tax return but have not declared profit income from sources referred to by the Deputy, or similar sources, they may self-correct their tax return without incurring penalties, provided it is completed by 31 October 2020 and they have not been notified by Revenue of a compliance intervention.  It should be noted that interest on any outstanding tax amount will still be payable and will continue to accumulate until the outstanding amount is paid. For taxpayers who have not yet filed a tax return or have not declared relevant income, they should write to their local Revenue office, setting out details of any income received and related expenses for all relevant years.<\/p><p>Regarding rent-a-room relief, this is provided for in Section 216A of the TCA 1997. Under the legislation, sums arising to an individual in respect of the letting of a room or rooms as residential accommodation in his or her home and from meals or other services supplied in connection with the letting are exempt from income tax, USC and PRSI where these sums are below the annual limit for the tax year in question (&euro;12,000 for 2015 and 2016 and &euro;14,000 for 2017 and subsequent years) and certain other conditions are satisfied.<\/p><p>The purpose of the relief is to increase the supply of affordable rental residential accommodation by incentivising homeowners to rent out a room or rooms in their principal private residence to individuals. It applies where an individual is effectively using the room either on its own or in conjunction with other parts of the residence, as his or her home. The relief is not, and never was, intended to apply to income arising from the provision of guest accommodation to occasional visitors and Revenue has consistently clarified this point and I am aware that the clarification has also been subject to significant coverage.<\/p><p>Revenue has published comprehensive guidance across all taxes, including Income Tax and VAT, on the tax treatment of income from the provision of short-term accommodation, which the Deputy may find helpful.

The EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  <\/p><p>Under the legislation as enacted, proprietary directors are not qualifying employees for the purposes of the scheme.  The primary rationale behind the exclusion is that a proprietary director is a person who is the owner (or co-owner) of a company and so it is considered that such a position is much less likely to be a vulnerable employment when compared with regular workers, noting an objective of the EWSS is to maintain the relationship between employee and employer insofar as is possible.  <\/p><p>However, as I announced at the end of July, this position has been revisited and the EWSS can be claimed by an eligible employer in respect of proprietary directors.  Following the review of the matter undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners it has been agreed that the only additional qualifying criteria that will apply in the case of proprietary directors as qualifying employees is that the proprietary director has to have been paid wages which were reported to Revenue on the payroll of the eligible employer at any stage between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020.  Further, it has also been agreed that where a person is a proprietary director of two or more eligible companies, a claim for EWSS can only be submitted in respect of a single company only.  <\/p><p>The amending legislation necessary to give a statutory footing to the above will be included in the Finance Bill later this year.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the above will be implemented by Revenue as confirmed in both a press release that was issued on 31 Augustsee<\/p><p>and the updated Guidance <\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800067#WRN04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":605,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[21269\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800067#WRN04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to instances in which employers availing of the temporary wage subsidy scheme do not pass on the increase in the minimum wage to their employees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1618","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":606,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wages Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was legislated for in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.

There is no distinction made regarding the subsidy amount based on whether the business has closed due to the restrictions brought in by the Government or has continued to trade with employees continuing to part-time or work full time with similar hours as before the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the TWSS.  There is, however, no minimum amount that the employer must pay as an additional payment in order to be eligible for the scheme, but for Revenue operational systems reasons the employer will need to enter at least &euro;0.01 in Gross Pay when running its payroll.  <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that the question of an individual&rsquo;s entitlements in an employment context, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee in the light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business, are matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS.  Essentially, the scheme has no role in relation to the employer\/employee relationship in so far as the terms, conditions and entitlements of the employment are concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the National Minimum Wage which increased to &euro;10.10 per hour on 1 February 2020 as set out in the National Minimum Wage Order 2020.  Disputes in relation to payment of the National Minimum Wage may be referred to Workplace Relations Commission. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that details of subsidy payments made by pay date are available to view in each employee&rsquo;s myAccount record on Revenue&rsquo;s online system.  This facility allows employees to see whether their employer is participating in the scheme and being refunded a wage subsidy on their behalf.  Where the amount of subsidy paid is available from the relevant employer payroll submissions made to Revenue, that amount is also displayed.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800067#WRN04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800067#WRN04900"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[21307\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800067#WRN05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of extending the additional 5% increase of the help-to-buy scheme retrospectively to include all beneficiaries of the scheme that have drawn down the grant since March 2020; his views on such an extension to the stimulus; and if he will report on same.","asker":"1551","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the cost of extending the additional 5% increase of the Help to Buy scheme (and &euro;30,000 maximum cap), that was introduced in the July stimulus package on 23 July, to all claims approved between 1 March 2020 and 22 July 2020 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;13m.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the proposition that the scheme should be extended to include all HTB applicants since March last, the position is that the Government decided, and the Oireachtas endorsed in passing the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020, that the threshold date for eligibility for the enhanced level of support was 23 July 2020.

This change from the Temporary wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. <\/p>  <p>  The main subsidy level of &euro;203 per paid worker per week granted under the EWSS is commensurate with the average payment per worker under the TWSS which has been reducing since the start of June.  Since 14 August, the figure was &euro;283 across all recipients and &euro;219 in the case of first-time recipients. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the direct support, it is important to note that a 0.5% rate of employers PRSI will continue to apply for employments that are eligible for the subsidy.

It lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance. These commitments include increasing transparency; addressing legal reforms in certain areas of civil law; addressing fraud; enhancing and reforming the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and increasing competition.  I believe that the reforms outlined within the Programme will also have a positive impact on motor insurance for professional lorry and truck drivers, whose issues both I and Minister of State Fleming are aware of, from extensive consultations which took place with both the Irish Road Haulage Association and Freight Transport Association Ireland as part of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s (CIWG) first Report on motor insurance.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the first CIWG Report, published in January 2017, made 33 recommendations which aimed to improve the environment for all motor insurance customers, including lorry and truck drivers.  While most of these recommendations have been implemented, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure that any outstanding recommendations are completed as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I believe that a necessary step that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Executive Board of the Judicial Council by 28 October.  I believe that these guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and a more consistent application of making awards in courts and thus ultimately benefiting lorry and truck drivers as well as other professional drivers. <\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, making progress will be a cross-Departmental approach and we will build and expand upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group.

Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. <\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme has been one of the main tools with which we have protected the income of employees who otherwise would not be working. However, whilst I acknowledge the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, what I cannot do is mandate how temporary payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Furthermore I am specifically precluded from intervening in the case of any individual customer with any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) apply here. These mandate that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. That assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR also provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.<\/p>  <p>  This overall regulatory framework means a decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Where a formal loan offer is made by a lender, the loan offer may contain a condition that may allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the loan offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  These overlapping and complimentary regulations are designed to protect consumers, prevent risky unsustainable lending, protect the integrity of the financial system and preserve competition in the market. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800068#WRO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800068#WRO04900"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[21365\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800068#WRO05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that emergency medical technicians who are fully registered with the pre-hospital emergency care council and in possession of unendorsed C1 licences are unable to obtain insurance cover for driving ambulances in the private network in cases in which they are under 23 years of age even though they are able to do so in the national ambulance service; the actions that will be taken to address the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":671,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, as Minister for Finance I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  Indeed, the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to insurance for private ambulance services, I understand that as private businesses, they obtain insurance on the market.  My officials contacted Insurance Ireland about this and I understand from that there are a number of insurance companies who provide insurance to private ambulance operators.  In addition, such insurance may be considered a form of fleet insurance depending on the number of vehicles the service has.  Insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age and type of vehicles, the number of drivers, and how the vehicle is used.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose. Insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and many have exclusions as to the age of drivers on such fleet policies.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to the specific case in the details supplied, the relevant individuals and private ambulance providers should contact their insurer or broker directly to see if a solution is available.  In addition, if an individual is having difficulty in receiving an insurance quotation, or a private company has issues in relation to named drivers on their fleet policy, they may wish to use the Declined Cases Agreement (DCA).  Under the terms of the DCA, which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland, the insurance market will not refuse to provide insurance to an individual seeking insurance if the person has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them.  In this regard, there are further details available on the Insurance Ireland website, while more generally, Insurance Ireland also operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. The relevant contact details are: feedback@insuranceireland.eu or declined@insuranceireland.eu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800068#WRO05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800068#WRO05200"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[21400\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800068#WRO05300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if issues raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) regarding insurance for the sport horse industry will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister for Finance, to comment on individual cases such as that of his constituent.  However, the issue of the cost and availability of insurance for many businesses and consumers is an issue that both Minister of State Fleming and I are very much aware of.  <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative measure to remedy this issue and there are also many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address it, in particular the fact that it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied, or direct insurance companies as to their pricing levels.  As referenced in relation to award levels in the details supplied, I believe that a necessary step that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Executive Board of the Judicial Council by 28 October.  I believe that these guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and a more consistent application of making awards in courts and thus ultimately benefiting consumers and businesses such as referred to by the Deputy. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, I can assure the Deputy that the Government is actively prioritising reform of the insurance sector with particular emphasis on motor, public liability and employer liability insurance, the latter two of which are very relevant to the equestrian sector.  In that regard, the &ldquo;Programme for Government &ndash; Our shared Future&rdquo; document lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.

Also, the new property must be occupied as the sole or main residence of a first time purchaser.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.

The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund. The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.<\/p>  <p>  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation (that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution).<\/p>  <p>  When a fund pays an amount out to an investor it triggers a &lsquo;chargeable event&rsquo;.

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies. <\/p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  For example, in relation to motor insurance, factors may include those such as the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience, as well as the age and type of vehicle, how and where the vehicle is used, the claims record, the number of drivers, and the location of storage. Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, the issue raised in the questions demonstrates why it is important for consumers to shop around on their insurance policies.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one.  Their website also includes a car insurance shopping around checklist and other tips on cutting car insurance costs which may prove useful to consumers. <\/p>  <p>  I would also note that if a consumer has a complaint with the service of their insurance provider, it is advisable that they make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-5677000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800069#WRP03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Yield","counter":705,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800069#WRP03100"},{"type":"question","counter":706,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[21931\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800069#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated amount the carbon tax will raise in view of the proposed increases in the carbon tax as outlined in the programme for Government in each of the years 2021 to 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":707,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[22078\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800069#WRP03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount extra an increase of &euro;7.50 per tonne in the carbon tax, as outlined in the programme for Government will raise in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":708,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 292 and 297 together.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government sets out increases in the carbon tax rate from 2021 to 2030, to reach &euro;100 per tonne CO2 by 2030.

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.<\/p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. <\/p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p><p>I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p><p>I understand that, as part of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), which is overseen by my Department, a paper is likely to be published soon setting out the consideration of policy matters that arose during a preliminary review of the tax treatment of married and co-habiting couples.  The expectation is that it will be published in the coming weeks as part of the regular Budget process. In 2019, my Department carried out a review of the Home Carer Credit which also examined some of the issues around the current tax treatment of married and co-habiting couples.

In their reply, the CBI indicated that as the information sought by the Deputy relates to their day-to-day supervisory work of insurers and reinsurers, they are precluded from providing a response to your question.  They also noted that they do not divulge firm specific information with respect to their supervisory activities.  However, the CBI did state that it has set out its position in relation to dividend distributions and variable remuneration (including bonuses) by insurers (including reinsurers) on its website. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, in relation to the payment of dividends specifically, the CBI notes that the impact of COVID-19 on the solvency and liquidity positions of insurance firms remains uncertain, but it is likely to be significant for many of the insurance firms under its supervision.  In this context, the CBI considers that insurance firms should postpone any payment of dividend distributions or similar transactions until they can forecast their costs and future revenues with a greater degree of certainty.  Where the board of an insurance firm forms the view that a high level of certainty has been reached and wishes to make a distribution, the CBI expects the firm to engage with its supervision team before proceeding with the distribution, demonstrating satisfactory forward looking solvency, liquidity and operational resilience positions in light of the current environment.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the payment of bonuses, the CBI informed my officials that it expects firms to exercise prudence in respect of their variable remuneration policies, including considering whether postponement of related payments would be appropriate during this time.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the CBI notes that both approaches above are consistent with the relevant statement published by EIOPA on 2 April and the recommendation of the ESRB on 8 June.

Meetings have either followed an ad-hoc request for technical information (e.g. STO&rsquo;s) or ongoing support over a long period of time (e.g. 5 AML regulation). <\/p><p>I measure the effectiveness of the working group not by the number of times it has met, but by the work that the department has produced, the quality of the briefings and the reputation is has built in Ireland, at EU and global level, in a very complex topic. I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Department&rsquo;s website which contains additional information at the following link:  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/67039d-b\/  <\/p><p>As an example of the effectiveness of the working group, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the following: <\/p><p>- Engagement at European level:<\/p><p>- the European Commission&rsquo;s Fintech Action plan report<\/p><p>- the EU Blockchain Observatory &amp;amp; Forum.<\/p><p>- the European Blockchain Partnership.<\/p><p>- European Commission&rsquo;s consultation on cryptoassets.<\/p><p>- INATBA ()<\/p><p>- Engagement at Global level:<\/p><p>- Member of OECD&rsquo;s Ad hoc Expert Group on Finance and Digitalisation<\/p><p>- Member of OECD&rsquo;s Blockchain Advisory Group<\/p><p>- Member of Government Blockchain Association (GBA)<\/p><p>- Member of Global Digital Finance (GDF)<\/p><p>- Member of World Economic Forum &ndash; Digital Currency Governance Consortium<\/p><p>Additionally, I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the work undertaken by the working group to engage experts and liaise with stakeholders, in order to continue to build upon the Department&rsquo;s knowledge of this technology. An example of this was the hosting of a government wide blockchain event in late January 2019, when the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance hosted a &lsquo;blockchain hackathon&rsquo; in the Trinity Innovation Centre.

The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 also contains a related commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process. <\/p>  <p>  The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. <\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual line Departments in the first instance. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to facilitate the initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives. <\/p>  <p>  To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is a legal obligation, referred to as the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty, and it originates in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are members of the Expert Advisory group and the Public Sector Duty is reflected in all Equality Budgeting policies as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality, commissioned the OECD to undertake a Policy Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. This was published in tandem with Budget 2020. The report reviews Ireland&rsquo;s equality budgeting programme and provides recommendations on its further development, in light of international experience. <\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the OECD recommendations has already commenced. This work is being guided by the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and work is well underway, most notably on OECD recommendation 9, which calls for the development of an equality data strategy to further bolster the impact of equality budgeting.<\/p>  <p>  Monitoring and reporting from a given dimension of equality is only possible if the necessary disaggregated data is available. With this in mind, the CSO have conducted a data audit to evaluate the quality of existing administrative datasets from an equality perspective. This audit has been guided by a sub-group of the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group, and a report will be published in the coming weeks. Having a comprehensive understanding of the data landscape is a necessary prerequisite to implementing the remaining recommendations of the OECD report. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the &lsquo;Programme for Government - Our Shared Future&rsquo;, the Government has committed to developing a set of wellbeing indicators to give a more rounded, holistic view of how our society is faring.  A set of indicators will be developed to create a broader context for policy-making, to include a balanced scorecard for each area of public policy, focused on outcomes and the impact that those policies have on individuals and communities. The overriding focus is to improve the wellbeing of the Irish people and society. <\/p>  <p>  The development of this work will be informed by the experience of other jurisdictions, which have developed similar measures in recent years. Through the Department of the Taoiseach, a group of experts will be convened to guide this work.    <\/p>  <p>  Through my Department's responsibility for Performance and Equality budgeting, work is already underway in examining developments in this area, particularly regarding international best practice. Leveraging the experience in identifying metrics which maximise transparency and accountability, and utilising the guidance we provide to line Departments in identifying the most appropriate measures to inform resource allocation decisions that make a positive impact of people's lives, my Department will play a key role in working with the Department of the Taoiseach and with colleagues across Government in delivering this work.   <\/p>  <p>  Once developed, the Government will ensure that a well-being framework can be utilised in a systematic way across public policy-making at local and national levels, in setting budgetary priorities, evaluating programmes and reporting on progress. This will be an important complement to existing economic measurement tools that are in place to support well-being and outcomes-based approaches to policy making.<\/p>  <p>  One such existing tool is the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH Model, which will continue to be utilised to help Government understand the impact of proposed reforms on households. Moreover, initiatives such as the Spending Review process, which is a key platform for evidence-informed policy making across the Civil Service, will continue to produce evidence relevant to the wellbeing and outcomes of people, households, businesses and sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Taken as a whole, a broad range of initiatives are under way to advance the objectives of equality budgeting, and in particular to promote transparency and accountability in reporting across the budget cycle. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800070#WRQ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes","counter":780,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800070#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":319,"qnumall":"[21310\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800070#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding flooding in Kenmare, County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>The Flood Risk Management Plans launched by Minister of State Kevin &lsquo;Boxer&rsquo; Moran in May 2018 include a recommendation to progress the project-level development and planning of nine new Flood Relief Schemes for County Kerry, (Tralee, Kenmare, Banna, Abbeydorney, Ballylongford, Castleisland and Tullig, Dingle, Killarney and Listowel).<\/p>  <p>  A steering group, comprising of representatives from the Office of Public Works and Kerry County Council, is already in place to progress a number of these schemes, including the Kenmare Flood Relief Scheme.

Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country.  Recent capital schemes are being informed by the strategic <i>Review of Arts Centres and Venues<\/i>commissioned by the Arts Council and CCMA, as well as the Arts Council's published <i>Arts Centre Policy and Strategy 2019<\/i>which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.<\/p><p>The principal mechanism through which my Department directly supports arts and culture at local authority level is the Creative Ireland Programme &ndash; a culture-based programme led by my Department and designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition being that participation in cultural activity by everyone drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.<\/p><p>A Memorandum of Understanding is in place between my Department and that of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the objective of which is a commitment to support the implementation and delivery of Pillar 2 of the Programme &ndash; Creative Communities - over the period 2019-2022.  This support recognises that culture and creativity are essential to sustaining and developing vibrant communities and places throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>Each local authority has been supported in the publication of a 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategy following local public consultation.  The strategies are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area, the vision and values of each local authority and their strategic priorities. Each local authority has established a Culture and Creativity Team, led by a Creative Ireland Coordinator, to oversee its implementation.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year, 3-year Service Level Agreements (SLAs) were signed between my Department and each of the 31 Local Authorities reflecting the commitment of both Departments to continue to financially support their delivery of the Creative Ireland Programme until 2022, subject to annual budgetary processes. This year total core funding of &euro;3 million, or approx. &euro;97,000 per local authority, is being made available to enable them to continue the implementation of their strategies.<\/p><p>Also encompassed by these SLAs is a separate commitment by my Department to provide funding of &euro;15,000 to each local authority (or &euro;75,000 in the case of each of the four Dublin local authorities) to support the annual delivery of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; our national day of free creative activities for children and young people under 18 years of age.

Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning, and other stakeholders.  Historical accuracy, academic integrity and archival discovery will be key tenets of the commemorative programme for the forthcoming period.  <\/p>  <p>  - A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations - between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including appropriate cross-border initiatives.  Local authorities will continue to have a leading role in supporting and driving community-led commemoration, augmented with appropriate State assistance and participation, which will be determined on a case by case basis. <\/p>  <p>  - The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1921 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives. Artistic and creative endeavours will have an important role in encouraging reflection, exploration and debate, allowing people of all traditions to reflect on challenging and sensitive issues.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800074#WRW02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":955,"qnumday":379,"qnumall":"[22285\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800074#WRW02200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding which is allocated to Decade of Centenaries commemorations and other commemorative events by her Department for 2020.","asker":"1485","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":956,"content":"<p>As the Minister with responsibility for leading the Decade of Centenaries commemorative programme, my priority is to ensure that the Government's approach to the remembrance of the significant historical events and related themes of the period from 1920 to 1923 is appropriate, measured, respectful, inclusive and sensitive to the different perspectives that persist on the events of this period.<\/p><p>The public health emergency caused by Covid-19 has impacted significantly on the scope for 'in-person' commemorative events and my Department is engaged with our partners and stakeholders to address the challenges presented in order to continue to deliver the Decade of Centenaries programme in a safe and meaningful way.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the challenges presented by the pandemic, the approach taken to programme development and delivery will continue to be informed by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations - specifically, the principles laid down in the Advisory Group's Second <i>Statement (<\/i>) which was published in October 2017, and also the most recent specific guidance from this Group <i>(<\/i>), published in January 2019.

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application\/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the scheme is &lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;  This approach also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is now operational, where a decline of at least 30% in future turnover is projected for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020 for a participating business.  <\/p>  <p>  Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  There are exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.<\/p>  <p>  For applicants whose post-TWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS 19 Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan and will enable them to commence the property search.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800074#WRW04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Title","counter":985,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800074#WRW04900"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[21696\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800074#WRW05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if consideration of a submission on the registration of the title of a property (details supplied) on Main Street, Croom, County Limerick, by the Property Registration Authority will be expedited in view of the fact the delay is holding up a village renewal scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":987,"content":"<p>In relation to any specific cases with the Property Registration Authority (PRA), arrangements have been put in place to facilitate the provision of information directly to members of the Oireachtas.

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic.  <\/p><p>As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available. This is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 situation has had an unprecedented economic impact and unfortunately some applicants for the RIHL have been affected. In order to address this issue, my Department has issued guidance to local authorities on the process for dealing with applicants already in the application\/approval process whose economic circumstances have changed for the worse. These options could include reducing, suspending or withdrawing the amount that can be borrowed. However, there is no one size fits all approach, it depends on the individual circumstances.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, the fact that an applicant&rsquo;s income is supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a factor that must be taken into account. As noted on Revenue&rsquo;s website, employers&rsquo; participation in the scheme is <i>&lsquo;a declaration which states that, based on reasonable projections, there will be, as a result of disruption to the business caused or to be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline of at least 25% in the future turnover of, or customer orders for, the business for the duration of the pandemic and that as a result the employer cannot pay normal wages and outgoings fully but nonetheless wants to retain its employees on the payroll.&rsquo;<\/i>Given that the ability to repay a mortgage is based upon a careful assessment of an applicant&rsquo;s employment situation, the fact that their employer has declared that they are unable to pay normal wages must be taken into consideration. <\/p><p>Therefore, on 6 July, my Department issued a Circular including additional guidance on the treatment of persons whose employers avail of the TWSS as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post TWSS has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months. This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. Local authorities can, however, use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate. <\/p><p>There are exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.<\/p><p>For applicants whose post-TWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS 19 Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan and will enable them to commence the property search.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Supports","counter":1011,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1012,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[21162\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the annual cost of family hubs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":1013,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[21163\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the estimated cost to set a 14 day-limit on stays in family hubs to ensure all families are moved to more sustainable accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1014,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 399 together.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of emergency accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. <\/p><p>In relation to the operational funding for the family hubs, my Department provides funding to housing authorities on a regional basis towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services.

Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of the funding arrangements with my Department.  Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services are a matter for those authorities.  In addition, the cost of operating individual hubs will vary based on factors such as a the location and numbers of families being accommodated in the hub.

As families are provided with accommodation until such time as a home is secured, it is not possible to provide costings based on a 14-day limit on the duration of a stay in a family hub. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1015,"content":"<p>Question No. 399 answered with Question No. 398.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Data","counter":1016,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1017,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[21164\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800075#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount of land owned by the State that has been zoned for residential development; the estimated number of housing units that could be built on such land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1018,"content":"<p>Given the diversity of state bodies and agencies and multiplicity of landholdings for a range of different purposes, there isn&rsquo;t currently one central comprehensive database of all lands in state ownership.

Section 3.2.3 of the Guidelines suggests that in areas &ldquo;under major urban influence&rdquo;, planning authorities may define &ldquo;rural generated&rdquo; housing need for &ldquo;Persons who are an intrinsic part of the rural community&rdquo; and for &ldquo;Persons working full-time or part-time in rural areas&rdquo;.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (the NPF) provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from uncoordinated and ribbon-type development, in order to avoid over-development of those areas.<\/p>  <p>  National Policy Objective 15 is supplemented by National Policy Objective 19, which aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining.  NPF Policy NPO19 is intended to tie in with the generally established Guidelines approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002.  Given the many changes in policy and in wider society since 2002\/5, the superseding of the NSS by the National Planning Framework (NPF) in 2018, together with other factors, the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines now require updating, in a broader rural development and settlement context.

Following receipt of such a proposal, the Minister requests the Director of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to conduct an assessment of the area to establish whether or not it meets the criteria for designation and to report to the Minister on whether the area should be designated as a Rent Pressure Zone. For the purpose of the Act, &lsquo;area&rsquo; is defined as either the administrative area of a housing authority or a local electoral area within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government Act 2001. <\/p><p>Previously, for an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must have satisfied the criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016), as follows:  <\/p><p>(i) the annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and  <\/p><p>(ii) the average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (i.e the National Standardised Rent in the RTB&rsquo;s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter (&euro;1,231 per month in Q1 2020).  <\/p><p>However, on 30 May 2019, the previous Minister signed the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (Commencement) Order 2019 which appointed 31 May 2019 and 4 June 2019 as the dates on which specified provisions of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 came into effect, including provisions in respect of the average rent qualifying criterion for RPZ designation.Specifically, in relation to criteria (ii) above, the rent of a dwelling in the Greater Dublin Area (Kildare, Wicklow and Meath) will now be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Dublin rents; and the rent of a dwelling outside of the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) will be compared to the average rent across the country, excluding Greater Dublin Area rents.<\/p><p>Each quarterly RTB Rent Index Report includes a summary in Table 9 of the data used to establish whether each Local Electoral Area fulfils the criteria for designation as a Rent Pressure Zone. This ensures transparency in relation to the position of individual areas in terms of average rent levels and increases. The quarterly Rent Index Reports are available to view on the RTB's website at the following link: <\/p><p>Further information on Rent Pressure Zones and designations is available on my Department's website at , by searching 'rent pressure zones - information'.  <\/p><p>While rental inflation in the Westport  LEA has been above 7% in 1 of the last 6 quarters, the standardised average rent in Westport in Q1 2020 was &euro;797.41, which is below the Non-GDA Standardised Average Rent of &euro;870.00 per month, thereby not satisfying the criteria for designation as an RPZ at this time.<\/p><p>The Housing Agency and the RTB will continue to monitor national rents and if the Westport LEA meets the designation criteria it will be designated as a RPZ.  <\/p><p>In relation to Rent reviews outside of Rent Pressure Zones, a landlord may only review the rent once in any two-year period. Section 19 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004-2019 requires that the rent set is not above the market rents for similar properties in that area. The landlord must provide three examples of rents for similar properties in a comparable area to demonstrate this.

The second scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body or Private Company to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (Private Mortgage to Rent).  The schemes are targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), who agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and are deemed eligible for social housing support.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and are important parts of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process.<\/p><p>Information in relation to the Local Authority MTR scheme from its inception in 2013 to end 2019 is available on my Department's website under the heading Local Authority Mortgage to Rent at the following link:  During that period, a total of 497 households had benefited from the scheme and of this number 14 cases were completed by Donegal County Council. <\/p><p>From the introduction of the Private MTR scheme in 2012 to the end of June 2020, 691 families have remained in their homes under the scheme.

As of end-June 2020, 1,342 applications were active and of this number 20 applications are from households in Donegal.The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme including a local authority status report which shows a breakdown of the number active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases per local authority.  This information is available on the Agency's website at the following link:   <\/p><p>A review of the Private MTR scheme undertaken in 2017 introduced a range of improvements to the eligibility criteria and its administration.

In transitioning to the deep retrofit implementation, my Department has requested local authorities to achieve a 'B2' or equivalent building energy rating for their housing stock. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme, energy efficiency improvements have also been incorporated into the approximately 11,000 vacant social housing homes that have been returned to productive use under the Voids Programme since 2014. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the 'Just Transition' proposals for the midlands region, Budget 2020 also made provision for &euro;20 million to fund energy efficiency upgrades to local authority houses in the affected counties as a pilot programme. As well as retrofitting social housing stock in the midlands, the programme also aims to create opportunities for retrofitting of private housing with support from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  <\/p>  <p>  This Programme is being developed under a Retrofit Taskforce and has involved my Department working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment, the SEAI and the relevant local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, a national retrofitting plan is due to be rolled out in 2021 led by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment.  The midlands pilot along with other pilot schemes which are due to commence rollout in early 2021, will be used to test key elements of the national plan and my Department will work with the Department of Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment in this work.  The targets set within the Climate Action Plan will see 500,000 homes nationally, retrofitted by end 2030, including private and social homes.  This will build on the investment already made in retrofitting of social homes and the improved comfort levels and addressing of fuel poverty which have resulted. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800077#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":1128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800077#WRZ01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1129,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[22407\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800077#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the proposed wind energy development guidelines will be published following the recent public consultation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1130,"content":"<p>My Department is currently undertaking a focused review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines in line with the &ldquo;preferred draft approach&rdquo; which was announced in June 2017 by the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, in conjunction with the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

Other countries and regions with which we have bilateral programmes have likewise temporarily suspended their reciprocal arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  We continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation here and in the relevant locations abroad, in terms particularly of public health advice, travel restrictions, job opportunities and the availability of short-term accommodation. We will instruct our Missions abroad to re-open the application processes when circumstances allow young people to benefit from a working holiday here and to fully experience Ireland&rsquo;s culture and way of life.  We will also take account of the resumption of working holiday arrangements in the relevant locations abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800078#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800078#WRAA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[22529\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800078#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide a schedule of advisers, special advisers and seconded civil servants working in his Department appointed and or recruited and or in an acting capacity; the roles and responsibilities attributed to each; and the salary scale for each role in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>On the commencement of every D&aacute;il, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issues guidelines setting out the arrangements for the staffing of Ministerial Offices.

The Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to an appropriate education.<\/p><p>The enrolment of a child in a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and then a matter for the school\/ Board of Management having regard to their own enrolment\/admissions policy.<\/p><p>My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools. Waiting lists are a matter for the individual schools. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required. <\/p><p>The SENOs are available to assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs and to discuss their child's special educational needs.  The NCSE also works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. Contact details are available on www.tusla.ie.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>Schools have been notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2020\/21.  The arrangements include the following provisions:<\/p><p>- 2019\/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030\/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020\/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way. <\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process<\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications  for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered for within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process.  <\/p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020\/21 school year. <\/p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. <\/p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800080#WRCC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":1332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800080#WRCC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1333,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[21518\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800080#WRCC04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if matters raised in correspondence (details supplied) will be addressed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1334,"content":"<p>The conditions for returning to work after a period of sick leave are set out in Circular 54\/2019 Paragraph 12 of Chapter 1.

Schools will be advised that they will have an option of an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board should they continue to experience difficulties, having first taken measures necessary to achieve physical distancing in line with published guidance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800081#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1361,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[21631\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800081#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the procedures in place for the resuming of practical subjects in secondary schools and the logistics of running home economic classes when the schools reopen in view of the fact that the roadmap omitted these complex subjects and teachers have received no guidance in relation to restarting; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1362,"content":"<p>My Department recently published guidance for post primary schools &lsquo;<i>Return to School Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; <\/i>in relation to subjects that involve using equipment in order to support the safe implementation of the practical aspects of those subjects.

While clear guidance was provided to schools in avoiding bias during the process of estimating marks for their students, it is inevitable that some schools will have been overly harsh in their estimations while others will have been overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated percentage mark. <\/p>  <p>  The standardisation process seeks to bring schools into line with each other across a national standard. This results in some estimated marks being reduced while others will have increased. This process also ensures that the results issued in 2020 will have the same status as those issued in previous or future years.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate results from any one year are considered equivalent to the results from any other year. This is because the results each year are subject to a process of national standardisation through the marking processes undertaken by the State Examinations Commission.  This year, the national standardisation process combines the school-sourced data and certain historical data to ensure the Calculated Grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools and with a national standard.  <\/p>  <p>  On 1 September, I announced details in relation to the Calculated Grades model following approval of proposals made to Government. The change proposed removed the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model. I was conscious that the use of such data had been criticised in public commentary about calculated grades and that it had led in other jurisdictions to accusations that students attending disadvantaged schools in those jurisdictions were at risk of being treated unfairly. <\/p>  <p>  The change made placed a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students. The process, through the examination and adjustment of estimated percentage marks from schools, still fulfilled its key role of ensuring that the calculated grades iron out the unfairness that could arise when different schools applied various standards when judging the performance of students.<\/p>  <p>  Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process have been published on the date of issue of the results.  To issue the technical detail of the modelling process in advance of the release of grades would risk detracting from the core principle of providing the most fair and equitable set of results for each candidate.

In the 2019\/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the public health advice published in early July, my Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020\/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020\/2021 school year.  <\/p>  <p>  The closing date for payment for the 2020\/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020.  All children who are eligible for school transport and who applied and paid by the deadline have been accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated.  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.<\/p>  <p>Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th   August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.   This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of this advice it was decided by Government that the operation of post-primary school transport services would commence operation when schools re-open pending the development of additional measures to support physical distancing on the post primary buses. My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann to implement these measures on a rolling basis. <\/p>  <p>  Given the timing of this most recent advice from NPHET so close to the start of the new term, my Department is not withdrawing post-primary transport services as to do so would cause difficulty for many families in getting their children to school.  My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services and services for children of post-primary school going age will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. <\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is conducting a full assessment to see where re-organisation or re-scheduling of services is possible. In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently invited applications from operators who wish to be considered for the provision of additional post-primary services that may be required. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800083#WRFF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1514,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800083#WRFF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1515,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[22017\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800083#WRFF04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the formula for the leaving certificate 2020 examinations will be made public in full detail (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1516,"content":"<p>The design of the Calculated Grades model was informed by advice from a Technical Working Group comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the Inspectorate of my Department, the Educational Research Centre, and international external expertise.<\/p>  <p>  The standardisation process undertaken was an iterative statistical modelling, which by its very nature, was an evolving model.<\/p>  <p>  Research makes clear that because teacher judgments are made in the context of each school, they need to be examined and adjusted at a national level to ensure comparability across different schools and that a common national standard is applied.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will have taken different approaches to providing estimated percentage marks for their students. While clear guidance was provided to schools in avoiding bias during the process of estimating marks for their students, it is inevitable that some schools will have been overly harsh in their estimations while others will have been overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated percentage mark. <\/p>  <p>  The standardisation process seeks to bring schools into line with each other across a national standard. This results in some estimated marks being reduced while others will have increased. This process also ensures that the results issued in 2020 will have the same status as those issued in previous or future years.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate results from any one year are considered equivalent to the results from any other year. This is because the results each year are subject to a process of national standardisation through the marking processes undertaken by the State Examinations Commission.  This year, the national standardisation process combines the school-sourced data and certain historical data to ensure the Calculated Grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools and with a national standard.  <\/p>  <p>  On 1 September, I announced details in relation to the Calculated Grades model following approval of proposals made to Government. The change proposed removed the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model. I was conscious that the use of such data had been criticised in public commentary about calculated grades and that it had led in other jurisdictions to accusations that students attending disadvantaged schools in those jurisdictions were at risk of being treated unfairly. <\/p>  <p>  The change made placed a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students. The process, through the examination and adjustment of estimated percentage marks from schools, still fulfilled its key role of ensuring that the calculated grades iron out the unfairness that could arise when different schools applied various standards when judging the performance of students.<\/p>  <p>  Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process have been published on the date of issue of the results.  To issue the technical detail of the modelling process in advance of the release of grades would risk detracting from the core principle of providing the most fair and equitable set of results for each candidate. It may have also increased anxiety levels among students as they may have begun to speculate on the final grade they were to receive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800083#WRFF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1517,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800083#WRFF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1518,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[22018\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800083#WRFF05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if clear guidelines will be issued for primary and secondary schools on drop off and collection of students in view of the significant issues experienced over the recent reopening of schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1519,"content":"<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act, 1998 the board of management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school.

This will facilitate preparatory works to be completed in schools to facilitate reopening such as refurbishment of toilets and reconfiguration of school spaces.<\/p><p>The additional per capita funding being provided for pupils in special schools and special classes recognises the additional needs that these pupils have and the additional measures that schools may be required to take to support them.<\/p><p>Special schools and schools with special classes where there is a teaching principal will receive one release day per week.

The programme aimed to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate\/transition into their planned education setting for the new school year and help to prevent regression among children with special needs. <\/p><p>It is also recognised that some children who have complex medical or special educational needs may not be able to return to school at the end of August because the relevant public health guidelines indicate they are at &ldquo;very high risk&rdquo;. <\/p><p>These students&rsquo; schools will provide additional supports for these students through designated teachers from within the staffing resources of the school<\/p><p>Schools will have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils\/students, including pupils\/students at &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; to COVID-19.<\/p><p>During the period of school closures the Department provided schools in the primary and special school sector and at post-primary level with a series of &ldquo;Continuity of Schooling Guidance&rdquo; documents to help education professionals and parents to support children learning in a remote environment.  The events surrounding COVID-19 and the public health restrictions which resulted in the emergency closure of schools to learners has highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in how they can provide for continuity of teaching and learning in the future. <\/p><p>The continuity of teaching and learning during the emergency period was achieved with significant additional effort from all school staff working remotely to ensure students were supported during this time.  Most schools put in place arrangements to communicate with students and parents demonstrating innovation and resilience by providing flexible local responses.<\/p><p>The Department has updated its Continuity of Schooling Guidance documents to support schools in responding in an agile way in the event of localised school closure or to continue to support pupils with medical or special educational needs who cannot attend school<\/p><p>Guidance will also provide for additional strategies to support children with ASD where it is likely that the impact of school closures will have been significant so that learning experiences, routines and sensory needs should be carefully planned.<\/p><p>The National Educational Psychological Services (NEPs) and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will also support the return of children with special educational needs to schools.<\/p><p>NEPS provides a psychological service designed to support the well-being, and academic, social and emotional development of all children and young people, having particular regard for those with special educational needs (SEN).  <\/p><p>NEPS psychologists take a holistic, developmental perspective in all the work they undertake in schools, which considers the broad context of the needs of the student with the aim of supporting the school to identify how best to provide intervention and support.  <\/p><p>NEPS psychologists use a consultative model to respond to needs in their assigned schools.  They provide individual casework for students and capacity building support and development work for teachers to help schools meet the needs of all children and young people.  This is achieved by supporting the implementation of the Continuum of Support, with particular regard for those students with Special Educational Needs.<\/p><p>NEPS has developed a range of resources for schools and parents to support the well-being of children and young people in line with the <i>DES Wellbeing Framework and Policy for Practice<\/i>. <\/p><p>As noted above, NEPS has developed Wellbeing Webinars and Wellbeing Toolkits for School Staff available here.  These contain information, guidance, tips and advice for schools on how best to support the well-being of all children and young people, including those with SEN following the COVID 19 school closures. <\/p><p>NEPS has also produced a targeted well-being resource, <i>Supporting the Wellbeing of Students with Special Educational Needs Returning to School<\/i>, which is available on the gov.ie\/backtoschool webpage here. NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and guidance documents for parents and students available here to support the return to school, including advice on transition, coping and relaxation strategies, and managing stress and anxiety. Other resources for schools include guidance and advice for teachers to support students in the areas of behavioural regulation, managing stress and anxiety, as well as supporting teacher well-being and self-care.<\/p><p>At local level NEPS psychologists will continue to work with their assigned schools to support them to meet the needs of children and young people with a particular focus on those with the highest level of need as they settle into the new school year.<\/p><p>The NCSE have published a series of resources to support children, parents and teachers re integrate back to school <i><\/i>.

The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020\/2021 school year.  <\/p>  <p>Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th   August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. <\/p>  <p>  Following the most recent advice from NPHET, the Government decided that the post-primary scheme (including SEN post-primary services) would commence operation when schools re-open with additional measures in place, such as pre-assigned seating and additional hygiene and cleaning measures on services and with the rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50 per cent of passenger capacity, on the post- primary services as required.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, in order to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. <\/p>  <p>   Every effort continues to provide a safe transport service for when schools re-open.  However, if parents decide not to avail of transport services they may request a refund on the cost of their ticket for the 2020\/2021 school year. <\/p>  <p> For those children who are eligible for transport under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme and whose parents decide not to use post-primary transport for the 2020\/2021 school year, in light of the impact of most recent health advice, the Department will provide a grant to support them with the cost of private transport arrangements.

While clear guidance was provided to schools in avoiding bias during the process of estimating marks for their students, it is inevitable that some schools will have been overly harsh in their estimations while others will have been overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated percentage mark. <\/p>  <p>  The standardisation process seeks to bring schools into line with each other across a national standard. This results in some estimated marks being reduced while others will have increased. This process also ensures that the results issued in 2020 will have the same status as those issued in previous or future years.<\/p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate results from any one year are considered equivalent to the results from any other year. This is because the results each year are subject to a process of national standardisation through the marking processes undertaken by the State Examinations Commission.  This year, the national standardisation process combines the school-sourced data and certain historical data to ensure the Calculated Grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools and with a national standard.  <\/p>  <p>  On 1 September, I announced details in relation to the Calculated Grades model following approval of proposals made to Government. The change proposed removed the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model. I was conscious that the use of such data had been criticised in public commentary about calculated grades and that it had led in other jurisdictions to accusations that students attending disadvantaged schools in those jurisdictions were at risk of being treated unfairly. <\/p>  <p>  The change made placed a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students. The process, through the examination and adjustment of estimated percentage marks from schools, still fulfilled its key role of ensuring that the calculated grades iron out the unfairness that could arise when different schools applied various standards when judging the performance of students.<\/p>  <p>  Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process have been published on the date of issue of the results.  To issue the technical detail of the modelling process in advance of the release of grades would risk detracting from the core principle of providing the most fair and equitable set of results for each candidate. It may have also increased anxiety levels among students as they may have begun to speculate on the final grade they were to receive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800086#WRJJ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1673,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800086#WRJJ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1674,"qnumday":621,"qnumall":"[22429\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800086#WRJJ02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will report on the educational access difficulties for a child (details supplied)","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1675,"content":"<p>My Department provides an extensive range of supports for pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD).

Literacy and numeracy skills are crucial to a person&rsquo;s ability to access the rest of the curriculum and to develop fully as an individual, to live a satisfying and rewarding life and to participate fully in our society.  It is important therefore that children master these skills to the best of their abilities.   <\/p>  <p>  In view of this and in recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages and maths are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and post-primary schools and centres for education in Ireland. This has been the case since the foundation of the State and there is no exemption from the study of English or Maths.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish language is accorded special status in Ireland and is protected by various pieces of legislation and in particular Article 8 of our Constitution which states that &ldquo;The Irish Language as the national language is the first official language&rdquo;. The Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language. The language has particular social, historical and educational importance and is part of the unique cultural heritage of the Irish people.  It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, while exemptions from the study of Irish may be considered for pupils\/students enrolled in recognised English-medium schools, such exemptions can only be considered in the exceptional circumstances set out in Section 2.2 of Circulars 0052\/2019 &ndash; Primary and 0053\/2019 &ndash; Post-primary. Decisions on the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish were devolved to school management in previous circulars 12\/96 and M10\/94 and this remains the case in the current circulars.   <\/p>  <p>The current Circulars which were informed by an extensive public consultation process, move away from a categorical diagnostic model to a needs based model.   The Circulars are set in the context of the Special Education Teaching Allocation model that allows mainstream schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools based on their identified learning needs in school, as opposed to being based primarily upon a diagnosis of a particular disability. The granting of an exemption from the study of Irish should not be a key factor in planning for the provision of learning support for a student. Those students with ASD who are enrolled in a special class or special school will automatically qualify for an exemption by nature of their placement.  Any student who does not meet the criteria for an exemption from the study of Irish should be supported in accessing the Irish language through a differentiated approach to teaching and learning in line with their identified needs and any other supports in accordance with Guidelines for supporting pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools and with Special Educational Needs: A continuum of Support.   <\/p>  <p>  Detailed guidelines and FAQs are available on the Department&rsquo;s website together with contact details for the office dealing with queries in relation to policy and appeal issues related to exemptions from the study of Irish.   The Department strives to respond to all queries in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s Customer Charter.  The circulars include a provision for a review of their operation after the first two years of implementation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1715,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[22692\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the poor supports available to children with autism will be addressed which is resulting in these children having to travel long distances from their locality to schools that suit their needs; if her attention has been drawn to the stress long journeys can cause to the children; the steps being taken to address the issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>Ensuring that every child has a suitable school placement is a key objective of my Department.

They may continue to receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which has been extended to 1 April 2021 as part of the July Stimulus Package. <\/p><p>From 17 September 2020 until 31 January 2021 the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be paid at 3 rates depending on prior earnings.  People who previously earned over &euro;300 per week will receive &euro;300 per week, people who earned &euro;200 to &euro;300 will receive &euro;250 and people who earned less than &euro;200 will receive &euro;203.  The payment rates will be further calibrated in February and April next year.  The changes to the rate are necessary to ensure that it is targeted and sustainable.<\/p><p>In determining the appropriate rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment in the case of self-employed individuals, my Department recently announced that it will take 2019 earnings into consideration where a person files their returns to Revenue.  Prior to this, the information used for the self-employed referred to that of 2018, which is the last tax year for which complete verifiable data on self-employed income is available.  This change may provide for an increased rate of payment depending on an individual&rsquo;s particular circumstances.  Reviews can be submitted to PUPRerate@welfare.ie and should be accompanied by supporting documentation.<\/p><p>In order to give every opportunity to employed and self-employed workers to receive the highest possible rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, my Department will undertake five distinct calculations and base the individual&rsquo;s Pandemic Unemployment rate on the one that is most financially advantageous to each customer.  This will be achieved by undertaking an individual calculation of each customer&rsquo;s rate based on their earnings from employment, self-employment and from a combination of both. <\/p><p>The functionality to facilitate this calculation is currently being developed and will be in place for the re-rating of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment on the 17<sup>th<\/sup>of September.  At that point anyone who is on the reduced rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment since June and would be better off under this calculation will receive the benefit of the new calculation backdated to the rate change introduced in June. <\/p><p>In order to be eligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment an individual must have lost their employment due to the pandemic.  A self-employed person must have suffered a reduction in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work. This allows some limited scope for a self-employed person to engage in once-off or emergency work and still retain eligibility for this payment.  In this instance once-off or emergency work would mean occasional,irregular, infrequent, or isolated events, where there is a clear divergence from previous employment patterns. <\/p><p>If a person is ineligible for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment as they are engaged in regular employment, they may be entitled to income support under the jobseekers schemes depending on their circumstances.  The maximum weekly rate for the jobseekers schemes is &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for any qualifying adults and children. <\/p><p>The information published online regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment has changed over the last number of months to reflect the evolution of the payment from an initial 6 week emergency income support, to that of an ongoing support now available until April 2021, for those who may need it.<\/p><p>Key changes to the payment &ldquo;rules&rdquo; include the following, all of which were published on the Pandemic Unemployment Page or related pages, on the Gov.ie website;<\/p><p>- The increase in the value of the payment to &euro;350 from an initial rate of &euro;203 on 24 March 2020<\/p><p>- The initial extension of the payment until August 10, as announced on 5 June 2020<\/p><p>- The COVID-19 Pandemic  Unemployment Payment Rate Changes announced on 3 July 2020<\/p><p>- The need to confirm eligibility to continue to receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in July 2020<\/p><p>- The extension of the payment to April 2021, and associated new payment rates, announced as part  of the July Stimulus package on 23 July 2020<\/p><p>- The ability of self-employed people to access a re-rate service for their COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment should they be dissatisfied with the payment rate allocated to them<\/p><p>- Access to COVID-19 Enhanced Illness Benefit and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for people living in Direct Provision on 7 August 2020.<\/p><p>The requirement to be genuinely seeking work is a long standing statutory requirement for anyone in receipt of a jobseekers payment and also applies to the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. To continue to maintain entitlement to this payment a person must satisfy the &ldquo;genuinely seeking work&rdquo; condition.  The Department has been clear that it will take a reasonable and flexible approach by not enforcing this condition in respect of workers who remain temporarily laid off in sectors that have not re-opened (e.g. bars, arts and entertainment) due to Covid-19 restrictions, and who are expected to return to their employment when their sector of occupation re-opens.  This update was made to the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment page on the Department website on 27 July 2020. <\/p><p>My Department cannot estimate the cost of maintaining the Pandemic Unemployment Rate at the &euro;350 rate for people who work in the arts and entertainment industry as they may be categorised as working in other technical sectors\/industries.<\/p><p>On 14 August I announced that applications have opened for the Enterprise Support Grant.  The Enterprise Support Grant previously supported entrepreneurs who were setting up new enterprises but has now been revamped to specifically provide once-off supports for self-employed people who have been severely impacted and have had to cease operations as a result of the Pandemic.  The grant of up to &euro;1000 is designed to help the self- employed small business owners who transition from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment to re-open their business.  It will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises that are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants.  A person must apply for the Enterprise Support Grant within 4 weeks of closing their Pandemic Unemployment Payment claim.  Details on the application process to access this grant is available on <i>www.gov.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>In recognition of the severe impact of COVID-19 on the Pubs  Industry the Government has announced a further &euro;16 million support package for pubs, bars and niteclubs.  Details of the package are available on the Department of Trade Enterprise and Employment website at <i>www.dbei.ie<\/i><\/p><p>Where a person is experiencing financial hardship they can apply for assistance through the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments.

I want to assure the Deputy that the purpose of the emergency measure, which relates to redundancy entitlements following temporary periods of lay-off and short-time work due to Covid-19, is to ensure that employees have a continued link to their job, have a pathway to return to their employment and also to mitigate the serious risks to businesses and jobs.  <\/p>  <p>  The existing provisions of Section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 (as amended) were not considered adequate to deal with the current Covid-19 emergency situation. As a result of Covid-19, there have been immediate and unprecedented volumes of temporary lay-offs and short-time work.  Under the existing timelines set out in Section 12 of the Act, this could have resulted in a large number of redundancies over a very short period of time.  Employers are obliged to pay redundancy entitlements to employees who have been temporarily laid off after the periods of time currently provided for in Section 12.  This would have serious unintended and detrimental financial impacts on businesses and employees and would have an adverse impact on the potential for a business to recover which could result in insolvency situations.   This would only exacerbate the risk of further permanent job losses. <\/p>  <p>  For these reasons emergency legislation was enacted which temporarily suspended the provisions of section 12 for the emergency period.  The suspension was considered vital to ensure the future viability of businesses which in turn will help prevent further permanent job losses.  In light of the on-going emergency situation the end date of the emergency measure was extended to 17th September so that businesses can continue to recover and plan their future staffing requirements. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that an employee&rsquo;s right to claim redundancy after a temporary period of lay-off or short-time has not been removed; rather, it has been deferred for a temporary period in this unprecedented emergency situation. <\/p>  <p>  The matter of a further extension beyond 17th September is currently under consideration.  In its deliberations the Government will have regard to the public health and labour market situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":1771,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1772,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[21110\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK06600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when appointments for the public services card will be reinstated; and the mitigation measures put in place by her Department to enable persons without a card to apply for free travel and other social welfare entitlement which require a card.","asker":"1466","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1773,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[21858\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK06700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when appointments for public services cards will resume; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1774,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[22145\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800087#WRKK06800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when scheduling for appointments for the public services card will commence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1775,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 651, 703 and 732 together.<\/p><p>The SAFE registration process, which my Department uses to authenticate a person's identity, is a face- to-face process which results in the issuing of a Public Services Card (PSC). <\/p><p>At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, my Department temporarily postponed the SAFE registration process.

The scheme provides financial incentives to private sector employers to hire people with a disability for between 21 and 39 subsidised hours per week under a contract of employment. <\/p><p>The basic rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour giving a total annual subsidy available of &euro;10,748 per annum based on a 39 hour week. The contract of employment offered must be for a minimum of 6 months and the employee should be subject to and have the same rights as per the conditions of employment as any of the other employees. Included in these conditions is the requirement that the employee must be paid the going rate for the job which must be at least the statutory minimum wage. The subsidy rate contribution under this scheme is not linked to the statutory minimum wage - it is a subsidy claimed, subject to certain conditions, against the cost incurred where a productivity shortfall arises from a disability. <\/p><p>The financial supports for employers are structured under three separate strands and companies could benefit under one strand or under two or three strands simultaneously, as the case may be, depending on the number of people with a disability employed, as below.<\/p><p>- Strand I is a general subsidy for any perceived productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison to a colleague without a disability.  The subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.<\/p><p>- Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with disabilities who are supported by a Wage Subsidy Scheme Strand I payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work based costs relating to such employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number of employees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability. Therefore when an employer has 23 or more Wage Subsidy Scheme employees a 50% top-up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;7.95 per hour for each employee. <table>    <tr>       <th>No.<\/th>       <th>%<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3 to 6 employees with a disability <\/td>       <td>10%  top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>7 to 11 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>20%  top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12 to 16 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>30%  top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>17 to 22 employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>40%  top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>23 + employees with a disability<\/td>       <td>50%  top-up of wage subsidy paid<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>- Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 25 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p>Estimated expenditure on the Wage Subsidy Scheme in 2020 is expected to be in the region of &euro;24 million. Based on current participant numbers, increasing the current base hourly rate of subsidy from &euro;5.30 to &euro;7.07 (70% of minimum wage level) is estimated at an additional annual cost in excess of &euro;8.7 million, including the knock-on effect of the percentage increases arising due to payment of Strand II. <\/p><p>The Wage Subsidy Scheme is designed to encourage private sector employers to offer substantial and sustainable employment to people with disabilities by providing financial incentives to employers who offer employment of at least 21 hours per week. It is not designed as a subsidy for part-time work offered. It is not possible to provide a reliable estimate on the cost of reducing the minimum number of hours worked under the Wage Subsidy Scheme from 21 to 15.  The WSS is a demand-led scheme, there is no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the increased costs resulting from an increase in employers applying for a wage subsidy in respect of part-time employees. <\/p><p>Through the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Government recognises the importance for people with disabilities of participation in employment.  As part of the Strategy, my Department is committed to improving employment outcomes and removing barriers to employment for persons with disabilities. The supports provided have been designed to enable people with a disability to achieve their employment ambitions by focusing on the individual&rsquo;s ability and capacity.  The Department offers a range of supports to people with disabilities who may not be in a position to, or wish to, work full-time.  Some of these supports include:<\/p><p>- The Department&rsquo;s INTREO service is available to any person with a disability who wishes to avail of the service.

This is an increase of just under 9% and will increase the annual Fuel Allowance payment from &euro;630 to &euro;686, a &euro;56 yearly increase.  The annual cost of this increase in Fuel Allowance is &euro;21m.  This cost has been funded via a ring-fenced allocation from the circa &euro;90m which will be raised from the Carbon Tax increase.  This is the largest single allocation and is directly aimed at protecting the most vulnerable.  <\/p><p>Income support is only part of the answer in terms of addressing energy costs.  One of the best ways to tackle energy costs in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  In this regard it was also announced in Budget 2020 that a total of &euro;52.8 million is being made available to retrofit the homes of people living in or at risk of energy poverty through the Warmer Homes Scheme.  This represents the biggest ever allocation for the Warmer Homes Scheme &ndash; more than double the initial allocation for 2019.  &euro;13 million of this funding is ring-fenced revenue arising from the increase in the carbon tax.  This reduces the energy required to adequately heat a home, thus reducing a household&rsquo;s exposure to increases in energy costs. <\/p><p>In terms of the forthcoming budget, the Government will consider how it can support people on low incomes and those on social welfare payments.

The pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) scheme is subject to conditionality, in particular the requirement to be resident in Ireland to receive the payment under the scheme. <\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended, social welfare inspectors have powers to attend at ports and airports and make enquiries for the purposes of the control and compliance of social welfare schemes.<i><\/i>In recent months, against the backdrop of the Covid19 pandemic, inspectors made enquiries of persons who were leaving the State. The nature of these enquiries was very limited and the information collected was also limited to that which was necessary to determine if the person was in receipt of a payment that they were not entitled to receive if they were leaving the State. <\/p><p>Given the employment effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the high proportion of people in receipt of a jobseeker\/PUP payments and the general travel advice issued by Governments around the world, the Department believes that it was entirely reasonable during that short period of time, that an inspector would form the view, in accordance with the provisions of the 2005 Act, that passengers embarking on a flight could include persons who were in receipt of social welfare payments.  It is important to note that the nature of the enquiries was in relation to payments that 825,000 people (33% of all working age adults or more than 50% of all private sector workers) were then receiving.  <\/p><p>In carrying out this work, the Department&rsquo;s overriding focus has been to ensure compliance with the provisions and rules of social welfare schemes. Payments were, therefore, stopped where recipients no longer had an entitlement because they were leaving the State. Over &euro;10m in savings has been generated by this work.  <\/p><p>While there are a number of criminal prosecutions underway in relation to the PUP, no criminal prosecutions have been initiated by the Department directly arising from the checks at the airport.<\/p><p>The last compliance check conducted by the Department in Dublin airport was on 16 July.  The last checks at ports took place on 28 July. This reflects a number of factors including the significant reduction in the numbers receiving the pandemic payment over recent months and the operational experience of the Department in carrying out this work. It also reflects the Department&rsquo;s evolving approach in light of the Government&rsquo;s advice around travel abroad. <\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy should note that the Department&rsquo;s inspectors have been undertaking control checks at airports and ports since 2012. The work being done in recent months was, therefore, part of the ongoing control work that the Department is engaged in and was done in the context of the Covid19 pandemic where people were leaving the State in large numbers, many with open PUP claims.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800093#WRQQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance","counter":2064,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800093#WRQQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2065,"qnumday":758,"qnumall":"[22463\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800093#WRQQ01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the reason a decision has not yet issued on a carer&rsquo;s allowance application by a person (details supplied) received on 18 July 2019 will be investigated; when the application will be finalised; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2066,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment made to a person who is habitually resident in the State and who is providing full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has such a disability that as a result they require that level of care.<\/p><p>I confirm that my department received an application for CA from the person concerned on 8 July 2019.<\/p><p>The application was referred to a local social welfare inspector (SWI) on 22 October 2019 to assess the level of care being provided, assess means and confirm that all the conditions for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance are satisfied.<\/p><p>The SWI spoke to the person concerned by phone on 27 August 2020 and set out the outstanding information required to process his application.

The question under appeal was whether the rate of entitlement to DA had been properly calculated and whether it was correct to raise an overpayment in his case. The Appeal was disallowed<b>. <\/b>The Appeal&rsquo;s Officer&rsquo;s decision is final and may only be reviewed in light of new facts or fresh evidence being submitted that was not to hand at the time of the appeal.<\/p><p>When determining the rate of debt recovery, the Department must ensure it does not cause undue hardship to the person having regard to their circumstances and their overall ability to pay. The debt recovery unit (DRU) in the Department will engage with the person concerned and will take into consideration any financial burden they are experiencing. DRU will consider all circumstances and tailor a new repayment plan that is reasonable both for the person concerned and for  the Department. As with all debts owed to the Department, the Minister must make every effort to recover debts in full and debts will remain until fully recovered.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800093#WRQQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":2070,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800093#WRQQ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2071,"qnumday":760,"qnumall":"[22467\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800093#WRQQ02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if consideration will be given to granting a request by a person (details supplied) to travel to Romania to visit their gravely ill parent without ceasing their pandemic unemployment payment on compassionate grounds.","asker":"1453","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2072,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I have asked my officials to amend the regulations so that people on jobseeker's payments who wish to travel to any of the countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payment.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State Pension (Transition).  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  The legislation provided for increases to the State pension age - to 67 in 2021 and further to 68 in 2028.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to defer the planned increase to State pension age from 66 to 67 in 2021.  I intend to introduce legislation later this year to do that.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on modelling conducted earlier this year, the Department&rsquo;s best current estimate for the additional net costs per annum of not increasing State Pension Age to 67 years in 2021 range from c. &euro;180 million in 2021 (due to a first year effect) to an average of over &euro;400 million per annum thereafter, with this increasing every year.  These estimates are for net costs and take into consideration additional increases or reductions arising in PRSI receipts, movements from other social welfare schemes, and secondary benefit entitlements including Free Travel, Fuel Allowance, Household Benefit Payment and Telephone Allowance.  The estimates are based on current rates of payments and do not make any provision for rate increases.  The cost of these estimates would be expected to double from 2028, should the State Pension Age not increase to 68, as is currently legislated for.<\/p>  <p>  When State Pension (Transition) existed, it was a scheme which allowed those who were retired to get a transitionary payment between the ages of 65 and 66 years.  The maximum personal rate was equivalent to the then maximum rate for the State Pension (Contributory).  Eligibility was based on PRSI contributions and credits, and it was not a means tested payment.  It is important to note that the conditions and eligibility requirements for State Pension (Transition) were different to those for the State Pension (Contributory).  For example, a person had to have a minimum average of 24 contributions per annum to be eligible for the previous model of State Pension (Transition) whereas an average of 10 contributions per annum is required for State Pension (Contributory) eligibility.  In addition, recipients of the previous model of State Pension (Transition) were not eligible for Free Travel, the Household Benefits Package (electricity, gas, TV licence) or Living Alone Allowance. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s best current estimate for the gross cost of reintroducing State Pension (Transition), on the same basis as it previously operated, is &euro;293 million for a full year.  It is expected that these costs would be offset somewhat by savings of &euro;166 million on Working Age Schemes, arising from recipients transferring from these schemes to State Pension (Transition), giving a net cost of &euro;127 million each year.  These figures are based on current payment rates.  This costing was calculated based on analysis of the observed  ratio of SPT awards to State Pension (Contributory) awards for the period from 2009 to 2012, and projecting this forward in terms of estimated recipient numbers in coming years.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the above costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revisions of the estimated numbers of recipients.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to introducing a Retirement Payment for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseeker's Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I have made the introduction of the new Retirement Payment an immediate priority for my Department.  The new payment will be introduced as early as possible for those who are retired from employment.  Officials in the Department are currently considering the design of the scheme and assessing the necessary legislation, ICT system requirements and administrative processes required to support the introduction of this payment.

These regulations stipulate that all staff working directly with children must hold a minimum of a Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education on the National Framework of Qualifications.<\/p><p>The introduction of the minimum Level 5 Major Award requirement had been initially announced in 2013, and my Department provided extensive financial investment to support staff to achieve the relevant qualification in the form of multiple Learner Fund bursary rounds between 2014 and 2016. Great strides were made by the sector and over 96% of staff in 2019 held the necessary qualification. To accommodate staff who were due to retire, the Department made available an option for unqualified staff who were planning to retire over the coming years, to sign a grandfather declaration that enabled them to work without qualification for a 5-year period up to September 2021.<\/p><p>The minimum qualification requirement was introduced to raise the quality of provision for children and improve child outcomes. <i>First 5,<\/i>the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care. The evidence is irrefutable about the importance of the first five years of life for children's learning. Children achieve better outcomes when staff are qualified. This is undisputed internationally.  <i>First 5 <\/i>seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce&rsquo;. In line with <i>First 5<\/i>, my Department is currently leading on a Workforce Development Plan which will set out actions to support professionalisation of the workforce, including achieving a graduate-led workforce and raising the profile of careers in the sector by 2028 (50% of the workforce will have degrees by 2028). <\/p><p>Any decision to extend the grandfathering arrangement or to lower qualification requirements - even temporarily - would run counter to the direction of Government and international policy in this area and would require a strong evidence base. My Department is continuing to monitor workforce developments in the sector and gather data on recruitment difficulties. New data will be available in the coming weeks as part of the annual Pobal Early Years Sector Profile. It is understood that there is a sufficient supply of qualified workers into the sector, the challenge is that they are not being retained, primarily due to poor working terms and conditions. It is the latter that needs to be addressed, and the Workforce Development Plan and other measures will seek to do this.<\/p><p>Additionally, an Advisory Group on the phased reopening of Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare services was established in May 2020 to advise on measures related to COVID. Recruitment and retention of staff is currently being considered by them. The group is chaired by my Department and its membership includes eight representatives of staff and providers.  The Advisory Group plans to consider the evidence regarding recruitment difficulties in the coming weeks, and what measures may be appropriate to best serve the needs of children. I will be happy to update Deputies on this when work has progressed.<\/p><p>Finally, my Department is currently consulting with those working in the sector and asking them to share their views on the steps that should be taken in the Workforce Development Plan. The first round of public consultation was due to commence in March 2020 but was postponed due to the outbreak of Covid-19. An online survey opened in August, and closes on 2 October.

In creating a single national scheme, the aim is to operate within a user-friendly system that can respond to both the parent\/carer&rsquo;s unique circumstances and to also reflect the needs of providers. <\/p>  <p>  The flexibility of the NCS means that the average time for processing applications may not be the best indication of the application experience because the NCS is designed to recognise that childcare needs are different for each family. The financial circumstances of families may also change throughout the year which can require manual intervention. Depending on the application choices and family circumstances their process flow through the system could be different. <\/p>  <p>  There are two types of application: <\/p>  <p>  Universal Application for Universal Subsidies that are available to all families with children under 3 years old. They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 40 hours per week (45 hours per week after 7th September 2020).<\/p>  <p>  Income Assessed Application for Income Assessed Subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. The rate a family receives will vary depending on their level of family income, child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in the family.<\/p>  <p>  Parents\/carers apply directly to the Scheme for financial support. The NCS offers a flexible application process, with a variety of assessment options for parents. The quickest way for a Parent to have their income assessed is to use the 'Fast Track' option online. Fast Track assessment will gather information from Revenue and DEASP for the most recent year that full income information is available. In general this is either last year or the year before. This requires a verified MyGovID account and families can apply directly at www.ncs.gov.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The innovative, purpose-built IT system of the NCS aims to process a universal application in a matter of minutes, and an income assessed application in a matter of days. <\/p>  <p>  A parent can choose not to Fast Track their assessment if their income has decreased significantly from the previous tax year or if they want to opt out of an automatic assessment. This will require the parent to upload documents to support the application. The NCS advises parents choosing this option the assessment will take longer to process than Fast Track assessments. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme offers a flexible application process sensitive to changes that may happen in families,  for example if a parent has lost income due to COVID-19 they can apply for a Current Year Assessment. This allows parents to have their current year&rsquo;s income assessed to determine their level of subsidy, rather than the default option of the previous tax year. This could more accurately reflect their current income level. In addition to this there is also the &lsquo;Sudden Change Assessment&rsquo; option which allows for applicants to declare that they have had an ongoing change to their income. This applies to people who have lost a job or their income has reduced on an ongoing basis for reasons outside of their control. Parents will need to complete a new NCS application to avail of this measure and will unavoidably need to submit documentation as there is no way to automatically process these types of applications.<\/p>  <p>  Parents who do not wish or are unable to submit an online application for the NCS may submit a paper application instead. Parents can apply offline by requesting a postal application form by contacting the NCS Parent Support Centre on 01-9068530.  <\/p>  <p>  The longest time to process an application for a CHICK awarded in August was 109 days. This inordinate amount of time was spent awaiting documents to be submitted by the applicant. The system allows for a partially completed application to remain active for some time.<\/p>  <p>  The average processing time for an income assessed application in August was 11 Days, 49% of applications were processed in 7 days (excluding universal applications which are all almost instanteous). <\/p>  <p>  Following this application process the parents will bring this CHICK to their childcare provider in order for their child to be registered for the NCS. NCS subsidies can only be paid once a CHICK has been registered by a childcare provider, and the parent has confirmed on the NCS system that all details are correct. <\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to say whether the parent was in a childcare provider or paying fees whilst the application was being processed or whether the child started with provider after the CHICK was received. This is a local matter between the provider and parent until the provider and parent agree to register the CHICK.<\/p>  <p>  Pobal as scheme administrator, under the oversight of the Department, will continue to monitor the service delivery times and take appropriate measures to speed up processing times and bring efficiencies to bear on what is still a relatively new scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800096#WRVV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800096#WRVV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2213,"qnumday":815,"qnumall":"[21746\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800096#WRVV01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on cr&egrave;ches inserting a clause in their terms and conditions stating that full fees are applicable for all closures due to exceptional circumstances beyond their control in view of the Covid-19 pandemic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2214,"content":"<p>Early learning and care and school age childcare services are provided by private enterprises. 75% of services are operated as private businesses and 25% are operated on a not-for-profit basis by community and voluntary organisations.  <\/p><p>All services who are registered with Tulsa may enter into funding agreements with my Department to deliver childcare subsidy schemes, including the NCS, CCSP and TEC, and ECCE, the free universal pre-school programme.  <\/p><p>Providers are free to set their own policies regarding parental fees for childcare services.<\/p><p>If an individual service is directed to close by public health authorities due to a confirmed case of Covid-19 in that service, the service may apply for continuation of funding under the Department subsidy schemes, in accordance with the force majeure conditions of the schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800096#WRVV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":2215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800096#WRVV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2216,"qnumday":816,"qnumall":"[21781\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800096#WRVV01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if guidance or advice has issued to childcare providers in respect of after-school services for childminding in cases in which the childcare provider collects children from schools and looks after them until they are collected by parents or guardians after work.","asker":"1552","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2217,"content":"<p>Expert guidance on the safe reopening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic was published by the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on 29 May, and updated on 31 July.

The recommendations outlined in the submission along with other relevant submissions received in advance of budget 2021 are being considered as part of the overall budgetary discussions on higher education provision for 2021. <\/p>  <p>  To date significant progress has been made in increasing investment in Higher Education and putting in place a sustainable funding model for Higher Education.  We currently invest &euro;1.87 billion, before the Covid response funding, in our third level sector.  Following the announcements in Budget 2020 Higher Education spending has increased in the order of &euro;450 million compared to 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I am focused on mitigating against the impacts of COVID 19 on vulnerable students. Covid-19 has disrupted many aspects of our lives. For students in third level, it has resulted in a changed college experience.   The resumption of the academic year is our most pressing challenge and ensuring our students and staff are safe is my number one priority. <\/p>  <p>  A substantial funding package of &euro;168m was announced on 22 July for publically funded further and higher education providers under the remit of my Department and for students to mitigate against the impacts of Covid.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the package of Covid supports for the higher and further education sector I have allocated &euro;15 million of capital funding for a once-off Covid 19 Grant to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices.  This grant is being made available to further and higher education institutions.  The institutions are using the grant funding to purchase devices to support disadvantaged students who are encountering challenges in accessing devices for online and blended learning.  The distribution of the devices, and the associated terms and conditions, will be a matter for each individual further or higher education provider. <\/p>  <p>  The package of Covid 19 supports also includes a further &euro;10m in access supports for students. Most of this money will be used to top up the Student Assistance Fund, with remaining funding used to support students via the access services in the higher education institutions. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of additional financial support will assist the safe commencement of the 2020\/21 academic year and in order that the sector can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs and provide assurance and confidence to students and their families as well as to staff and other key stakeholder regarding the capacity and capability of the sector in meeting critical teaching and learning and research objectives.<\/p>  <p>  The future funding needs of the sector are currently under further review through the Departments engagement with the European Commission\/DG Reform. The review is a comprehensive economic evaluation of the various funding options presented in the Cassells Expert Group Report and is being undertaken by an expert independent international consortium of consultants including Indecon and LE Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Since taking up office in this Department and through the ongoing budgetary process, I am engaging closely and considering proposals from a wide range of stakeholders including USI.  I will continue to work towards increased investment in Higher Education and supports for students for 2021 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800098#WRXX01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further Education and Training Programmes","counter":2325,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800098#WRXX01300"},{"type":"question","counter":2326,"qnumday":854,"qnumall":"[21739\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800098#WRXX01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of the 35,000 further and higher education places announced in the July stimulus package; the estimated cost of each place; the breakdown of the number of places between further and higher education; when the first additional new place will be available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2327,"content":"<p>The package of funding for higher and further education and training announced as part of the July stimulus amounts to &euro;100 million and will fund over 35,000 places to start in the current year.

Reflecting the needs of those displaced by the pandemic, it is built around delivering foundation skills for modern workplaces, a strong digital skills component and the specific vocational skills needed to compete for opportunities in growth areas.  The framework will deliver full time courses but also substantial part time, online and blended learning elements. Skills to Compete will provide for 12,000 part time and 7,000 full time courses at a cost of &euro;37 million.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Skillnet Ireland, an employer-led training body predominantly serving SMEs, are also well-positioned to contribute to the response. &euro;3 million has been provided to deliver a total of 3,550 places on Skillnet Ireland activation programmes and to support SMEs to adapt and innovate in response to the crisis.  This includes supports for training the owners and managers who are critical to securing the futures of these companies. <\/p>  <p>  -  A &euro;3,000 recruitment payment has been provided though the July Stimulus to any approved apprenticeship employer who takes on an apprentice between now and the end of the year.  The employer will receive &euro;2,000 on registration and a further &euro;1,000 in 2021 to support retention.  The incentive was costed to bring registrations back to the forecast level for 2020, which required &euro;12 million in 2020 in respect of 6,000 places.<\/p>  <p>  The Higher Education sector was awarded &euro;47.5m in the stimulus package enabling an increase of 7,150 places as follows: <\/p>  <p>  -  The Stimulus package provided that a further additional 2,000 places are created in Springboard+ and HCI Pillar 1 programmes at a cost of &euro;10 million.<\/p>  <p>  -  In addition to the expansion of these existing programmes the July Stimulus provided for two additional new programmes. Recognising the changing and increasing proportion of the workforce that are already graduates, and ensuring that the stimulus package provides opportunities as widely as possible, a new programme to create an additional 2,650 places across existing part-time and full-time postgraduate taught programmes is provided for at a cost of &euro;22.5m in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  -  Funding of &euro;15m has also been provided for an innovative new programme referred to as Modular Skills Provision.  This programme will create up to 2,500 full time equivalant places on shorter, more focused courses offered in a flexible manner and through blended or online learning allowing students to gain important skills without taking a considerable period away from the labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800098#WRXX01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":2328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800098#WRXX01600"},{"type":"question","counter":2329,"qnumday":855,"qnumall":"[21740\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800098#WRXX01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the role his Department will play in terms of direct research funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2330,"content":"<p>The overarching vision in <i>Innovation 2020<\/i>, the current national strategy for research and development, science and technology, is for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader driving a strong sustainable economy and a better society.

I am of course aware of the contribution made by the sector and of the challenges that are being encountered given the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on students, teachers and providers.<\/p><p>As part of the response to the pandemic, my Department established a specific Working Group for this sector. This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and representatives of both students and English language education providers.  <\/p><p>As part of this process, the representative bodies for English language education providers have engaged with the Working Group surrounding their proposals for supports to aid the recovery of this sector.  In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government, as part of the wider Covid-19 response, to support businesses at this time. These measures included the temporary wages subsidy scheme (TWSS) to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. When announced, this temporary scheme was expected to be in place for a 12 week period. However, recognising the circumstances surrounding the re-opening of the economy as well as the need to avoid the risk of forcing otherwise viable firms to close, the Government agreed that the TWSS would remain in place until the end of August. Following the conclusion of the TWSS, it has been superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which will continue to provide payroll support to businesses until 31 March 2021. The EWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable for the Exchequer. In addition to the subsidy that is being provided via the EWSS, this scheme also provides for a reduction in Employers PRSI.<\/p><p>Further to the above, the ELE provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices.

Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities in Ireland. Furthermore, it provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD. The NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group recently carried out a mid-term review of the Strategy which examined how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. Arising from the mid-term review, a commitment was made that the Department of Justice and Equality will develop a UNCRPD implementation plan that will include monitoring structures and metrics as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. <\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in April 2017 and many of its recommendations have been implemented. In addition, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 includes positive action measures to support the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service and in the wider economy. Significant expenditure is being committed by individual departments to responding to the needs of persons with disabilities.  For example,  &euro;1.7bn was spent by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on Disability Allowance payments in 2019. &euro;2.054bn has been allocated in the HSE Service Plan for disability-related expenditure this year.  Funding for special education provision in 2020 will amount to &euro;1.9bn which is equivalent to 20% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined, the Deputy will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In order to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s laws on liberty and security of the person as they relate to persons with a disability and to ensure that Ireland fully complies with Article 14, the Government has been working towards enacting specific legislation. The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, each have an important role in this regard. In addition, a stand-alone Bill on Deprivation of Liberty is being progressed. The Bill will provide procedural safeguards to ensure that people are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in relevant facilities. <\/p>  <p>  An approach has been developed to provide for situations in which an individual lacks the capacity to consent to their care arrangements (which amount to a deprivation of liberty) and will provide a legal basis for these care arrangements to be authorised by a body to be established within the health service.  The authorisation will not cover any other decision to be made in relation to that individual e.g. financial decisions or consent to medical treatment. Work to refine the draft legislative proposals is ongoing and complicated policy issues that have arisen are being resolved, in consultation with an Advisory Group and relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published in December 2016. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process. <\/p>  <p>  Published in December 2016, the Bill&rsquo;s stated purpose was to address remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  The opportunity was also taken to progress other miscellaneous amendments to statute law. The Bill amends:<\/p>  <p>  -  the Juries Act to accommodate (i) deaf persons who need the services of a sign language interpreter and (ii) persons with mental illness being subject to a functional capacity test<\/p>  <p>  -  the Electoral Act to repeal the prohibition on a person of unsound mind from standing for election to the national and European parliament-  the National Disability Act to (i) change the status of NDA staff from public to civil servants, in line with all other bodies in the Justice Vote and (ii) to provide information and advice including statistics to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) -  the Equal Status Act to elaborate the principle of refusal of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; on grounds of cost-  the Disability Act to bring civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of Part V of that Act which contains measures applicable to the public service including employee quotas-  the IHREC Act to create a statutory basis for IHREC to (i) keep under review the law and practice relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, and (ii) to that end appoint an advisory committee, and (iii) apply to the Court of Appeal to appear as amicus curiae (friend of the court).<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was at Committee Stage when it lapsed with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in January 2020. A decision is now required as to whether the lapsed Bill should be revisited, or if a new Bill should be drafted. <\/p>  <p>  The monitoring framework for implementation of the Convention will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  The Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is an international treaty that establishes two procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the Convention. The first is an individual communications procedure allowing individuals to bring petitions to the Committee claiming breaches of their rights; the second is an inquiry procedure giving the Committee authority to undertake inquiries of grave or systematic violations of the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government reiterates the commitment to ratify the Optional Protocol after the first reporting cycle. <\/p>  <p>   It is not possible to arrive at a precise budgetary figure in relation to the monitoring or implementation of the Convention including the Optional Protocol. Individual actions across different departments have associated cost implications that are included in the votes of the relevant departments.<\/p>  <p>  As this is a function that is due to transfer, it will of course be a matter for my colleague, Mr. Roderic O'Gorman, T.D., the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, to bring these matters forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800099#WRYY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":2401,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800099#WRYY03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2402,"qnumday":880,"qnumall":"[21234\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800099#WRYY03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she has taken to resolve the issues which gave rise to hunger strikes at a direct provision centre (details supplied).","asker":"1553","askee":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":2403,"qnumday":950,"qnumall":"[22112\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800099#WRYY03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans for a direct provision centre (details supplied) following the transfer of the final resident later in 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2404,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 880 and 950 together.<\/p><p>On 18 March 2020, in response to the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department entered into a 12 month contract to use the former Skellig Star Hotel in Cahersiveen as a temporary accommodation centre for international protection applicants.<\/p><p>On 30 July 2020, I announced that the residents would be transferred to permanent accommodation centres, in line with my Department's policy to withdraw from emergency accommodation as quickly as possible, and that this process would be completed as soon as possible and by no later than the end of the year. <\/p><p>The final transfer from the Skellig Star was completed last week and there are no remaining residents onsite.

The 2015 Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced. The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). <\/p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and enable the recruitment of the Director of the DSS.

The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing.   The DSS, led by its Director, is working on putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed. This will enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be necessary through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021.

The Act is a practical tool that provides modern framework for applying standards in the area of animal welfare.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to strengthen the Act and to enforce its provisions.  The Act aims at a balance between the rights of an individual and the role of the State services to act for the public policy objective of ensuring the optimum level of animal  welfare.<\/p>  <p>  My Department keeps the Act under review given developments in the area of animal welfare and the law and having regard to the practical lessons learnt from operating the Act.  Indeed, my Department is currently working on proposals to amend the Act to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government for the ordered end to fur farming.  This opportunity will also be used to bring forward any desired adjustments to the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Neglect of or causing unnecessary suffering to animals is not acceptable in our society.

My Department works closely with these bodies and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all involved for their work in the field of animal welfare.<\/p>  <p>  My Department dedicates a substantial level of resources and funding to animal welfare. This follows fro last year when  the largest ever allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m was made to 106 animal welfare bodies, a number of which undertake work with urban horses.

It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between two and seven days will be imposed by the court, together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second or subsequent offence is a closure order of between seven and 30 days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licence holder is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the sale of psychoactive substances online, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through the Garda National Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), interacts with the HSE and other relevant stakeholders, including the HPRA, where it observes particular trends in drug use that may require intervention on the part of the Department of Health or other relevant Department and\/or State agency.  In this regard, the GNDOCB is communicating with relevant state bodies relating to the possession and use by particular persons of psychoactive substances.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the circumstances of particular cases that come within the terms of the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, enforcement and prevention strategies are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800100#WRZZ05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2485,"content":"<p>Question No. 907 answered with Question No. 886.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Promotions","counter":2486,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800100#WRZZ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2487,"qnumday":908,"qnumall":"[21514\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800100#WRZZ05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 297 of 16 October 2018, if issues raised in correspondence (details supplied) will be addressed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2488,"content":"<p>Parliamentary Question 297 of 16 October 2018 refers to candidates that failed to progress in the previous two Garda to Sergeant competitions, who sought to have the decision reviewed or appealed; and the number of these decisions overturned on review. <\/p><p>I can confirm that a substantive response to Parliamentary Question 297 of 16 October 2018 was issued on 21 December 2018.

Category F1 is the least hazardous category and covers party poppers and sparklers, while Category F4 represents the most hazardous. <\/p>  <p>  In the interests of safety and security, it is Government policy to restrict the availability of the more hazardous fireworks to the general public - including categories F2, F3 and F4. A licence is required to import fireworks in any of these categories. Licences under the Explosives Act are issued by my Department only for the importation of fireworks which are to be used in organised displays conducted by professional and competent operators.  <\/p>  <p>  Every year, as we approach Halloween, my Department runs an awareness campaign aimed at ensuring the public knows about the legislation governing the importation and use of fireworks. We highlight the fact that the importation and use of fireworks without a licence is illegal and inform the public of the severe penalties that can attach to firework related offences.<\/p>  <p>  An example of the penalties faced include a fine of up to &euro;10,000 and up to five years imprisonment if convicted of having fireworks in your possession with intent to sell or supply. Igniting fireworks or throwing an ignited firework at a person or property is also liable to the same severe penalty. These penalties illustrate how seriously such offences are taken.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this awareness raising work undertaken by my Department in the run up to Halloween, additional efforts are made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at this time of year to combat the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks, known as Operation Tombola. The Garda Commissioner informs me that under Operation Tombola each District prepares an Operational Plan to tackle the sale of fireworks including through:<\/p>  <p>  - Combating the importation, sale and distribution of illegal fireworks, through intelligence led operations, visits to local car boot sales, searches and seizures of fireworks.<\/p>  <p>  -  Liaising with local authorities and Fire Services regarding the provision of official, supervised bonfire sites, the policing of these, and the identification and removal of stockpiled bonfire material and abandoned vehicles from other locations. <\/p>  <p>  -  Promoting awareness of the danger associated with the improper use of fireworks and unsupervised bonfires through the use of the media, social media, school visits and information leaflet distribution by members and the Crime Prevention Officer.<\/p>  <p>  -  High visibility policing of the Halloween night celebrations, i.e. beat, bike and mobile patrols, thus preventing damage to property, injury, trauma for the vulnerable and the elderly, and general loutish behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  -  Utilising the Divisional Public Order Unit on Halloween Night.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Tombola also focuses on preventing associated public disorder and anti-social behaviour through the incremental deployment of resources, including Garda Public Order Units to augment local plans as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that on the evening of 4 September 2020, as part of ongoing operations, Garda&iacute; from the Mallow District Drugs Unit, assisted by Garda&iacute; from Mallow and the Southern Region Dog Unit executed two search warrants at houses in Mallow town.

The Commission recommended that the Garda Commissioner evaluate the then existing reform programme - the Modernisation and Renewal Programme (MRP) - through the lens of the Report and halt any initiatives that did not fit with its vision. <\/p><p>In December 2018, Government published <i>A Policing Service for our Future (APSFF) <\/i>&ndash; the 4-year Plan (2019-2022) to implement the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI).

They include:<\/p><p>1. Provision of further new or refurbished courthouses in provincial cities and county towns where facilities remain sub-standard (including Galway city, Wicklow town, Portlaoise, Tralee and Roscommon) and further provincial locations such as An Cloch&aacute;n Liath (Dungloe) to serve as the Gaeltacht Court for the region, and Tuam.<\/p><p>2. Family Law Court complex at Hammond Lane.<\/p><p>3. Redevelopment and modernisation of the Four Courts following completion of the Hammond Lane project as a campus for Civil courts.<\/p><p>4. Construction of standard county town type court facilities at a number of locations in county Dublin (outside of the city centre) and also in North Kildare, Bray and Navan.<\/p><p>5. Regional Family Law centres.<\/p><p>The precise allocation and timing of additional funding over the entire ten year period of the plan remains to be fully determined. It will be dependent on the outcome of further detailed planning and analysis of costs which will determine prioritisation of projects from a timing and budgetary perspective. <\/p><p>Specifically in relation to Wicklow, a courthouse comprising four courtrooms and related facilities (e.g. consultation rooms, custody facilities, facilities for juries and vulnerable witnesses, legal practitioner&rsquo;s suites etc) is envisaged as being required to meet current and future demand in Wicklow. This will require a building significantly larger than the existing two courtroom building. The Courts Service proposes to refurbish and extend the courthouse to provide the required accommodation. As a prerequisite first step, the Courts Service has acquired a number of adjoining properties that were in council ownership so as to have available a larger site capable of accommodating a courthouse building on the scale envisaged. <\/p><p>Facilitating works envisaged for the refurbishment and extension of Wicklow courthouse include the demolition of the 1940s extension\/annex to the rear of the courthouse. In view of the fact that dry rot has spread extensively throughout the extension, the Courts Service proposes to bring this element of the facilitating works forward rather than incur the cost of treating the dry rot only to demolish the extension at a later date as part of the overall development. It will be necessary to go through the Part IX planning process in advance of this work. The Courts Service has been in contact with the State Architect about these works and it is intended that they will proceed subject to funding being available and OPW resource availability in light of commitments in other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800102#WRBBB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":2594,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800102#WRBBB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":2595,"qnumday":948,"qnumall":"[22105\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800102#WRBBB05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the necessary changes will be put in place in order to reduce the waiting time for appointments at Anglesea Street Garda Station, Cork in respect of the renewal of visas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2596,"content":"<p>Measures to safely re-open the Registration Office at Anglesea Street Garda station in Cork city have been put in place by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>Registrations at the Anglesea Street Garda station are now by way of appointment only.

I understand the application relating to this case was received in June 2017.  With regard to the particular application in question, I am informed by the Tribunal secretariat that a decision of first instance has been made by the Tribunal on the application. The applicant was notified of the decision in June and afforded the opportunity to accept or appeal it.  I am informed that the applicant recently appealed the decision. The appeal hearing will involve three Tribunal Members, of which the Member who made the initial decision will not be one, who will consider the application on a de novo basis, and the applicant will be invited to participate in the appeal hearing.   <\/p>  <p>  In providing support for victims of crime, I fully agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s view that it would be desirable if all cases could be progressed to a conclusion quickly. However delays arise for a variety of reasons. This may, for example, be due to the need for expert medical or other reports or due to delays in receipt of the final Garda reports on the crime. There may also be delays due to the need to await the outcomes of any court cases related to the incident, as applied in relation to the application in question. It is also the case that delays can arise where supporting documentation or additional information has been sought by the Tribunal and applicants take time to provide it. I understand that a number of delays arose in respect of this application, related to such matters.   <\/p>  <p>  Overall I can, however, assure the Deputy that applications made under the Scheme are processed by the Tribunal. 290 applications have been sent to Tribunal Members for decision since the start of the year. Appeal hearings by the Tribunal have been affected by the pandemic. There has been disruption to the appeal hearing schedule this year, with scheduled appeal hearings in March having to be postponed. But I am informed that since April, appeal hearings by teleconference are being offered to applicants, as physical hearings are not currently possible due to social distancing requirements. These have been taking place where applicants accept them.  I understand that an appeal hearing by teleconference will be offered to the applicant in the case in question as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800103#WRCCC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service","counter":2618,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800103#WRCCC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2619,"qnumday":957,"qnumall":"[22389\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800103#WRCCC02000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the delays in the processing of visa applications by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service which has resulted in the withholding of the passports of applicants by the service for prolonged periods of time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1466","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2620,"content":"<p>The Registration Office of the Immigration Services Delivery (ISD) Division of my Department is currently processing approximately 15,000 applications (accompanied by passports) that have been sent in by people seeking to renew their immigration registration. <\/p>  <p>  Significant demand accumulated during the four months that the Registration Office was closed due to Covid-19.

GYDPs seek to divert young people who have become involved, or are at risk of becoming involved, in crime\/anti-social behaviour away from future involvement with the Criminal Justice System. They are primarily targeted at 12-17 year old young people in communities where a specific need for the service has been identified. On average the Garda Youth Diversion Projects engage with between 3,500 and 4,000 young people across the state in any one year. <\/p><p>While the projects primarily receive referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they may receive referrals from other sources including schools, parents or self-referrals, including in some cases working with young people who are not under Garda supervision, or have been deemed unsuitable for diversion. Individual GYDPs also undertake early intervention preventative work and support for families. Therefore, as projects include a mixture of young people referred from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other sources, data on GYDPs participants is not directly comparable with data on those considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme.<\/p><p>The specific information breakdown requested, linking participation in GYDPs and referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (and based on CHO areas) is not available. However, I have asked the Garda authorities to provide information on cases considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme, and I will communicate further with the Deputy as soon as more details are available. <\/p><p>I have attached the location of each Garda Youth Diversion Project, based on Garda Districts, to be of assistance. <\/p><p>\">Youth Diversion Programmes<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800103#WRCCC04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting","counter":2646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800103#WRCCC04800"},{"type":"question","counter":2647,"qnumday":968,"qnumall":"[22687\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800103#WRCCC04900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when an application for Garda vetting submitted by a school teacher (details supplied) in County Galway will be processed in view of the urgent need for the processing of a Garda clearance in this case given the current front-line role teachers are playing in the re-opening of schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2648,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that vetting applications are an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and neither I nor my Department have any role in the processing of individual vetting applications.<\/p><p>I would emphasise to the Deputy that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults.

It is essential that clinical placements can now re-commence for all healthcare students in line with the requirements of their courses and to ensure the continuation of a sustainable workforce into the future. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to advise the Deputy that guidance on the resumption of clinical placements  was recently issued by the Chief Clinical Officer of the HSE to all Higher Education Institutes and copied to healthcare providers. This guidance included a revised version ( dated 17 August, 2020) of the HSE's document - Infection Prevention and Control Requirements for Clinical Placements in HSE facilities in the context of COVID-19. This document, among other things, sets out the requirement for Infection Prevention and Control Training for all students. It also underlines that clinical placements are an essential part of students' education and training, ensuring that they will continue to receive the breath of clinical experience that they require. <\/p>  <p>  According to this guidance, students can move from a placement in one setting to a placement in another without an interval of time, provided they complete a COVID-19 Healthcare Worker Relocation Self Risk Assessment prior to commencing in a different location. Similarly, if a student continues part-time work in a healthcare setting during the same period as attending clinical placements, they are required to complete this self-assessment on an ongoing basis so that any need for testing may be identified. The guidance makes it clear that students should not present on clinical placement if they have any symptoms of acute infection. Overall, the guidance facilitates students in completing their education and training and in doing so it does not preclude them from working part time so long as they adhere to the infection prevention and control requirements. In terms of financial supports there is a travel\/accommodation allowance which amounts to &euro;50.79 a week to support those students to access the clinical placements they require.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding testing , NPHET is giving ongoing consideration to the testing policy for healthcare workers. There is a range of what are termed rapid tests available in the market with different test types and sensitivity. The HSE established a laboratory taskforce (including key clinical leaders) within the Test and Trace team who make decisions on testing platforms to deploy, primarily guided by NPHET. NPHET has recently asked HIQA to review recent evidence on point of care testing. This review will inform future decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800104#WRDDD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":2680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800104#WRDDD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2681,"qnumday":977,"qnumall":"[22161\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800104#WRDDD02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if consideration will be given to the development of a national respite support scheme for children under six years of age living with a serious disability; and if not, if support will be provided to a foundation (details supplied) in order that it can expand its pilot programme.","asker":"1481","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2682,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.<\/p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800104#WRDDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2683,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800104#WRDDD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2684,"qnumday":978,"qnumall":"[22162\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800104#WRDDD02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the matter of allowing hotels to operate wedding functions later than 11:30 p.m. will be investigated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2685,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday 18 August, 2020 the Government decided to implement a number of enhanced public health measures in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19.<\/p><p>These measures were introduced in response to an increase in the number of cases in recent weeks, with multiple outbreaks across workplaces, households, and in sports clubs.

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects.<\/p><p>The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) lead in the coordination of efforts by national agencies to manage medicine shortages. The Authority has developed a now well-established, multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework and coordinates all stakeholders to share information in order to prevent or mitigate the impact of medicine shortages when they occur.<\/p><p>Over the last two years, the HPRA received, on average, 66 notifications per month of potential or actual medicines shortages. In many of these cases, an impact on patients was avoided or if the shortage could not be avoided its impact or duration was reduced. This Framework was successful in ultimately preventing potential shortages in 20% of cases. Of the remaining shortages notified to the HPRA, 78% of the shortages were resolved, with 60% of those resolved earlier than initially anticipated or as expected due to the coordinated strategies of the stakeholders.  <\/p><p>The HPRA also hosts a list of medicines currently in short supply on its website () with expected dates for return of supply. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and lessening the impact that they have on their patients. <\/p><p>In the case of medicines used most often in Ireland, there are typically multiple forms, brands, and generic medicines available from a range of sources. In the event that there are some supply issues for individual medicines, it is expected that alternative options such as alternative brands and generic medicines will be available to ensure continuity of treatment. <\/p><p>As a result of the increasing prevalence of medicines shortages globally, there has been significant interest at European level in this area, including a task force on medicines availability to identify and address issues linked to the disruption of supplies of medicines. Ireland, through the Department of Health and the HPRA, continues to contribute to these efforts at a European level to consider initiatives to minimise the risk and disruption to patient safety and care, and the impact on healthcare professionals, caused by medicine shortages. <\/p><p>In addition, the European Commission is currently developing a new Pharmaceutical Strategy, and the recently published roadmap for this strategy places a significant emphasis on actions to address medicines shortages and ensure access to medicines across the EU.<\/p><p>Any patient who is affected by a shortage of a medicine is encouraged to speak with their pharmacist or doctor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800105#WREEE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2744,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800105#WREEE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2745,"qnumday":999,"qnumall":"[21124\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800105#WREEE03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of times the Covid-19 tracker app has been used to alert persons that they are a close contact of a confirmed case of Covid-19; the number of additional cases detected as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2746,"content":"<p>Since the launch of the COVID Tracker App, over 300 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 have uploaded the random IDs that have been generated by their phone, in order to anonymously alert other app users they were in close contact with.

The very significant additional financial resources provided to disability services over the last year, together with the achievement of relatively modest efficiency savings, form part of the financing of the increased service levels set out in the National Service Plan 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  It was intended that these efficiencies would be achieved in 2020 through the application of a 1% efficiency target to existing budgets across all service areas.  However, it has been acknowledged that the achievement of the savings will be challenging in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic and the need for the HSE to focus resources on implementing the health actions in the National Action Plan for COVID-19. Accordingly, the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability and I are of the view that the 1% efficiency target should not be applied to the budgets of disability service providers this year and I have written to the HSE to ask it to relieve Section 38 and Section 39 Disability Service Providers of the obligation to achieve this target.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that a number of Section 38 and Section 39 Disability organisations have reported they are facing financial challenges and have incurred deficits. I understand that the reported deficits are cumulative and historical, having arisen over a number of years, and generally resulted from organisations incurring expenditure in excess of agreed levels set out in their annual Service Level Arrangements.  Organisations funded by the HSE are expected to operate within budget and any deficits accruing through such activities are the responsibility of these organisations themselves, as both Section 38 and Section 39 bodies have independent Boards, who govern the organisations concerned.        <\/p>  <p>  As the financial and performance oversight of Section 38 and Section 39 organisations is a service matter for the HSE, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on the matters raised, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800105#WREEE05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2770,"qnumday":1007,"qnumall":"[21134\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800105#WREEE05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of recruiting and retaining one speech and language therapist;

together.<\/p><p>Cancer diagnostic services (including Rapid Access Clinics) have continued throughout the Covid pandemic, with appropriate restrictions for physical distancing and infection prevention and control (IPC). At this point, attendance numbers at urgent Symptomatic Breast Disease Clinics have returned to pre-Covid levels. While attendances are down for Rapid Access Lung Clinics, Rapid Access Prostate Clinics and non-urgent Breast Disease Clinics, they are showing a steady recovery. Monthly attendance figures, and time to treatment are being used to measure performance and recovery in Rapid Access Clinics. Related to this, and in the context of a reticence among people to visit GPs in the earlier phase of Covid-19, GP e-referrals are being monitored to determine the number of people with suspected cancers coming forward, and, as indicated, such referrals have increased.<\/p><p>Maintaining urgent cancer surgeries has been a priority for the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) throughout the Covid period. Clinical Guidance documents were developed by the NCCP, in conjunction with the relevant Surgical Oncology Clinical Leads Group.  In many hospitals, the focus was on moving time sensitive and complex surgeries to private hospitals that had the required facilities and support services.  Activity levels in surgical oncology are monitored on an on-going basis using HIPE data.<\/p><p>Radiation Oncology services continue to treat all newly referred patients.  Given the extent of the equipment involved, and the purpose-built facilities for radiation oncology, services have remained, largely, within public hospitals. The focus is on ensuring that the maximum number of patients can be treated within the KPI timescales for radiation oncology.  However, the ongoing need for social distancing and other IPC measures will result in capacity being reduced somewhat from pre-Covid levels in the coming months. <\/p><p>The majority of patients presenting for medical oncology services continued to be treated during the Covid period.  However, throughput was reduced, partly because of less patients being referred.  The challenges of social distancing and IPC measures will continue to impact and minor capital works are being considered, where feasible, as part of the means of addressing this.  Monitoring of activity levels in medical oncology continues using HIPE data <\/p><p>The Together 4 Cancer Concern initiative which was commenced in the context of Covid-19 involves community &amp;amp; telephone pyscho-social support for cancer patients, survivors and their families and carers. This is being done as a collaboration involving the NCCP, the Irish Cancer Society, Cancer Care West and the network of community cancer support centres across the country. It includes general and specialist psychological support delivered mainly though telephone and online platforms, with further supports being made available where required.<\/p><p>The possibility of further resourcing of cancer services to address the impacts of Covid-19 are being considered in the contest of the Winter\/Continuity of Services Initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800107#WRGGG05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":2895,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800108#WRHHH00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2896,"qnumday":1054,"qnumall":"[21297\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800108#WRHHH00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding treatment for haemochromatosis patients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2897,"content":"<p>As the HSE has responsibility for the provision, along with the maintenance and operation of Primary Care Centres and other Primary Care facilities, the Executive has been asked to reply directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800108#WRHHH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2899,"qnumday":1055,"qnumall":"[21303\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800108#WRHHH01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathways will be made available to screening services upon resumption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2900,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800108#WRHHH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":2902,"qnumday":1056,"qnumall":"[21304\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800108#WRHHH01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if diagnostic, radiology and laboratory departments are allowed timely access to allow investigations for both hospital doctors and general practitioners in the community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2903,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is now capacity in place to test 15,000 people a day (100,000 tests a week) across our hospital and community system.

It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800110#WRKKK02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3024,"content":"<p>Question No. 1097 answered with Question No. 976.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":3025,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800110#WRKKK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":3026,"qnumday":1098,"qnumall":"[21366\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800110#WRKKK02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an exemption pass will be issued to those that are unable to wear a face covering on public transport and in shops due to a medical condition such as emphysema.","asker":"1491","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3027,"content":"<p>I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department appreciates the challenges experienced by those with medical difficulties.  <\/p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19, including that relating to face coverings, is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).

Healthy Ireland recognises the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to addressing the social determinants of health, as well as an inclusive, intersectoral approach to improve population health and well-being by shifting emphasis to prevention, and empowering individuals and communities to take more responsibility for their health and well-being.<\/p>  <p>  At its core the framework has four goals:<\/p>  <p>1.  to increase the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life<\/p>  <p>2.  to reduce health inequalities<\/p>  <p>3.  to protect the public from threats to health and well-being<\/p>  <p>4.  to create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland<\/p>  <p>  The Framework is therefore implemented via a variety of different means and settings and through a number of different workstreams.  Any additional investment into the framework could be allocated against any of these goals based upon the potential impact on achieving the goals of the Framework.  Given the far-reaching nature of the framework, the multitude of the partnerships and diverse workstreams it is challenging to estimate what additional capacity and services would be delivered for every additional &euro;1mil. <\/p>  <p>  The Healthy Ireland Framework aims to prevent chronic disease, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.  Not only do these non-communicable diseases account for a significant proportion of the expenditure of my Department, but a healthy population is essential to allow people to live their lives to their full potential, to create the right environment to sustain jobs, to aid the economy and to look after the most vulnerable people in society. A healthy population is a major asset for society.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst much of the work of the Healthy Ireland Framework is done in partnership with a multitude of stakeholders, the direct spend of my Department on the Framework in 2019 was &euro;7,4mil.  This expenditure was used to support the Healthy Ireland Fund (&euro;5mil), communications and citizen engagement (&euro;1mil), Healthy Ireland Survey (&euro;1.1mil) and other activities including key research such as the Health Behaviours in School-aged Children study.  <\/p>  <p>  As an example, an additional investment of &euro;1mil into the Healthy Ireland fund would enable the provision of an additional &euro;32,000 to 31 Local Community Development Committees across Ireland to run community based actions that promote Health and Wellbeing through six priority themes including: physical activity, mental health, Nutrition, Sexual Health, Tobacco and Alcohol and Spaces and Places for Health and Wellbeing.  Round 2 of the Healthy Ireland Fund benefitted 950,000 citizens through the partnership actions of 3,930 organisations from a budget of &euro;5mil.  Therefore, each additional &euro;1mil would potentially extend the reach of the fund to engage more partner organisations to play their part in realising a Healthy Ireland and benefit an additional 190,000 citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The budget for Population Health and Wellbeing within the HSE, which implements much of the Healthy Ireland Framework, accounted for &euro;141mil for 2020.

A draft programme plan was considered by the programme sponsors in early 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 emergency.  In April 2020, recognising the need for a robust programme plan to support a reform of this scale, the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office engaged contractors to work with Sl&aacute;intecare, HSE and DOH to validate (insofar as possible) the draft programme plan for the service reconfiguration and development of the Regional Health Areas and develop recommendations to enhance the plan based upon international learnings and insights. This work was overseen by the programme sponsors and was completed in May. This report, including the enhanced programme plan, is being considered and finalised. As agreed, when the new Regional Health Areas geographies were announced last summer, a business plan for the establishment of these health areas is expected to be brought to Government for its approval.  The intention is that this plan will set out the high-level organisational design for the system, including: the respective roles, functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the Department of Health, HSE centre and new regional structures; the relationship between these entities; and the overall legal construct.

No. 540\/2003; if the change of status has been considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3259,"content":"<p>Naloxone is a medicine used to reverse the effect of opioid drugs such as heroin, morphine and codeine. It is contained in a number of medicinal products and presentations authorised on the Irish market for different indications including: in combination with opioid analgesics to counteract opioid-induced constipation; emergency treatment for respiratory depression associated with known or suspected opioid overdose or intoxication; or in combination with another drug to treat opioid dependence in persons who are also receiving medical, social and psychological support. Based on these authorised indications, use of naloxone on a regular basis should be subject to ongoing medical supervision. <\/p><p>Naloxone is listed in Part A of the First Schedule to the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 (S.I No. 540 of 2003), as amended (the &lsquo;Prescription Regulations&rsquo;). This essentially means that where it is supplied against a prescription, it may be dispensed one occasion only, also known as being non-repeatable.<\/p><p>Following the making of the Medicinal Products (Control of Placing on the Market) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 540 of 2007), as amended, the criteria for the determination of the classification of a medicinal product, is no longer ultimately determined by reference to the First Schedule to &lsquo;Prescription Regulations&rsquo;. The classification decision is now a matter for the marketing authorisation holder and the appropriate regulatory authority.<\/p><p>For a medicinal product to be available on the market in Ireland it must be granted a marketing authorisation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or by the European Commission, following a recommendation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<\/p><p>Regulation 9 of the 2007 Regulations requires that the marketing authorisation holder, at the time of application or renewal of a marketing authorisation should indicate whether the medicinal product is one which should be available either: on foot of a prescription; only from a pharmacy; or on general sale.<\/p><p>Regulation 12 of the 2007 Regulations then outlines the criteria that the HPRA must consider when making a determination of this supply classification. These criteria are transposed from EU requirements detailed in the Pharmaceutical Directive, Dir 2001\/83\/EC.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is up to the marketing authorisation holder to apply for a reclassification for its medicinal product and to supply the necessary evidence to support the safety of any such reclassification.  <\/p><p>For injectable forms of naloxone, under EU law, any medicinal products which are typically prescribed by a doctor to be administered parenterally (injected) shall be subject to a prescription. For intranasal forms of naloxone, indicated for emergency treatment for respiratory depression associated with known or suspected opioid overdose or intoxication, it would again be up to the marketing authorisation holder to seek a reclassification from the appropriate regulatory authority. <\/p><p>The only intranasal naloxone product currently marketed in Ireland, Nyxoid&reg; is authorised via the centralised procedure by the European Commission and is currently subject to prescription. Any applications to a change in supply classification would have to be made by the marketing authorisation holder to the EMA on behalf of the Commission. It could not be reclassified at a national level. <\/p><p>The marketing authorisation for Nyxoid&reg; states that it, &ldquo;should only be made available once the suitability and competence of an individual to administer naloxone in the appropriate circumstances has been established. Patients or any other person who might be in a position to administer Nyxoid&reg; must be instructed in its proper use and the importance of seeking medical assistance.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In addition, the Nyxoid&reg; marketing authorisation requires that a post-authorisation efficacy study on the effectiveness of intranasal naloxone administration by lay people in reversing opioid overdose be conducted. This study is scheduled for completion by the end of 2022.

Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns were raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, including a number of Ministerial representations from the women affected or on their behalf.  At that time, the Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p>  <p>  This CMO Report was published in November 2018. It was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. <\/p>  <p>  Since July 2018, the HSE has paused all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This was at the request of the CMO and undertaken in advance of completion of the final CMO report. The pause was instigated pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of initial recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO report made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications.  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p>  <p>  A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  The pathways for women experiencing mesh complications, established by the HSE, have been in place for over a year.  All appointments offered to women through these pathways have been to the public system.  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.  <\/p>  <p>  The Treatment Abroad Scheme is not available for patients wishing to have mesh related surgery for SUI or POP as there is currently a pause on mesh surgeries for these specific ailments.  The TAS scheme is not available for mesh removal, full or partial, as the treatment is available publicly in Irish hospitals.  <\/p>  <p>  On an interim basis, Translabial Scanning has been made available under the Treatment Abroad Scheme until the two scanners which have been purchased by the HSE are operational in the two Mesh Complications Centres.  As Translabial scanning is a diagnostic tool and not a &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; it does not normally qualify for this scheme however having listened to the requests from women for this specific type of scanning to be made available this interim measure was taken.  <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, considerable work has been done to date and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800114#WRQQQ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parliamentary Questions","counter":3286,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800114#WRQQQ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":3287,"qnumday":1189,"qnumall":"[21515\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800114#WRQQQ06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1306 of 16 October 2018, if issues raised in correspondence (details supplied) will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3288,"content":"<p>As part of Budget 2020, the previous Government announced two measures intended to reduce the cost of medicines: <\/p><p>- GMS prescription charges would be reduced by &euro;0.50c for all medical card holders.

The current standard of care in Ireland for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) involves testing of clinician-collected combined nasopharyngealoropharyngeal specimens with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). RT-PCR is considered the 'gold standard' in diagnostics for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the acute phase of infection.<\/p>  <p>  The collection of nasopharyngeal swabs by healthcare workers involves an invasive technique that is uncomfortable for the patient, which is of particular concern for paediatric populations. A relative degree of skill is required by the provider, and due to risk of transmission, the procedure necessitates substantial personal protective equipment.

The Plan recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted problem and needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.  Childhood obesity is a key priority under the Policy, as is reducing the inequalities seen in obesity rates, where children (and adults) from lower socioeconomic groups have higher levels of obesity.

Implementation of the Plan is overseen by a cross-sectoral and cross-Departmental Obesity Policy Implementation and Oversight Group chaired by the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  Achievements under the OPAP to date include the introduction of a Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax in May 2018, the publication of new Healthy Eating Guidelines, Food Pyramid and supporting resources in 2017, and the development of new Nutrition Standards for Schools, with an initial focus on school meal programmes funded by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Its purpose was to assess the quality and safety of the LUH Gynaecology Service, with a focus on the pathway of care for women presenting with post-menopausal bleeding including subsequent diagnostic pathways for potential gynaecological cancers.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Gynaecological Service Review for Letterkenny University Hospital (LUH) has now been completed and I have been assured by the HSE that the report has been shared with the patients and families who have been affected by the issues examined therein.  I appreciate that this is a difficult time for the patients and families, and I ask that we respect their privacy.  <\/p>  <p>  The report found that the LUH Gynaecology Service had a number of challenges, including large waiting lists, as well as poor governance and administrative practices which had led to delays and unsatisfactory service to patients.   The report makes six recommendations which it asserts, if implemented, would improve the clinical outcomes for patients and reduce delays.  These recommendations include increasing capacity and staff capability, reviewing the referral and triage system for gynaecology patients, improving communication processes and improving governance structures.  <\/p>  <p>  Separate to the clinical services review, a histological audit was also carried out by the Saolta Hospital Group.  The histological audit found that over a ten-year period (2010-2019) there were 38 women (including the 8 women identified in the Clinical Services Review) whose diagnosis of endometrial cancer was delayed (i.e. greater than 100 days).<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the Implementation Group led by the Clinical Director of the Women &amp;amp; Children&rsquo;s Management and Clinical Academic Network (MCAN) is currently being activated. The membership of this Group includes members of the senior clinical and management team in Letterkenny and the Saolta Group, a representative from General Practice in Co Donegal and service user representatives.  As part of the formation of this Group, a quality improvement action plan has been developed, the aim of which is to increase the gynaecological capacity within LUH in order to ensure that women consistently have timely access to appropriate investigations and treatment as well as improving patient triage, the appointment follow up process and clinical decision making. <\/p>  <p>In addition, a Special Measures Team (consisting of a senior gynaecologist and senior manager from Saolta) has been on site in LUH since the 5th   of July, identifying and driving operational changes. <\/p>  <p>  A national level Oversight Group will provide assurance to the HSE Chief Operations Officer that the recommendations set out in the Clinical Service Review Report are actively implemented and evaluated within an agreed timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  The Patient Advocacy Service is providing a support service to the patients and families affected by the issues raised in the report. The Patient Advocacy Service is an independent, free and confidential service that provides information and support to people who want to make a complaint about an experience they have had in a HSE-funded public acute hospital.<\/p>  <p>Patient safety remains a priority for me and my department.

The review was completed and the National TB Advisory Committee (NTBAC) met to consider its findings on 16 December 2019. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has been informed that the view of the Committee was that universal BCG vaccination should not be implemented at this time. The Committee agreed that the decision on whether a selective BCG vaccination programme targeting at risk groups or no BCG vaccination programme should be recommended, was outside the scope of the NTBAC and should be considered by the NIAC. <\/p>  <p>  The NIAC has been asked to make recommendations to the HSE about the BCG immunisation programme. This work by the Committee was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have now recommenced their considerations on this issue and hope to report to the HSE before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of these processes, once finalised, will guide my Department regarding the future provision of BCG vaccination in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800124#WRAAAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme","counter":3825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800124#WRAAAA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":3826,"qnumday":1379,"qnumall":"[22493\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800124#WRAAAA04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the withdrawal of the widely used ozempic weight control medication from the drugs payment scheme;

Detention of any person without consent is a serious matter that it can only happen in accordance with the law &ndash; in this case, the Mental Health Act 2001. This important Act ensures that the best interests of patients are central to any decision taken.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person is in the community, the process of involuntary detention under the 2001 Act is a three- step process. The first step requires an application, (which can be made by a spouse or relative, an authorised officer, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other person, subject to conditions set out in section 9(2) of the Act), followed by a recommendation by a GP that the person is suffering from a mental disorder and would benefit from a period of treatment in hospital.  The third step is the requirement that the consultant psychiatrist, following an assessment, diagnoses the person as suffering from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the Act, and authorises the involuntary admission of the person. Upon admission of a patient on an involuntary basis, a second examination by an independent consultant psychiatrist takes place to affirm or refuse the order.<\/p>  <p>  However, where a person has already been admitted on a voluntary basis and indicates that they wish to leave, then sections 23 and 24 of the 2001 Act allow the treating Consultant Psychiatrist to involuntarily admit the person, provided another Consultant Psychiatrist agrees that the person is suffering from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the Act. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to mention that in addition to the requirement to follow clear admission statutory procedures, the Act also gives every detained person the right to automatically have their involuntary admission reviewed. This means that such admissions must be reviewed by a Mental Health Tribunal made up of three independently appointed persons.  If the Mental Health Tribunal believes that the procedures for involuntary admission followed the law and that the person is suffering from a mental disorder, their decision will be to affirm the admission or renewal order.  If, however, the Mental Health Tribunal decides that the criteria for detention are not fulfilled, the Tribunal will direct that the person be discharged. A lawyer is also appointed by the Mental Health Commission to represent the detained person, free of charge, at the Mental Health Tribunal hearing. The person may continue to stay in hospital as a voluntary patient, if that is their choice and further treatment is indicated.  However, if they do not wish to remain, they must be discharged.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 28 of the Act, the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of an involuntary person must ensure that they are not inappropriately discharged and that they are detained only for so long as is reasonably necessary for their proper care and treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I should also add that it is important to point out that it is only people who have been diagnosed as having a mental disorder that can be detained under the 2001 Act.  The Act specifically prohibits the detention of persons by reason only of the fact that they are suffering from a personality disorder, are socially deviant or are addicted to drugs or intoxicants.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the present safeguards in the 2001 Act, I am pleased to say that a draft bill is being drawn up to amend the Act based on the recommendations of an Expert Group Review of the Act.  The intention of the changes proposed will be to strengthen the safeguards of persons liable to detention under the Act and ensure that the Act fully respects the autonomy of individuals who have capacity to make their own decisions regarding treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The review has further taken into account developments in terms of Ireland's international obligations, such as the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, as well as recent legislative changes in Ireland, including the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and the proposed Protection of Liberty safeguards.  These changes and others, when included in revised mental health legislation, will further improve the protections available to mental health service users. The Department is currently consulting with the Mental Health Commission and the HSE on the draft heads, and hopes to finalise the draft heads in the by the end of 2020, depending on the timely provision of input from stakeholders and legal advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800125#WRBBBB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":3898,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800126#WRCCCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3899,"qnumday":1406,"qnumall":"[22690\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800126#WRCCCC00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on children with ASD being sent to mainstream schools that are not suited for their needs and demands; the process that parents must engage in to address the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1613","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3900,"content":"<p>Admission Policy for ASD classes and Special Schools are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills to whom I understand the Deputy has tabled a similar question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800126#WRCCCC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":3901,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800126#WRCCCC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":3902,"qnumday":1407,"qnumall":"[22698\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800126#WRCCCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will the review the advice on spectators attending sporting events with a view to revising the permitted number upwards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3903,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday 18 August, 2020 the Government decided to implement a number of enhanced public health measures in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19.<\/p><p>These measures were introduced in response to an increase in the number of cases in recent weeks, with multiple outbreaks across workplaces, households, and in sports clubs.

The Programme for Government places a positive emphasis on animal welfare and specifically commits to the continued robust enforcement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  This Act provides a modern framework for applying standards in the area of animal health and welfare and replaced a number of enactments dating back over a century.  The Act was passed, after a lengthy and constructive debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and came into operation on 6 March 2014.   <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to the policy that animal welfare standards are vigorously applied in a fair and even-handed manner. Those responsible for causing unnecessary suffering to animals or being negligent regarding animal welfare will continue to be sanctioned where appropriate, up to and including prosecution through the Courts should the evidence so warrant.  This policy applies to horses kept in urban areas as well as to other animals.<\/p>  <p>  Neglect of or causing unnecessary suffering to animals is not acceptable in our society.  My Department continues to enforce the law in this important area as does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs service of the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  My Department works closely with these bodies and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all involved for their work in the field of animal welfare.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has prosecuted eleven persons under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 for offences involving horses; a further 4 cases remain before the Courts. This does not include cases initiated by other prosecuting authorities in respect of which my Department does not have information. <\/p>  <p>  Over 170 equines have been seized by officers based in my Department&rsquo;s network of regional offices in the past 4 years.<\/p>  <p>  My Department dedicates a substantial level of resources and funding to animal welfare. This follows from last year when the largest ever allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m was made to 106 animal welfare bodies, a number of which undertake work with urban horses. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to double the grant aid to animal welfare organisations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas. In the context of preventing over-breeding and consequential welfare problems, my Department provides financial assistance to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal to operate castration clinics and facilitate education programmes. These initiatives highlight the importance of appropriate welfare education and increase awareness among the community at large.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has funded four courses relating to equine welfare targeted at horse owners.  My Department also takes part in the Dublin Region Horse Welfare Working Group with local authorities and relevant non-Government organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, local authorities may make bye-laws relating to the keeping of horses. Local authorities may take a range of other actions in relation to equines including the seizure and disposal of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission.<\/p>  <p>  The Chief Executive of a local authority may appoint authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.

To this end increasing afforestation levels across all 12 planting categories  that make up the Afforestation Scheme is supported.

These broadleaves can also be planted along the forest edge to soften the visual effect of the main forest crop and also to provide an additional habitat.  <\/p>  <p>  Areas of Biodiversity Enhancement (ABE) are also created as part of new planting.  These comprise open spaces, retained habitat and widely spaced native trees.  Their function is to conserve and encourage the development of diverse habitats, native flora, fauna, and biodiversity, to protect archaeological monuments and to facilitate an enhanced forest design. New plantations are encouraged to plant up to 15% ABE and most plantations achieve this level.<\/p>  <p>  Native woodlands attract the highest payment rates within the afforestation scheme and are perhaps the most complex and biodiverse habitats in the country.  As well as representing reservoirs of biodiversity, these deliver other important ecosystem services, such as water and soil protection, wider habitat linkage and carbon sequestration. Two of the grant and premium categories (GPCs) in the current afforestation scheme, are specifically targeted at native woodland establishment. The mid-term review of the Forestry Programme, completed in 2018, increased the rates for these planting categories in order to encourage more landowners to plant native trees.

The Programme for Government places a positive emphasis on animal welfare and specifically commits to the continued robust enforcement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  This Act provides a modern framework for applying standards in the area of animal health and welfare and replaced a number of enactments dating back over a century.  The Act was passed, after a lengthy and constructive debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas and came into operation on 6 March 2014.   <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to the policy that animal welfare standards are vigorously applied in a fair and even-handed manner. Those responsible for causing unnecessary suffering to animals or being negligent regarding animal welfare will continue to be sanctioned where appropriate, up to and including prosecution through the Courts should the evidence so warrant.  This policy applies to horses kept in urban areas as well as to other animals.<\/p>  <p>  Neglect of or causing unnecessary suffering to animals is not acceptable in our society.  My Department continues to enforce the law in this important area as does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs service of the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  My Department works closely with these bodies and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all involved for their work in the field of animal welfare.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has prosecuted eleven persons under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 for offences involving horses; a further 4 cases remain before the Courts. This does not include cases initiated by other prosecuting authorities in respect of which my Department does not have information. <\/p>  <p>  Over 170 equines have been seized by officers based in my Department&rsquo;s network of regional offices in the past 4 years.<\/p>  <p>  My Department dedicates a substantial level of resources and funding to animal welfare. This follows from last year when the largest ever allocation of funding from my Department of &euro;2.906m was made to 106 animal welfare bodies, a number of which undertake work with urban horses. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to double the grant aid to animal welfare organisations.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department continues to support a number of urban horse projects nationwide, bringing education on all aspects of equine welfare to disadvantaged areas. In the context of preventing over-breeding and consequential welfare problems, my Department provides financial assistance to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal to operate castration clinics and facilitate education programmes. These initiatives highlight the importance of appropriate welfare education and increase awareness among the community at large.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has funded four courses relating to  equine welfare targeted at horse owners.  My Department also takes part in  the Dublin Region Horse Welfare Working Group with local authorities and relevant non-Government organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Control of Horses Act 1996, local authorities may make bye-laws relating to the keeping of horses. Local authorities may take a range of other actions in relation to equines including the seizure and disposal of straying horses which includes horses put on land without the owner&rsquo;s permission.<\/p>  <p>  The Chief Executive of a local authority may appoint authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.

My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable.  All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  <\/p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place. A majority of my Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee which gives confidence in these revised procedures. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. <\/p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritises files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  <\/p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment under the Programme for Government to review the forestry appeals process to ensure that it is aligned with other comparable appeals processes. That is why a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced.  The public consultation period for the draft Bill recently closed, with almost 9,000 submissions received.  These submissions will inform the updated version of the Bill  which will  be presented to the Oireachtas.  The introduction of these amendments will be accompanied by an on-line portal on which forestry licence applications and site details will be easily accessible to any interested party.<\/p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800127#WRDDDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":3974,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800127#WRDDDD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":3975,"qnumday":1431,"qnumall":"[21784\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800127#WRDDDD01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the way in which he plans to address animal welfare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":3976,"content":"<p>The framework for addressing the Government&rsquo;s policy of promoting the optimum level of animal welfare in Ireland is provided by the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.

Any Irish sea-fishing boat with the appropriate licence conditions is eligible to fish for lobster.  The Report of the Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats for 2019 indicates that this may number up to 1,400 vessels.  However, these vessels are also eligible to fish for certain other species and the business model varies from boat to boat.  <\/p><p>Like many elements of Irish seafood, the lobster fishery relies on a healthy export market.  BIM&rsquo;s Business of Irish Seafood report values Irish lobster exports in 2019 at &euro;15m.  European markets remain significant for Irish seafood exports, including lobster, and the impact of COVID-19 on the hospitality, retail and caf&eacute; sectors across the EU and elsewhere has undoubtedly made 2020 a difficult trading year for many elements of the Irish seafood sector.  <\/p><p>Recently BIM has reported some recovery in prices to fishers which aligns with the step-back of COVID-19 restrictions and re-opening measures happening in many countries over the past number of weeks as we all learn to live with the virus. My Department continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on key destinations for Irish food exports and to work with all sectors, within the regulatory framework, to develop responsive measures.<\/p><p>On 21 August, the EU Commission and the United States announced agreement on a package of tariff reductions on a range of products, including US live and frozen lobster products.  If EU imports of US lobster increase significantly it could combine to further impact on prices and demand - however, the US also exports to other international markets.  The US lobster (<i>homarus americanus)<\/i>is not the same species as the European lobster <i>(homarus gammarus) <\/i>although both are fished wild which acts as a constraint on supply<i>.  <\/i>The EU Commission figures indicate that last year the EU27 imported &euro;42 million of lobster products from the US (15% of overall extra-EU imports), out of a market worth &euro;290million in total and in which EU producers are supplying less than 5% of EU consumption.

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulation's articles.<\/p>  <p>  In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006\/130\/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.<\/p>  <p>  There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019\/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed.  For example, antiparasitic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019\/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website www.hpra.ie.<\/p>  <p>  The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019\/6. It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with existing national legislation, from January 2022 antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants. This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to supply them in the future but from January 2022 onwards, a veterinary prescription will be needed to dispense them.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing resistance to veterinary medicinal products is not in the interests of any stakeholder in the agri-sector. My Department is focused on the acknowledged need to protect these products, recognising their importance in modern agriculture, and to ensure that they remain effective into the future.  It is imperative to protect the efficacy of the drugs we have available currently as it is not envisaged that any new drugs are imminent. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenges posed to numerous stakeholders by changing the route of supply to &lsquo;Prescription Only Medicine&rsquo; for antiparasitic products, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO). Its first meeting was held in mid-June and its second meeting takes place in September. This group will examine all the issues related to the changed route of supply with the primary objective of protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme","counter":4061,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":4062,"qnumday":1461,"qnumall":"[22413\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE04800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the reasons one third of approved TAMS applications do not progress to a claim will be addressed; the effect of same on approving new applicants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4063,"content":"<p>The indicative allocation for the TAMS II scheme over the course of the Rural Development Programme is &euro;395 million.

The focus of the review was on the policy approach and associated support schemes, considering the move away from Ash Dieback eradication and bringing ash plantation management into focus. The review included further consideration of damage level evaluation together with inclusion of a broader range of silvicultural and management options. This new approach was circulated for stakeholder consultation in December 2019 and a total of 18 submissions were received in reply. <\/p>  <p>  All submissions were carefully considered, and a number of meetings held with stakeholders to finalise a new scheme document. It was decided during scheme design to focus resources on plantations under 25 years as most ash plantations beyond this age would have attained some size and therefore would be of some commercial value.<\/p>  <p>  The Department does however provide some options for ash plantations 25 years and over that are affected by Ash Dieback disease. Under the Woodland Improvement Scheme (WIS), two thinning interventions are available for these plantations. Where the owner has already received funding for the first intervention (&euro;750\/ha), grant aid of &euro;500\/ha is available for a second intervention. Another option for plantations 25 years old and over is to consider switching to a continuous cover forestry management regime. Under Element 2 of WIS, forest owners may be eligible for three tranches of &euro;750\/ha over 12 years or two if funding for a first thinning under WIS was received. <\/p>  <p>  My Department does not have any plans to amend the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Safety","counter":4073,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE05900"},{"type":"question","counter":4074,"qnumday":1465,"qnumall":"[22419\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE06000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a group (details supplied) if he will consider providing future support to such an organisation and community lead safety scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":4075,"qnumday":1466,"qnumall":"[22420\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE06100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the requirements for an organisation engaged in the promotion of farm safety to apply for and avail of Government funding; the relevant schemes in relation to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4076,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1465 and 1466 together.<\/p><p>I am advised that the group has made contact with my colleague, Minister Martin Heydon and that a meeting is being arranged with the group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800128#WREEEE06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":4079,"qnumday":1467,"qnumall":"[22421\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020090800129#WRFFFF00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there is a scheme to assist those that have suffered a farm accident to adapt their farm and machinery in order to support their continued working on the farm; if not, if consideration will be given to such a scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":4080,"content":"<p>Farm safety is a critical issue facing farming today.

The aim of this initiative was to explore how to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages and, at the same time, address the issue of vacant properties. Funding of up to &euro;100,000 was made available for this purpose through the Local Authorities, focusing on 6 towns with different characteristics in different parts of the country. <\/p><p>An independent report on the pilot Town Centre Living Initiative was published on 22nd June 2020.
