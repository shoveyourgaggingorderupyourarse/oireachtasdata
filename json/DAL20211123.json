GP services are overwhelmed, and schools are struggling.  In large swathes of the country, people cannot get a PCR test while the Government still dithers on antigen testing.  In our hospitals, especially ICUs, we see the sharpest impact.  The capacity crisis in ICUs did not happen overnight.  A HSE-commissioned expert report published in September 2009 recommended that the number of intensive care unit beds be increased from 289 to 579.  Successive Governments have known about this problem for more than a decade and have done nothing.  They cut a further 40 beds out of the system between the publication of that report in 2009 and the onset of Covid.<\/p>  <p>  This lack of foresight has continued throughout the pandemic.  The vaccination programme and lockdowns bought precious time to prepare hospital capacity for surges but the Government has wasted these opportunities.  Even in the recent budget, it tinkered around the edges with ICU capacity.  We do not have the necessary number of personnel to staff our ICUs safely, even in normal times.  Experts tell us that we need between 150 and 200 additional ICU beds and more specialist staff for hospitals to cope.  The failure to properly resource our hospitals has devastating consequences and serious knock-on effects for our society.  Protecting our health service from collapse is a key reason for the prolonged use of restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  Lack of capacity also has dangerous consequences for those requiring vital care and life-saving procedures.  Earlier this month, a transplant operation was cancelled in Dublin's Mater hospital because no ICU bed was available.  I cannot imagine how distressing this was for the patient, the patient's family and for the doctors who had to make this call.  There should have been an ICU bed for this patient and there would have been if the Government had planned properly.  We are already playing catch-up on missed non-Covid care.  We are facing a tsunami of missed care in the coming months.  Not having the additional ICU capacity is putting patients at risk.  The Government continues to turn up a day late and a dollar short.  We are two years into the pandemic and 12 years into the ICU capacity crisis and the Government has not even come close to doing enough for ICU capacity.  As we watch our hospitals fill up again and restrictions are reimposed, people are asking what the Government is waiting for.<\/p> <p>T&aacute; an ganntanas leapacha sna hionaid dianch&uacute;raim, ICU, ag cur br&uacute; ar na hospid&eacute;il agus ag cur na n-othar i mbaol.

There are four broad areas where we have to deal with this fourth wave.  Overall, Ireland's performance so far in terms of the pandemic, on the key metric of mortality and in terms of protecting life and severe illness, stands up to most countries across Europe and the globe.  We have been, relatively, in the better position consistently for quite some time because of measures that we have taken.  That should be acknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the House that the booster campaign is well under way, with over 600,000 boosters having been already administered.  This is on top of a record and highly effective overall vaccination roll-out programme in which we have close to 93% of the adult population fully vaccinated.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of hospital beds, we have provided close to 1,000 extra beds overall in 2021, with more still to be provided.  In the last year and a half to two years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of hospital beds.  In terms of intensive care beds, we have gone from 225 to 300 within the system but we will have to go further in 2022, at a minimum to get to 340 intensive care beds.  I would like to go beyond that.  We have recruited close to 11,000 people throughout 2020 and 2021.  The key issue now is not resources, because the Government has provided the resources for intensive care beds, hospital beds and additional staff, but the speed at which we can recruit and provide the entire capacity that an ICU bed requires.  We have surge capacity to 350, if necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  The hospitals are under pressure because of a very transmissible variant, namely, the Delta variant.  That is now manifesting itself in a fourth wave.  Parallel with that has been the reopening of society.  We have not had prolonged restrictions.  We have reopened the economy and we have reopened society.  Let us be honest, the increased socialisation that automatically follows that degree of reopening of almost all sectors of the economy in society leads to an increase in infections.  This is a balance that we have to strike.  Thousands of people have returned to work and that is good for those people in terms of their individual lives and so forth.  The overarching objective of our policy in regard to Covid is to protect lives and to prevent severe illness.  The motivating factor in terms of our responses now is to stop people getting Covid and to stop people getting sick and severely ill from Covid.  There are a number of ways we can do that.  It is through a combination of all of those ways that we do it.  <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the operation, I believe it should have gone ahead.  There is enormous pressure on the Mater hospital.  I set up that unit when I was for Minister for Health.  We broke new ground in terms of heart and lung transplant.  There was a big debate at the time as to whether we could pull that off in terms of the numbers of cases coming through the country.  I took a decision at the time to do it and to fund it.  It is a cause of great regret to me that a transplant did not go ahead.  There is an internal inquiry or investigation going on within the Mater in that regard.  Suffice to say, we will do everything we possibly can to protect lives and to protect people from getting very sick from Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300004#B00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1637676300,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Despite the Taoiseach's attempts to reassure or to advance the pretence that we have enough capacity in our hospitals, the evidence is that we had staff protesting outside Connolly hospital and, for example, in Limerick hospital other beds are being repurposed for use as ICU beds.<\/p> <p>It is very clear the capacity falls well short of what is needed and that fact was established as far back as 2009.  The fact also is that there was not an ICU bed for that transplant operation to occur, which was very traumatic for all concerned, particularly the patient and the patient's family.<\/p> <p> To make it clear for the D&aacute;il, what is the plan now for ICU capacity as infection numbers are growing and hospitalisations increase?

Recruitment and training of staff will be the key ingredient there; it will not be an absence of resources.  Currently, we have 130 people in ICU, as of today, and 638 in hospital.  These are large numbers which, in themselves and in addition to non-Covid illnesses, are creating a lot of pressure on intensive care staff and hospital staff in general, who have had to deal with a once in a century pandemic for the guts of two years.  That is extremely pressurising on any employee, particularly patient-facing employees and those in the engine room of the ICU in particular.  It is very challenging and difficult and I acknowledge that.  This is why we have made it clear we will provide whatever resources are required to continue to give the capacity to the HSE in terms of how it operates hospitals and so on, with the clinical staff needed to deal with the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300005#C00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1637676900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I would like to pass on my best wishes to the Ceann Comhairle and wish him a speedy recovery from Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I want to continue on the issue of capacity in intensive care units.  As stated, an organ was unable to be used for transplant because of a lack of capacity in ICU.  Transplant operations are very complex and may, on many occasions, be cancelled for a number of compatibility reasons.  However, for an operation to be cancelled because of a lack of an ICU bed is cripplingly devastating to the person who needed that transplant and the person's family.  It is also very difficult for organ donors and their families throughout the country, who really want their organs to go to help and cure others.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is struggling to run the country around a hospital system that is breaking down.  That is a fact.  We are creating policy and trying to protect our society around a hospital system that is broken down.  At the centre of that is ICU capacity.  The EU average for ICU beds is 11.5 per 100,000 of population.  In Ireland, it is just under 6.5 per 100,000.  The Department's own capacity review in 2018, before Covid, undertook to have 330 ICU beds by the end of 2021.  The Taoiseach mentioned that resources are not an issue.  However, we are at the end of 2021 and, at just under 300 beds, we are nowhere near 330.  With resources not being an issue, why are we not near that target?<\/p>  <p>  Dr. Catherine Motherway, in another arresting contribution on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning, said that, with the Delta variant, it is likely that everyone in this country will get Covid at some stage and it is vital we slow down that spread.  Unfortunately, the booster campaign is playing catch-up with a virus that is running rampant throughout our society.  Delayed decision-making from the Government has impacted the ability of the booster campaign to roll out effectively.  Some people are being called for boosters very early but there are older people who have not been called yet.  They are waiting by the telephone for a call that has not come and are losing faith it will come.  The world-beating mass vaccination infrastructure that made us so proud is still focused on the first and second vaccines, not the booster.  When will that infrastructure be shifted to the booster campaign?  At the moment, it is going primarily through the GP service and that is leading to delays, frustration and people not getting their booster in time.<\/p> <p>Tens of thousands of people are trying to get PCR tests, with demand outstripping supply.  How many permanent intensive care unit, ICU, beds, not including surge capacity beds, will be in place by the end of this year?

It is important that we continue to do the vaccinations.  Some 1,900 people came forward over the weekend for their first dose.  That is good news.  Those were people who may not have been easily accessed by the system, but they came forward to vaccination centres.  We have to help people consistently to access our system.  We have had a voluntary system so far.  It has been spectacularly successful, if we are honest, for dose one and dose two, compared with other countries that are getting more hard line and mandatory in their approach, but are still at approximately 60%.  We are at 90% plus.  We just need to work with particular groups that may not have had the same degree of confidence in the vaccines as the general population has had.  That is beginning to yield fruit.  The vast bulk of the vaccinations now are booster vaccinations and over 600,000 have now been administered.  The GPs were always the conduit for administering vaccines for the elderly cohorts of the population.  As one moves down the age cohorts, there is greater utilisation of vaccination centres and healthcare workers as well.  There is a variety of options for healthcare workers.  There has been very good progress made in over 80s and over 70s - very good progress was made last week - and over 60s.  The booster campaign is progressing apace.  It will increase in capacity.  One cannot go earlier than five months to get a booster.  There is no clinical mandate from anybody to go earlier than five months.  One has to wait for five months after the second dose before one gets the booster.  The pharmacies are on board now.  The pharmacies, the GPs and the vaccination centres are all on board with the booster campaign in particular.  There is no issue with supply in the boosters.<\/p>  <p>  On testing, we should acknowledge that last week and in the last seven days, 207,000 PCR tests were done.  That is an extraordinary number in itself, given the size of our population.  We have now been hitting 200,000.  Every available mechanism is being used to increase capacity on PCR tests.  We have also broadly widened participation in antigen testing, particularly through close contacts.  There are now 3,000 close contacts per day being issued with free antigen tests.  The schools, working with the HSE, on 29 November will begin the operationalisation of the use of antigen testing in school settings, where appropriate.

Last year, I and others in opposition asked the HSE to set up facilities in airports.  The Opposition has been trying to give practical solutions over the course of this pandemic.  If we had been listened to at the time we would not be scrambling for private capacity to be used to try to meet demand for PCR testing.  It is still not working.  It is still not enough.

The Central Statistics Office has confirmed that the rise in prices in October was the largest seen since April 2007.  The squeeze on the household budget is due to the Government over-exhausting and crippling the PAYE sector, particularly those living in rural areas.  I am going to make it very simple.  I have a payslip here from week 33 of the current tax year.  If someone earns &euro;500 net into their hand per week, it will cost the employer and the employee &euro;680.65.  The employer pays &euro;67.73 PRSI for the employee, who is a single person.  PAYE deducts &euro;74.22 per week while the USC deducted is &euro;14.18 and the PRSI &euro;24.52.  That is &euro;180.65, which allows the employee to take home &euro;500 per week.  Now we must adjust this for the cost of living.  An average person commuting to work and with family commitments, in County Limerick, will spend &euro;100 a week on fuel.  The Government takes &euro;57 out of that &euro;100.  Food for a single moderate person is &euro;20 per day, which equals &euro;140 per week.  The Government gets &euro;26 out of that.  The ESB bill costs per week &euro;30 and the Government gets &euro;6.40 out of that.  Heating costs, which include coal, timber or oil to heat the family home, are roughly &euro;40 per week and the Government takes &euro;7.48 out of that.  Clothes and footwear cost about &euro;1,560 a year, which equals &euro;30 a week, and the Government takes &euro;6.40 out of that &euro;30.

It is the social contract, to varying degrees.  We might disagree as to where the balance of the social contract is but the social contract is society raising revenue through the elected government of the day and rebalancing that revenue out in education services, childcare services, health services, mental health services and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>These are the very issues that Deputies will consistently come into the House and raise with Ministers, asking why we do not have extra money to spend on this or on that.  We have a very strong social welfare code in Ireland which requires a lot of revenue and that revenue has to be raised.  Substantial revenues have to be raised.  People may argue that it is not enough and others will argue differently but we cannot get away from the fact that huge sums of money are involved in social protection, education and health in particular which reflects the majority view in terms of how we want to organise society.  The Government must raise revenue on behalf of society to be able to do the things it wants to do and that involves PRSI as well.  One of the big challenges in higher and further education is the need to dramatically increase the number of skills programmes to upskill the economy for retrofitting, offshore wind and apprenticeships generally across all of the trades.  That is working and the funding we have provided is definitely yielding results in terms of increased applications for apprenticeships.<\/p> <p> A balance must be struck but I accept that there is a big pressure on energy prices at the moment.  I have no doubt about that and agree with the Deputy.  We brought in a modest taxation package in the budget which was designed to make a contribution towards helping people.  We also increased the fuel allowance and provided other welfare increases to try to cushion the blow from higher energy prices.  The Government is keeping under review the issue of the impact of global energy price increases on households.  I fully accept that energy prices are putting pressure on many families and households but this is very much a global phenomenon.  The European Central Bank is saying that it will be a short-term issue and that after the first quarter of next year, prices will begin to recede but we will have to monitor and review that very closely to see what further help we can give.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300007#E00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637678100,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's answer to the people was to put a 2% increase on fuel.

Covid has exacerbated it, but it is still an issue.  I raised this several times with the Minister for Education last year and she kept telling me about the supply panels.  I will come back to that in a moment.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, did a survey in November which showed the extent of this problem.  In many ways, we were ahead of it in Sligo because a number of surveys were done in September and October in 32 schools, where there were 473 absences that required substitution.  Some 22 schools, or 69%, had access to supply panels.  The panel for those 22 schools supplied 15% of the substitutes.  Some 27% of cases were covered either by special education teachers, principals or were simply not covered.  Of the remaining ten schools that did not have access to supply panels, there was no substitute available 34% of the time.  That is one in every three days.  They were mainly the smaller schools that do not have flexibility within them to juggle teachers.  Many comments were made by teachers and principals about this, but I do not have time to read them.  Basically, they are saying that they make between 15 and 25 calls and they cannot get substitutes.  This is a crisis.  It is worse now than it was before.<\/p> <p> Today, we hear the Minister is meeting representatives from the teacher education colleges, but this should have happened this time last year.  This is bad management.  I hate to say that, but it needs to be called out for what it is.  When we are in a crisis we must take unprecedented actions.  The Taoiseach has done this in other areas, so I do not know why it has not been done in education.  Many fourth year students in teacher training colleges are already substituting, so one could ask where we look.  Do we look to retired teachers, teachers on secondment or those in the inspectorate for a short period to get us over this hump?  It is not ideal.  Nothing is ideal in a pandemic and anybody who says it is, is not reasonable, but we expect proper planning to deal with this ongoing and escalating problem.  I ask the Taoiseach what we are going to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300008#F00400","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637678400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Harkin that given the once-in-a-century nature of the global pandemic we need to take measures now in respect of teacher substitution which would we not take in ordinary &quot;peace&quot; time.  I will put it that way to the Deputy.  That does mean that all stakeholders, be they regulatory or unions, must show some degree of flexibility as well.  Today's meeting with the higher education institutions is not the first engagement between the Minister and the institutions.  There have been challenges in terms of attendance for the theory side and so on.  In my view, flexibility must be shown in regard to student teachers, as they could go a long way towards helping.<\/p><p>In addition, we must look at other areas.  Retirement has been considered and good, constructive flexibility has been shown by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of facilitating additionality in that regard.  The Minister is exploring other areas with the education partners.  Flexibility should be shown on all sides to get us through this period in respect of substitute teachers.  The Minister has already provided significant additional resources in terms of the further 100 teachers who were allocated to supply panels where the Department had identified areas of greatest need.  The supply panels now employ 480 teachers.  They provide substitute cover to almost 2,600 primary schools across the country.  They work alongside the more traditional existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers such as the national substitution portal service, <i>subseeker.ie<\/i>, operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and developed under the Department's teacher supply action plan.  In any one month or year, there can be a whole variety of reasons substitute teaching is required to replace existing teachers.<\/p> <p>Notwithstanding that, given the fact we are in the middle of a pandemic, we have to show, and all the stakeholders involved, in my view, will have to show, flexibility in respect of the utilisation of student teachers and, indeed, other alternative methods of providing teachers.  We have many qualified people who may not necessarily, for example, have the teaching qualifications <i>per se<\/i>but who would have degrees and so on.  These are issues we need to look at.  Given the circumstances and given the fact the vaccination campaign has been very strong and the booster is rolling out, if everybody put their heads together, we could get a resolution to this or certainly alleviate the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300009#G00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637678700,"counter":30,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach said, it is a once-in-a-century happening.

I agree the Minister has given resources but the truth is they are not enough because it is a once-in-a-century happening - the Taoiseach said it himself.  Therefore, in a situation like this, we have to make sure the resources we put in place will support the systems, like education, which the Taoiseach and all his colleagues believe is one of the most important systems to support.  The Taoiseach spoke of supply panels.  All I can tell him is that one third of schools in Sligo do not even have access to supply panels, never mind being able to get teachers from them.

I remember many years ago, when I was the Minister for Education, the idea of introducing a qualified Montessori teacher to primary schools was something that was anathema to all and sundry who are in primary education.  There can sometimes be too rigid and bureaucratic an approach to what we should do in the middle of a pandemic like this.  That is my point.  I am sure the stakeholders will work with the Minister to resolve this.  The Minister has gone a long way in terms of providing the resources and it is not a funding resource issue.  I think the student teachers offer an opportunity, as Deputies articulated last week, in particular Deputy Cathal Crowe, and there are other issues around the 22 hours, for example, and the mechanisms there.

The legislation I am introducing today, the Seller's Legal Pack for Property Buyers Bill 2021, will reduce conveyancing transaction times and, as a result, streamline the costs associated with that, help to cut out gazumping and gazundering, allow for more certain and transparent transactions for property and afford protection to sellers and, more crucially, the consumer.  The chief executive officer of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers approached me some time ago expressing the wish that legislation be brought forward to give effect to measures that arose from the institute's research and borne out in research dating back as far as 2005 when we had the auctioneering and estate agency review group, which expressed the wish at that time that buyers and sellers be better informed about the conveyancing process to enable sellers to take a greater role in the sale and conveyancing of their properties.  <\/p><p>The research by the institute showed that 81% of estate agents presiding over the sale of property found it to be either frustrating or very frustrating in terms of the delay, ultimately for the consumer.  This delay adds costs in conveyancing in that so often it is only when a property is sale agreed that the assembly, in terms of the documentation that is required to give effect to the sale, begins.  This measure would prescribe in advance that a statutory process must be followed by all property service professionals, that is, before they would place a property on the market, they would be bound to ensure that all the necessary documentation would be in place, thereby ensuring for the seller, the efficiency of the process and, for the consumer who is seeking to buy, certainty in terms of the transparency of the process, and that what we see is what we are getting and what is being bought is as it alleges to be.  Over the years, we have seen young buyers' mortgage approvals elapse while lengthy conveyancing takes place where, for example, an unforeseen planning permission or some such documentation is not put in place.  <\/p><p>I pay tribute to Pat Davitt and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers for having the courage to bring forward this proposal, which ultimately is a consumer measure.  Property professionals are often criticised.  This is one area where they are seeking to put the consumer first.  Everybody will benefit.  Taking the average sale, currently it takes 15 weeks to deal with conveyancing and, perhaps, a further six weeks to effect the sale.  There is no reason for any party or individual in the House to do anything other than support this legislation.  As a non-aligned Member of the House for now, the only facility open to me to progress this legislation is to enter it into the weekly lottery of Private Members' legislation in order that it can move to Second Stage.  As I said, this is a win-win for sellers, consumers as the ultimate purchasers, the legal professional, auctioneers and estate agents and their oversight in terms of regulation.  It has been welcomed in its embryonic stage by the legal profession, engineers, valuers, estate agents and regulators.  I very much hope that Government and Opposition alike will grab this opportunity with both hands to give this positive development the momentum it requires and take the word of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, which has put this forward through me, and give effect to these small but very effective improvements for what can be a complex and lengthy process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300017#Q01600","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1637681700,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300017#Q01700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1637681700,"counter":124,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300017#Q01800","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637681700,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1637681700,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300017#Q02000","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1637681700,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300017#Q02100","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637681700,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna -

SIAs seek to answer questions about the impact of Government expenditure, such as whether the policy change in question resulted in a quantifiable gain or loss to existing recipients, who gained the most or least and whether the profile of recipients was altered.  The assessments are underpinned by a framework paper published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2016.  The framework complements existing budgetary impact assessment exercises conducted by various Departments and externally by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, as well as the annual spending review programme.  SIAs attempt to measure changes in income as a result of a policy or offer qualitative descriptions of how policies affect the financial positions of households.  In so doing, they examine the distributional impact of policy changes across a range of indicators, including income, age, household composition and region.<\/p>  <p>  SIAs have been carried out across a number of policy areas, including health, housing, education and childcare.  Those areas were chosen for a social impact assessment on the basis that a significant portion of public expenditure is spent on them, they remain a high priority and they have been subject to budgetary changes in recent years.  As my Department does not have responsibility for major expenditure programmes in areas like health or housing, it has not completed any SIAs under the framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300018#R00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1637682300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach noted, the social impact assessment framework examines the demographic profile of public services users and how they are impacted by the Government's budgetary decisions.  We are told these assessments should complement other budget impact assessments such as equality budgeting, which was first introduced as a pilot scheme four years ago.  The 2019 OECD scan of equality budgeting in Ireland highlighted significant challenges and shortfalls in the initiative's structure and implementation.  The OECD recommended that equality budgeting be expanded beyond the performance budgeting foundation to link it with other robust budget policy tools used in Ireland.  It advised this should include expanding existing poverty proofing of policies to look at how poverty intersects with different equality dimensions.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis of next year's budget undertaken by the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, on behalf of the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, tells us the OECD's recommendations have fallen on deaf ears.  TASC's analysis found the Government is unlikely to improve gender economic inequality, with lone parents likely to be worse off.  It found the gender pay gap may widen, women may be at high risk of unemployment as pandemic supports expire, the increase in the minimum wage is insufficient to maintain the living standards of those trying to survive on low pay, and funding for childcare is still woefully inadequate.  I want to echo the NWCI's call on the Government to prioritise gender and equality proofing of budgetary decisions in order that public spending will promote equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300018#R01000","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1637682300,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.

It is not bad enough that they are homeless; they are going to be evicted from being homeless to become roofless.  One of the householders got a letter yesterday saying the family has two days to be out of the hotel in which they have been staying.  Both families have been homeless for three years.<\/p>  <p>  What is their crime?  The parents got a bit of work.  For people with a council or housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy, they do not get thrown out of it because they get work.  For people who are homeless, however, who get a job and whose earnings go up a bit, they will be evicted from homeless accommodation and told they will get no more housing support and they are off the housing list.  They are thrown to the wolves.  That is happening this week and I am hearing of similar cases.  It is all because the income thresholds were not raised.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something urgently about this.  In the next two days, a family will put out of homeless accommodation and onto the street.

Does he accept that this miserable increase will not be sufficient to prevent hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of preventable deaths this winter?

First, on equality budgeting and the general approach of Government under the social impact assessment framework, approximately 17 papers have been published since 2016 under the social impact assessment, SIA, framework, embracing education, childcare, energy, poverty, disability and health, including mental health.  I mention the assessment of living standards, results of the 2019 survey on income and living conditions, SILC, the SEAI programmes targeting energy poverty, in 2020, the student grant scheme, which resulted in improvements, the specialist disability services for people intellectual disability, and, in 2021, the results of the SILC.  In 2019, there was the acute mental health services, assessment of living standards, the survey on income and living conditions, the nursing home support scheme, public service, equality budgeting - relevant findings from ex post valuation, domiciliary care allowance and so on.<\/p><p>Basically, the SWITCH model, deployed by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is also used in assessing budgetary measures Government takes as well as the fairness of those budgetary measures and whether they are progressive or regressive.  That model by the Economic and Social Research Institute supplements and complements the work of the SAI framework.<\/p><p>I mention the assessment of living standards, results from the 2019 survey on incomes and living conditions which was conducted by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  Again, it analysed income, poverty, social exclusion indicator trends and how they have changed with economic cycles.  Recent budgets have been progressive.  That paper demonstrated that income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient which after social transfers fell slightly in 2019 by 0.9 points.  It also examined the impact that Covid-19 may be having on incomes and poverty using <i>ad hoc <\/i>CSO publications on the impact of Covid-19 on income poverty metrics.<\/p><p>Deputies might be interested to hear that preliminary findings on the impact of Covid-19 indicate that lower-income employees, and employees under the age of 25, appeared on average to experience an increase in their incomes in the year to Q4 of 2020, due to availing of Covid-19 supports.  That underpins the strength of the measures that Government introduced to safeguard the incomes and living standards of some of the most vulnerable to the economic damage reaped by Covid-19.  That was a fairly comprehensive study undertaken by the CSO.<\/p><p>On the homeless, the report stated that there are fewer homeless people on the street this year than last year.  A significant winter plan is being developed.  I would ask Deputy Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan to bring that case to the attention of the Minister, because that should not be the case.  There is a whole range of supports there through the homeless organisations and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to try to deal with cases like Ciara&rsquo;s.  I would be very concerned that the system did not provide a safety net for her in respect of that.<\/p><p>On income thresholds for social housing, that is currently being reviewed.  Again, I do not see why, in the case the Deputy identified, that a person who is homeless and gets work is automatically taken out of the homeless services.  That should not be the case.  There always has to be a degree of cop-on and flexibility in dealing with people within the system.  In many instances, I meet that common sense approach.  I will engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on these points that Deputy Boyd Barrett raised.<\/p><p>On the city wide drug strategy, there is an issue about existing mechanisms.  As I said previously, I would like to see an expansion of supports for area partnerships or drug task forces.  The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, is working on suggestions and proposals on that.  In addition to the funding already allocated, we would like to do more to deal with the epidemic and the challenges and pressures imposed on communities as a result of the illegal trafficking of drugs and also to bring a more health-based approach to supporting those who are addicted and those who need help.<\/p><p>In respect of the points raised by Deputy Barry, the Government introduced measures in the budget and we are constantly keeping this under review to make sure we can do everything we possibly can to alleviate the pressure on households in respect of the increase in energy pricing.  We will continue to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","time":1637682900,"counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00250"},{"type":"question","time":1637682900,"counter":152,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[52215\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the international and European Union division of his Department.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1637682900,"counter":153,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[55900\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the international and European Union division of his Department.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1637682900,"counter":154,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[55797\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the international and European Union division of his Department.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1637682900,"counter":155,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[55803\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the international and European Union division of his Department.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1637682900,"counter":156,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[56128\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300019#S00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the work of the international and European Union division of his Department.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1637682900,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union and the international division of my Department works on all aspects of European Union and international policy within my Department, including issues relating to the European Union and the United Kingdom relationship.

This is clearly an attempt to, essentially, make illegal any organisation that utters a word of criticism of Israel or shines any spotlight on its apartheid policies, its routine denial of Palestinian rights, its persecution of Palestinians or its illegal occupation of Palestinian land.  Those organisations are now designated as terrorists.  The Government has expressed concern about this.  It said it would be in touch with the Israeli authorities, as has the EU.  What is actually happening?  This is further evidence that Israel is a rogue state.  I am slightly concerned about some of the responses from the Minister and from Government spokespeople, who have started to bandy around the word \"antisemitism\" if you question the right of Israel to be an apartheid state, which it is.  That is clearly coming from the Israelis.  I remind the Taoiseach that Nelson Mandela believed Israel was an apartheid state that should be boycotted.

Trade has increased by 60% from North to South and from South to North by about 48% just in the past year.  Some unionists are fully against the protocol.  That is their right but they believe, for some reason, that a majority of unionists have to support the protocol before it can be agreed by society in the North.  That is not how democracy works and those days of unionist majoritarianism are over.  The key point for this Chamber is that treating the British gently with regard to the protocol has not worked.

No one ever likes to see politicians who would ordinarily be going about their parliamentary business and referendum activity in prison as a result of their activities.  There is an overarching constitutional framework within Spain as well that has to be resolved by Spain and by the country.  It has had its history and it has evolved.  It is important to bear that in mind and to keep that in perspective.<\/p>  <p>  As regards Deputy Barry's points, I abhor violence against women.  It is a stain on our society.  The Minister for Justice, along with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, is working on a new strategy and on resources, making sure that resources will be provided in areas that have none at the moment, such as refuges in certain counties and that there will be a timeline for the provision of such services.  That is ongoing.  I am available to support any group that needs additional facilities through the local authorities.  There have been good partnerships in Cork on the homeless issue and with regard to refuge for victims of gender-based violence.  That has been always the case, consistently over time and I have no doubt that will continue with the support of Government.  Any additionality or any requests that come to us from either the NGO sector or local authorities in partnership with the NGO sector will be positively responded to.  That has been always the case.  There has been a far greater level of awareness of this issue and that must continue.  The situation is serious and was exacerbated during the pandemic.  We know that and it has been reported.  Every effort has to be made in an integrated way across all Departments and every forum, including education, to inculcate and nurture proper respect in our schools and right throughout our society so that we can reduce and, ultimately, eliminate, violence against women.  It is shocking that it continues at the level it does.<\/p>  <p>  On the Palestinian question, I am very concerned at this designation by Israel's ministry of defence of six Palestinian NGOs, including Irish Aid and European Union partner organisations.  We partner with a number of these organisations and they have now been designated as terrorist entities.  That is wrong.  Ireland supported the holding of a discussion on the designation and on the recent settlement announcements at the UN Security Council on 8 November and we made a press statement following the meeting with France, Estonia, Norway and Albania, as an incoming UN Security Council member.  In the joint statement, we underlined our serious concerns at this designation and the potential political, legal and financial consequences.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to funding civil society organisations and human rights defenders through the Irish Aid programme, including Palestinian civil society.  We as a country have been strong supporters of Palestinian civil society through the years.  We carry out robust checks to ensure our funding is used only for the purpose intended and we have no evidence to suggest otherwise.  In the absence of any detailed evidence from the Israeli authorities to support the designations, Ireland will continue to support the organisations concerned.

Likewise, in respect of settlements, we have consistently raised our opposition to the Israeli Government's plans for more than 3,000 settlement units in the West Bank.  On 20 October we released a statement jointly with 11 other European countries urging the Israeli Government to reverse that decision and reiterating our strong opposition to its policy of settlement expansion.

The Oireachtas is currently discussing various Bills dealing with white-collar crime, one of which deals with corporate authority.  The Oireachtas is also dealing with legislation to give further powers to the Central Bank to enhance its ability to tackle white-collar crime.  It is now necessary to reform this whole area and create one State investigation authority to deal with all white-collar crime in our society.  We must build an authority that will be able to investigate this area properly.  It must be of a sufficient size and have the personnel with the requisite skills and knowledge to deal with all of these elements of society.  Reform in this area must mean that investigations are done expeditiously and not at massive cost to the State so that justice happens in real time, the people involved in wrongdoing are punished in real time and there is real-time accountability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300021#U00700","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1637684100,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I certainly agree that the commission of investigation format is not working.

I know we will be discussing this in greater depth later this evening but a number of the survivors who were outside Leinster House today are absolutely furious at the proposed redress scheme.  They are angry at arbitrary time periods and thresholds for those who were in mother and baby homes being used as some sort of meaningful guide for redress.  This is just typical of the way the State gets it so badly wrong.  People must have spent six months in an institution to be eligible for redress, as if the human story, tragedy, hardship and trauma can somehow be equated to a particular time period or amount of money.  This is an example of how the State really get things wrong.  We will debate it further this evening but I would simply say that the key in such sensitive investigations and in the production of reports is to listen to the survivors and those with first-hand experience.

In the D&aacute;il four years ago, the Taoiseach, who was then in opposition, said: &quot;In all honesty and sincerity, it is time the Oireachtas responded in the only way possible, which is the establishment of an inquiry.&quot;  The Taoiseach was correct then and I hope he will follow through on that.  The failures of the policing and justice system leading up to Shane's death and the actions thereafter, including by the courts, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice, are significant, not just to the O'Farrell family but to the general public.  This should also be of interest to the Taoiseach in his position as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il because in 2018 the Fianna F&aacute;il confidence and supply negotiating team raised Shane's case with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice who, in turn, committed to providing a briefing note.  It was recently reported by Ms Justine McCarthy in the <i>Sunday Times<\/i>that the departmental memo did not inform Fianna F&aacute;il of significant information pertaining to the driver who killed Shane.

It was not about kicking the can down the road, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n suggested.  There was a demand from this House, and I was in opposition at the time, that the Government establish an inquiry.  All in opposition wanted an inquiry into this.  The Deputy is correct that the Department has estimated that it could cost &euro;30 million but there are no precise figures.  That could be the ultimate cost but no one knows.<\/p> <p>I have been in the House for a considerable length of time.  Because of the view that people have rights and so on, all inquiries take an inordinate length of time.  To date, no one formula that I have seen has been optimal.  Parliamentary inquiries have had difficulties and have ended up in the courts where citizens have taken the Legislature to court in respect of how they were treated.  Commissions of investigation were originally brought in by Senator McDowell when he was a Minister as a means of finding a shorter route to get a more efficient outcome to inquiries because inquiries under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act were proving to be very long as well, and were taking years or even decades in some cases.  Some tribunals of inquiry took ten years or more.  Everybody is entitled to their good name and everybody is entitled to cross-examine and there are huge legal costs attached to all of these inquiries as a result of all that.  One of these inquiries was established in 2015 and the others not too long after that.  We should go in with our eyes wide open.  Very often, the first response from the Opposition and Members of this House is to set up an inquiry.  Parties are in government at different times.  That is the first resort and I am not sure if it is the correct response.<\/p> <p> In answer to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, the idea of a State investigation authority was looked at by the Law Reform Commission in 2005.  It looked at public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry.  It gave the pros and cons for what it called a permanent inquiries office.  In the end, it opted to go against setting it up.  It said the office would have a permanent team of staff experienced in investigations and paid salaries rather than a daily rate, thus resulting in savings.  The staff would have \"easy access to precedents and guidance on ... procedural issues\" and would provide a one-stop-shop for those seeking information on inquiries.  It then gave the disadvantages.  It stated: \"Although a number of public inquiries may be in existence at present, there is no guarantee that there will be a need for similar bodies in the future\".  It also stated: \"public inquiries ... are ad hoc bodies [by their nature] ... and their structure and personnel should reflect this.\"  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n might consult the report.<\/p> <p> My view is that irrespective of what form of inquiries we decide on, they will be lengthy, given our legal system and people will never be entirely satisfied with their conclusions.  It is a very challenging situation.  What we need to do is build up permanent systems.  We established the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  People are unhappy with GSOC.  It was to hold garda&iacute; to account for any misdeeds.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n spoke about white-collar crime.  The Garda should be investigating white-collar crime.  Our existing agencies should be doing this work and reducing the need for inquiries in the first instance.<\/p> <p> The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was established.

We should take these opportunities to the maximum whenever we can.<\/p>  <p>  The recently published report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, as part of its sixth assessment, sets out the most up-to-date physical science basis for our understanding of climate change.  The report confirms, among other things, that we have a limited window for real action to reduce emissions to ensure that current and future generations can live sustainably in a low-carbon and climate-resilient world.<\/p>  <p>  In line with EU ambition, the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to achieving a 51% reduction in Ireland's overall greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net-zero emissions not later than 2050.  These legally-binding objectives are set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the enactment of which was a key priority in the programme for Government. The climate Act underpins Ireland&rsquo;s transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and the achievement of a climate-neutral economy not later than 2050.  It also establishes a legally binding framework with clear targets and commitments to ensure the necessary structures and processes are in place to deliver our national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long term.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background, strategies must be devised to reduce and manage climate change risks through a combination of mitigation and adaptation responses.  It is crucial that while we prepare our carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, delivery of climate action in Ireland continues at pace.  The Climate Action Plan 2021, launched on 4 November, provides a detailed roadmap for meeting our climate ambition under the climate Act.<\/p>  <p>  The plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy.  These ranges will be finalised in the climate action plan for 2022 following the legal adoption of carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will support the changes through major public investment announced recently in the &euro;165 billion national development plan, including increased funding for retrofitting our homes, building new public transport and active mobility infrastructure, reskilling workers and supporting a just transition.<\/p>  <p>  While the Climate Action Plan 2021 builds on the ambitious targets of the 2019 plan, it represents a significant step-up in terms of ambition and implementation.  To highlight a number of the most significant measures included in the Climate Action Plan 2021, the plan commits to an increase in the proportion of renewable electricity to up to 80% by 2030, including an increased target of up to 5 GW of offshore wind energy.  It commits to a significant reduction in transport emissions by 2030.  Measures will include enabling 500,000 extra walking, cycling and public transport journeys per day by 2030, and supporting the take-up of electric vehicles to reach almost 1 million by 2030.  The plan commits to the implementation of a new national retrofit plan to increase supply capacity and make retrofitting more affordable.  It also commits that our enterprise sector will see a faster uptake of carbon-neutral heating, increased electrification of high-temperature heating and the phasing out of high global warming potential F-gases.<\/p>  <p>  The plan commits to reducing emissions associated with agriculture, which will be central to achieving our climate ambition.  It provides a pathway to reduce emissions while supporting world-class food production, through an innovation and science-based approach.  There will be a reduction in chemical nitrogen and more targeted use of fertiliser, while maintaining our position as a global leader in grass growth through multi-species swards.  Reducing emissions from land use and a move to being an overall store of carbon will involve further bog rehabilitation, increased afforestation, and the rewetting of peat organic soils.  A new forestry programme will be prepared for launch in 2023.<\/p>  <p>  This plan also places a just transition at its core.  It sets out four principles that will guide our policymaking and implementation over the coming years to ensure that we can effectively monitor and manage our transition and that our responses remain flexible so that we can respond to future transition challenges and target the areas in need of support.  Each Minister, as well as the Government as a whole, will be expected to consider these principles as we develop and implement our climate policies.<\/p> <p> We have committed in the plan to establishing a just transition commission, which will make periodic recommendations to Government, building on research, engagement through the National Dialogue on Climate Action and the annual review from the CCAC on how Government policy can further the just transition.  In delivering this ambitious climate action plan, we must ensure we bring people with us and that the transition is fair.  The recently launched National Dialogue on Climate Action will facilitate public engagement, participation, community action, networking and capacity building activities on climate action, giving everyone in society the opportunity to play their part.  Earlier this month, &euro;60 million in funding from the Climate Action Fund was announced for community climate action projects to support and empower communities to shape and build low carbon, sustainable communities in a coherent way.  The Government will shortly publish an accompanying detailed annex of actions to support the delivery of this plan.  This annex sets out the detailed actions with timelines to drive delivery and ensure our emissions reduce.<\/p> <p> I now turn to agriculture, which is responsible for 35% of our greenhouse gas emissions, predominantly methane and nitrous oxide.  Agriculture has long been a key pillar of Ireland&rsquo;s economy, especially our rural economy, and it will and should remain so into the future.  Irish agriculture has a strong reputation globally, built on our green image of clean air and clean water.  It is the same reputation that underpins our tourism industry.  We, as a country, need to maintain the green reputation through achieving the goals laid out in the climate action plan.  At the same time, we need to reverse the water quality decline caused, in part, by agricultural run-off, and this should be addressed in the nitrates action plan.  We also need to halt biodiversity loss and use the Common Agricultural Policy to ensure farmers are incentivised to provide and maintain habitats.<\/p> <p> The 2021 climate action plan focuses on reducing emissions by between 22% and 30% by 2030 from 2018 levels.  There are a number of key actions laid out in the climate action plan, which will be updated annually to take account of developments in science and policy.  First, there will be a significant focus on the reduction in chemical nitrogen fertiliser on our farms.  This reduction in fertiliser will be achieved through more targeted applications, reductions in run-off, use of nitrogen fixing plants in multi-species swards and use of low emissions slurry spreading technology, which has seen a significant uptake over the last three years.  Recent increases in international gas prices are also feeding through to increases in fertiliser prices, which strengthens the imperative to reduce fertiliser consumption.  Farmers need to be supported to do so without a loss in farm income.<\/p> <p> Use of multi-species swards, in other words, a mixture of three or more species whose growth characteristics complement each other, resulting in improved productivity compared to when each species is grown on its own, will enhance productivity with significantly less nitrogen input.  This reduces costs and allows the animals gain weight faster, reducing additional feed requirements.  It is important that this productivity gain not only results in higher farm profit, but also in improved water quality and enhanced habitat that will improve biodiversity.<\/p> <p> Ireland is at the bottom of the league table of organic farming in Europe.  We need to reverse this and we need to promote organic farming.  This will require sustained investment by the State and farmers in the transition to organic farming.  The climate action plan targets an almost five-fold increase in organic farming in Ireland.<\/p> <p> There are a number of other key actions laid out in the plan.  We need to shift the focus fundamentally to increasing farm incomes through rewarding sustainable food production, enhancing biodiversity and protecting our air, climate and water.<\/p> <p> Our homes, workplaces, public buildings and recreational facilities are responsible for 12.7% of our overall emissions, predominantly in the residential sector, not including emissions from the electricity we use in our buildings.  The poor energy performance of our building stock means that our homes produce about 60% more CO2 emissions than the European average.  There is already a vibrant retrofit industry in Ireland, with over 400,000 homes, or about one quarter of all homes, having received grants to upgrade their homes since the introduction of energy efficiency grants in 2008.  However, the activity level to date is not sufficient for our ambition.  We need to increase both the number of homes improving their energy performance and also increase the depth of retrofit that our homes must undergo.  Most people will understand the need to improve the insulation of homes to improve air leakage and to ensure our homes have adequate and controlled ventilation.<\/p> <p> We also need to focus on the switching of our solid fuel, oil and gas boilers to cleaner alternatives.  There are two main alternatives that will be used and, in outlining those alternatives, it might be worth outlining some examples of other European countries that use them.  In Scandinavia, as a response to the 1970s oil crisis, Norway, Sweden and Denmark set out to install district heating systems that used waste heat from power plants and other industrial facilities to provide heat to homes.  This works by installing highly insulated piping to every home in a city and metering the heat, much like electricity, and charging users for the heat on a monthly basis.  Approximately 50% of Danish heat is supplied in this way.  The target in our climate action plan is to have district heating, from plants like the waste-to-energy facility in Poolbeg, to provide between 5% and 10% of our heat by 2030.<\/p> <p> For homes in areas of lower density, rural and suburban homes will switch from fossil fuel to heat pumps, predominantly air-source heat pumps.  Almost all new-build homes last year installed heat pumps as their heating systems.  In Norway, 60% of homes are heated by heat pumps and about 43% in Sweden.  In Ireland, we will use our vast wind energy to provide zero-carbon electricity for heat pumps in our buildings.  A well installed heat pump can provide four units of energy, drawn from the energy in the air, to each one unit of electricity required to power the heat pump.  The climate action plan seeks to install 600,000 heat pumps in Irish homes by 2030, with 400,000 in existing homes.<\/p> <p> The national retrofit plan, published as part of the climate action plan, will support homeowners to retrofit their homes.  We will be qualifying a number of one-stop-shops for retrofit that can support homeowners on this journey and organise the contractor, grants, advice and low-cost finance.  The vision underpinning the national retrofit plan is that it should be as easy to retrofit a house as it currently is to buy a car, with a small up-front deposit and a low-cost loan that will predominantly be funded by the savings on energy bills.  The Government has, in the national development plan and the climate action plan, outlined the very significant Exchequer resources available to retrofit homes out to 2030, funded in part by carbon taxation.  The provision of zero-carbon, low-cost heat to our homes is one of the most important climate interventions the Government is making, delivering a range of benefits, including improved public health and air quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300022#V00700","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637685300,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the urgency needed to tackle climate change, we back our national greenhouse emissions target and we worked constructively throughout the extensive consideration of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill.  It is worth saying that unlike some in government who argued against interim targets, for example, now deemed an essential element of the plan, Sinn F&eacute;in argued for them.  We agree on the need to act now and on our overall targets.  In that respect, there is much we agree with in principle and practice in the climate action plan.  We agree but we wonder why the Government lacks ambition and impetus, why it acts so slowly and, worse, why it acts contrary to the stated position.  Elsewhere, this climate action plan is devoid of credibility, in particular when it comes to financing &euro;125 billion in private finance, which has to come from somewhere, and related delivery.  There is no shortage of plans and this needs to be not just another one.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to push for a just transition.  This is something that, in the first instance, must be delivered for communities in the midlands, who have been listening to promises for a long time.  Just transition must be extended beyond the midlands to all communities and all sectors.  For some, the transition between a high and a low carbon economy is the difference between a new petrol Land Rover or a new Tesla, or a switch to public transport.  For others, it is a matter of being able to heat their home, feed themselves and their family or having a job to go to in the morning.  Just transition needs to move beyond rhetoric and I do not see that in the climate action plan.  I do not believe the Government has done enough to show communities and sectors that a just transition is on the cards.  It has not set out a vision for just transition in this climate action plan.<\/p>  <p>  On energy, I welcome the new commitment in the plan to increase our target on renewable energy to 80% of our needs by 2030.  Ireland is blessed with massive potential for offshore wind but, unfortunately, decades of under-ambition and painfully slow regulatory development have suffocated the exploitation of this vital natural resource.  Almost 20 years on from its construction, Arklow Bank phase 1 remains Ireland's only offshore wind farm, with an output of just 25 MW.<\/p> <p>That is a damning indictment.  Even now, on the brink of 2022, we still do not have a legislative framework in place for offshore wind generation.  The industry representative body, Wind Energy Ireland, has warned that we have a narrowing window to meet the 2030 target and that was before it was increased to 80%.  It highlights various areas that need to be addressed by government, including fixing the foreshore licensing system; providing more resources to relevant agencies; progressing renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions and the maritime area planning Bill; establishing an offshore grid steering committee; strengthening our electricity grid; and developing specific ports to ensure offshore wind farms can be built from our island.<br\/><br\/>The lack of action is already having consequences.  Equinor pulled out of Ireland, citing the regulatory processes as one aspect of its decision for doing so.  The Government did not bat an eyelid in response.  This is a raging red alarm.  Similarly, the guidelines for offshore wind are 15 years old.  This has led to bad planning and animosity between some developers and rural communities.  If the number of parliamentary questions and council motions being put forward by Government party representatives is anything to go by, I can say that it is accepted across the political spectrum that the guidelines are out of date and in desperate need of updating.<br\/><br\/>Meanwhile, the Government dithers and the same can be said about microgeneration.  Communities have their hands up willing and wanting to play their part and the Government slaps them down.  Similarly, hydrogen can play a key role in our energy transition.  It could potentially provide a solution for some of the heavy industries and sectors where battery power is not feasible.  Excess wind energy can be used to run electrolysers to produce green hydrogen.  The fact that it can be stored and transported makes it particularly attractive to fill gaps in energy production when the wind does not blow, for example.  Despite this, Ireland is one of only two European countries that does not have a hydrogen strategy in place.  I cannot understand this.  Is it a lack of capacity, expertise or ambition?  I do not know what it is but something is lacking.  The climate action plan fails to take hydrogen seriously.  This is a mistake and one I would ask the Minister to act upon.<br\/><br\/>The MaREI institute has developed the TIMES-Ireland model to map out paths to 51% renewable energy generation by 2030, net zero by 2050 and beyond to 2070.  It shows that it can be achieved, which is positive, and that the most efficient way to do it is to reduce demand.  This is referred to as the low demand scenario.  Then I think about Government Deputies cheerleading for data centres while the Government heaps carbon tax increases onto people who have no alternatives and no public transport, electric vehicles, EVs, heat pumps or retrofitted homes.  We know that a significant majority of households use kerosene or solid fuels to heat their homes on these cold winter nights yet the Government rolls out the red carpet for data centres, which hoover up enormous amounts of energy.  At the weekend, we read in the <i>Business Post<\/i>that when Google said &quot;Jump&quot; Enda Kenny said &quot;How high?&quot;.  Why would we expect anything different from Facebook or Amazon?<br\/><br\/>I have been consistently putting forward ideas to kick-start emission reductions in the transport sector.  School bus transport is significantly oversubscribed year on year but the current target outlined in Bus &Eacute;ireann's sustainability strategy would only see a 20% increases in bus places by 2030.  That is the equivalent of just 1,000 extra places each year.  We are turning thousands of children away from public transport each year and putting them back in private cars, which makes no sense at all.  Public transport fares are a huge barrier for many people and we are not seeing the ambition needed to reduce costs for people to encourage them to take the bus, train or tram, nor are we seeing the ambition to develop long overdue public transport infrastructure.  Some mega projects continue to be delayed and some have been deferred into oblivion.  Connecting Ireland is welcome and I do what the Opposition is supposed to do when we welcome a proposition.  We encourage our constituents to engage with it and my constituents are ready to avail of the services.  The difficulty is they will have to wait because funding is backloaded, with just 10% of funding allocated in year one and no guarantee of future funding.<br\/><br\/>This plan needs to be delivered on.  The objectives of delivering on the emissions reductions are of deep and legitimate concern.  We do not see a credible plan to get us there, bring communities with us and achieve those targets.  The Minister of State needs to listen to the Opposition, communities and different sectors.  They want to play their part but they need to be enabled to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300023#W00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637685900,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate.  The rate of global warming has to be halted and there is no arguing about that.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see that happen quickly.  Everyone has a role to play but it has to be led by the State.  However, the Government's plan does not stack up.  In July 2019, I moved a Private Members' motion on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in which sought to bind future Governments to reject the EU-Mercosur deal on free trade.  We know the implications of that deal.  It would see the Amazon rainforest depleted and destroyed for the sake of selling German cars to South America.  The Government must respect that motion and I call on the Green Party Deputies here to ensure the intention express in that vote in July 2019 is upheld.<\/p>  <p>  Forestry is key.  We have had an unresolved crisis in our domestic forestry industry for over two years.  In County Laois, for example, over 400 ha per annum were being planted.  This figure collapsed to 26 ha per annum in 2020.  Workers and farmers, not just in Laois, Offaly and other counties but right across the country, have lost confidence in the forestry sector due to the backlog in the licensing system.  For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing to overhaul the licensing system and have a streamlined process all the way through for planting, thinning and felling.  There are also all-party recommendations from the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to that effect.<\/p>  <p>  There is no clear plan from the Government on sustainable farming.  Just over 1.5% of farming in Ireland is organic.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said this would be increased fivefold but that would only be 7.5%, whereas the EU target is 25%.  We need more leadership from government to support family farms to move to organic farming, forestry and renewable energy.  Our vision for climate action is based on helping families and communities to make that transition to the green economy and create green jobs.  We want to provide public transport links between small towns.  Some small steps have been taken in that regard but we need to move on with that work.  I have put forward suggestions on doing so, as have other Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to invest in State bodies like Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB to develop biogas, biomass, hydrogen, wind and solar power.  Bord na M&oacute;na has to be central to this.  That is important because it has the land mass and resources.  It can be the energy solution company and it must be to the front in these efforts.  I ask the Government to focus less on punishing ordinary people through increasing carbon taxes and focus more on how we can meet our climate targets through providing alternatives for workers and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300024#X00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1637685900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>We all recognise the urgent need to reduce emissions but our children and future generations will not thank us for what is emerging, namely, this negotiating and lobbying battleground that sees urban and rural dwellers pitted against each other.  They will also not thank us for the urban-rural dweller narrative that is being created by the refusal of the Government to see the disproportionate impact that its view of climate action will have.  Rural dwellers, with their solid fuel fires and diesel cars, are being pitted against urban dwellers with access to public transport and alternative heating options.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that all change matters but when local economies are affected, be they in Ballymore or Bali, statistically it is the working poor who pay the highest price and are disproportionately affected by the negative effects of climate change.  Across the midlands, there is little evidence on the ground that just transition is approaching anything that could be described as \"just\", not when we see beef deals that will hasten the demise of rainforests but support beef barons.  We also see a retrofit programme and an electric car scheme that are untenable for so many of my constituents.  If environmental policies are to succeed, they must be underpinned by equality and justice and tackle the economic model which concentrates power and wealth in the hands of a few.<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight one specific sector, namely, public transport.  Every year, the school transport scheme is substantially oversubscribed.  Sinn F&eacute;in demonstrated how we could have a scheme that would remove tens of thousands of car journeys from our roads each day, helping to reduce carbon emissions.  When something makes sense for the climate and reduces the burdens on families but also makes sense fiscally but is still not being done, that is when frustration grows and the Government loses the support of people.<\/p> <p>For example, in August, in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, our bus service was slashed.

This is equally the position for family farmers and rural communities, which are facing considerable challenges.<\/p>  <p>  There have been virtually no new supports brought forward by the Government to help farming families meet rising environmental obligations and many of these obligations are also counterproductive in terms of climate action.  For example, it is ludicrous that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine intends to restrict suckler herd sizes while, at the same time, the Government continues to support the EU-Mercosur trade deal, which would see an additional 99,000 tonnes of less sustainable beef flooding the EU market.  This will only hasten the demise of the Amazon and contradicts the recent COP26 leaders' declaration to halt deforestation by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to forestry here in Ireland, afforestation can play an important role in meeting our emission targets.  However, the Government is not doing enough to foster this sector.  It needs to redirect resources within the Department to resolve the current licensing backlog.  Delays in granting licences are forcing the importation of timber while Irish trees cannot be planted or felled.  As well as acting as a disincentive to farmers and landowners to enter afforestation, this is threatening 12,000 jobs in the forestry industry.  A new forestry strategy is needed that promotes the planting of native broadleaf forestry and incentivises new farmers and landowners to enter afforestation.<\/p>  <p>  Another ludicrous aspect of the Government's climate action plan is the situation whereby thousands of tonnes of peat are being shipped across a continent to Ireland from Latvia.  This does not make environmental, economic or ethical sense.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than lecture farmers and rural communities about climate action and penalise them through carbon taxes and counterproductive policies, Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a number of measures that would help family farmers to play a positive role in reducing emissions and making necessary changes.

It is timely, following the conclusion of COP26.  Although many of us might have mixed feelings about what was agreed on COP26, undoubtedly some progress was made, albeit not, perhaps, as much as we would have liked.  Certainly, the onus is now on countries such as our own to deliver on the climate commitments made.<\/p>  <p>  I welcomed the recent publication of the Government's climate action plan which, as Members are aware, sets out 475 separate actions leading to the necessary emissions reductions that we have committed to, in other words, to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  It includes provision for extensive offshore wind power, the retrofitting of 500,000 homes and other targets, such as the putting of 1 million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030.  These were ambitious but necessary targets which my party very much welcomed.  Without sight of the detailed annexe, however, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smith, referred and which apparently will be published shortly to support delivery of the plan, it is difficult to see how we can achieve those targets and what steps are to be taken.  I am mindful of the Climate Change Advisory Council's clear recommendation that it is in the next two to three years that we need to see the necessary investment to develop the infrastructure, around, for example, offshore wind generation and electric vehicle, EV, charging that will help us deliver on those more ambitious yearly reductions targets that we have set ourselves for the latter half of this decade up to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  There are huge questions as to how we can meet the targets, as to what are the steps that will be taken and whether Government is serious about meeting those targets.  This is causing immense frustration among all of us affected: householders who are looking to do retrofitting, farmers who are not clear on agriculture targets and those who are still awaiting decent active and public transport infrastructure.  Indeed, in my own area, in Dublin Bay South, there is huge frustration at the delays built into the BusConnects and the National Transport Authority plans.  That frustration is felt across Dublin but, certainly, in Dublin Bay South, I am communicated with daily by constituents who are looking to do the right thing, who want to move to active travel and who want, if they have a car, to switch to an EV.  Motorists are stymied unless they are lucky enough to have a driveway.  There are many areas, such as my own in Portobello, where most households do not have driveways, where most parking is on-street parking and where there are simply not enough publicly accessible EV chargers to make it feasible or practical for many people to switch to EVs.  I am frustrated by trying to ensure that we see the greater provision of EV chargers in publicly accessible areas across Dublin Bay South and I can see the frustration experienced by many who want to do the right thing but have simply not been given a clear pathway to do so through the lack of development of the infrastructure.  It is difficult to see how we will meet that target in transport, for example, of putting 1 million EVs on Irish roads, or, indeed, meeting our targets of significantly fewer journeys by car, if we do not build and put in the infrastructure.  I will not even start on the difficulties of getting pedestrian crossings and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians in my area.  There is frustration there.<\/p>  <p>  I note, in his speech, the Minister of State talked about retrofitting.  There are frustrating delays here where the Minister of State noted \"the activity level to date is not sufficient for our ambition\".  That sums up, unfortunately, a real lack of urgency and really serious delays that have been built into our processes.  We need to address those as a matter of urgency because we need to see that sort of urgent and radical response driving governments around the world when it comes to climate change.  The Taoiseach himself acknowledged this in his address to COP26 when he stated that \"every second of delay\" makes the task to cut emissions \"that bit bigger\".  Of course, the Taoiseach is right.  The crisis is cumulative and when we wait to take action, as we all know, the problem gets worse.  Unfortunately, we have seen these substantial and significant delays built in.  It means then that there is a lack of clarity about how we meet those targets.  As I said, we urgently need the investment in the infrastructure now.<\/p>  <p>  We saw delays in the publication of the climate action plan itself and I have addressed those in previous debates in this House.  It was disappointing, for example, that it was not aligned with the fiscal budget, as had been initially promised.  As we know, we are well into the key decade in which we have to put in place the infrastructure to reduce our emissions by half by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to putting those measures in place, we also need to see - maybe this will be in the annexe - what are the vital redistributive measures that will deliver the just transition that will bring the public with us and that will ensure that those who might be adversely affected by necessary measures will be given the necessary supports.  That is what we mean by just transition.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen through the pandemic the value of State intervention, public service and collective solidarity.  That sense of the importance of public services and of the public sector has been reflected in recent election results where we have seen parties of the left winning in Germany, Norway and elsewhere with a growing consciousness of the need for that strong collective solidarity to also weigh in behind our response to climate change.  It is through that sort of solidarity, through the empowerment of ordinary people and through effective and clear communication that we will bring society with us on meeting those targets and then we will all reap the benefits of a world in which a better society is possible, with cleaner air, warmer homes, better infrastructure and support for biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  Labour is willing to play a constructive role.  Indeed, we are doing that in opposition.  I put forward, as the Minister of State will be aware, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (Carbon Footprint Labelling) Bill 2021 and I was glad the Government did not oppose that.  I am also putting forward a Bill on Dublin Bay to try to introduce a statutory authority for Dublin Bay to improve the governance of Dublin Bay to ensure that we do not see the sort of developments we saw this week with algae growing across the water and real concerns among sea swimmers and others who use the wonderful amenity, as I and so many of us do, that there is not any proper or adequate monitoring of water quality in Dublin Bay.  It is that sort of initiative that we propose to take.  We will also be introducing a right to repair Bill with measures to stop waste and to tackle the cost of living by requiring manufacturers of digital electronic equipment to make available repair information to consumers.  We want to work with the Minister of State in a range of ways to ensure that we meet those ambitious but necessary climate targets and to ensure that we achieve that just transition that is also so crucial.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300025#Y00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1637687100,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with my Government colleague, Deputy O'Dowd.  I wish to acknowledge my fellow spokespeople on climate, Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke from Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Bacik from Labour.  I believe both Deputies to be genuinely committed to the issue of climate.  Having listened to them, some of their criticism and their takes on the climate action plan are valid and legitimate.  We welcome that kind of opposition.  Some of the criticism is not valid or legitimate.  To use Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s words, I would say that we should move beyond rhetoric.  That is something that should apply to all parties in the House, as well as the Government.  I am thankful that we have a baseline of agreement about climate action among most parties in this House.  It makes what feels like an impossible job to halve our emissions in less than a decade slightly more achievable.  However, I think we really need to up our game, all of us, including the Ministers responsible.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome many elements of the 2021 climate action plan but I think the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will acknowledge that it is not enough.  We have a series of ranges of emissions reductions for each sector and we have to convert those ranges into definite, single numbers for each sector that will be compatible with the carbon budgets.  We are getting to the stage where further delay is inaction.<\/p>  <p>  We are still at the stage where we have unallocated emissions reductions, comprising 4 megatonnes overall in the climate action plan, as well as an additional 0.9 megatonnes in transport.  We urgently need to start discussing where those additional emissions reductions are going to come from.  We need to stop talking about more roads and multibillion euro motorways and over-intensification in agriculture.<\/p>  <p>  One challenge is significant institutional inertia in the big emitting sectors, and business-as-usual thinking is still too dominant.  I remind the House that section 17 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 specifically obliges public bodies, insofar as practicable, to perform their functions in a manner consistent with a number of criteria including the most recent approved climate action plan, the furtherance of the national climate objective and the general objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and climate change adaptation.  I will be honest here and say that I do not think many of our public bodies are acting consistently with the climate Act.  In transport we are still talking about new roads for electric cars and electric buses instead of reducing vehicle kilometres and, as Deputy Bacik just said, fewer journeys.  We are not talking enough about reallocating road space and achieving modal shift.  In agriculture we are still on a pathway that involves the export of commodity products.<\/p>  <p>  I am making these criticisms here and I accept some of them are uncomfortable but I also wish there were more making these criticisms with me, both inside and outside the House.  It is not sufficient to say we are not doing enough.  We need to describe exactly how we are not doing enough and to suggest measures that will bridge the gap.  I call on Opposition parties and on environmental civil society groups to put the pressure on and start talking in specifics.<\/p>  <p>  We need to stop ignoring the phenomenon of induced demand and accept that more roads bring more traffic volumes that bring more emissions even with 1 million electric vehicles on our roads by 2030.  We have failed to quantify induced demand and we need to quantify induced demand and stop pretending it does not exist.  We need to accept it politically but also officially.  We need to get better advice.  For example, the five cities traffic demand management report commissioned by the Department of Transport completely ignored road space reallocation and circulation plans, measures that have proven to reduce transport emissions in other countries.  There is significant expertise in consulting firms on emissions reduction in transport and I see this expertise in Scotland and in Wales but not in Ireland.  We need better advice and we need it urgently.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look again at the emissions in the agriculture sector.  We have to accept that technical changes to the ways that we spread slurry, genomics, feed additives and other business-as-usual measures will only get us so far.  We have applied for another derogation from the nitrates directive for 7,000 out of 137,000 farms in Ireland, despite the fact that the water in 43% of our rivers is still of unsatisfactory quality and according to the EPA, agriculture is the primary contributor to this unsatisfactory quality.  As far as I am aware, we still do not know what the emissions impact of continuing with the nitrates derogation will be.<\/p>  <p>  I have addressed transport and agriculture but we also need urgent specific discussion on the other sectors.  We have a few short months to make some very difficult decisions.  We can talk about bringing people with us on the journey but if we are not prepared to make the journey in the first place, then that talk is pretty useless.<\/p>  <p>  While I do commend the 2021 climate action plan, which contains many good measures, it is also not enough.  We only have a few months to make the difficult decisions for the statutory 2022 plan.  It is time we all got to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300026#Z00100","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1637687100,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I welcome this debate and the Minister of State.  I will concentrate on air quality and related issues and the future of all our health.  The Environmental Protection Agency tells us that since the regulations controlling air pollution were introduced in 2015, some 1,300 people die annually as a direct result of solid fuel emissions from home heating and fires.  One problem is that there is no enforcement of those regulations.  The regulators are the local authorities.  I reckon about 9,100 people have died as a direct result of air pollution from fossil fuels since 2015.  The number of prosecutions in 2015 was two, in 2016 it was two, in 2017 there were none, in 2018 there was one, in 2019 there was one.  Those are the only figures we have now.  There is a great need for really fierce enforcement of these regulations.  It is entirely unacceptable that local authorities huff and puff and do nothing about these deaths in our communities.  It goes further.  Much of this solid fuel is coming into the South from across the Border.  We need a major clampdown of cross-Border sale of solid fuels on online platforms to protect our health and avoid illegal advertising.  Suppliers are advertising solid fuels that may not comply with regulations due to be introduced here as part of our climate change policy.  I looked online and found many examples of the abuse of solid fuel regulations and VAT and carbon tax avoidance.  It is appalling.  These are in nationally known publications such as the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>, <i>adverts.ie<\/i>, DoneDeal and so on.  There are companies supplying and guaranteeing delivery anywhere in Ireland of Colombian coal at &euro;360 a tonne.  First, that breaches the regulations on smoky fuel in urban areas but second, it cannot possibly be delivered at &euro;360 a tonne unless those selling it are avoiding carbon tax.  Carbon tax is clearly being avoided and our health is being destroyed in many areas by this illegal and unacceptable importation.<\/p><p>What power does Revenue have on this?  Sadly it has no power to stop any cross-Border transport or movement of goods such as coal, according to a response to a parliamentary question.  It cannot stop it because obviously there has to be free movement of goods.  Solid fuel carbon tax payments are collected on self-assessment.  No one is stopping these guys crossing the Border to check if people are paying their tax, the sort of coal they are delivering and where they are delivering to or to see if they are breaking any regulations.  I have evidence that smoky bituminous coal is being delivered, unchallenged and unregulated, by Northern Ireland couriers into homes in smokeless zones in the South.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  It is unregulated and no one is doing anything about it.  We are turning a blind eye.  It goes back to the Deputy's point.  What the hell are we doing?  Let us get real and save lives; let us improve our air quality.  All this is causing very serious harm.  The Minister will be aware that the programme for Government supports a much more aggressive, regional approach, working with Revenue and other agencies to make sure that this stops.  But it ain't stopping now.  If anyone cares to write to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to ask what it is doing about the false and misleading advertising of solid fuel in the South, he or she will learn that it is doing nothing.  It is still considering the matter.  I complained in August 2021 and still await an outcome.  It does suggest to the complainant that maybe the complainant could go to the Circuit Court or High Court for an order to prohibit these guys from doing what they are doing, which is breaking the law left, right and centre, all around our country.<\/p> <p>That is not good enough from the State agencies and is not acceptable.<\/p> <p> In summary, if we really mean to make changes and we really are about our business, then we must ensure the air we breathe is safe and fit for purpose.  The fact is all the air sampling points in this country fail the WHO requirements on air pollution.  We do not meet any of the WHO standards.  One may ask why.  It is because our European standards are brought in by the coal-producing countries that influence the EU.  It is not good enough.  We need new standards.  We need them now.  We should insist on the World Health Organization standards, which are 50% more rigorous than the present maximums we allow.  We should change to those air quality standards and be significantly more aggressive in our approach to safeguarding our lives and the quality of air we breathe in all our homes.  It is time for action.  I agree with Deputy Leddin.  As a Government and as an Opposition it is time we demand that change.  The time has come for it.  Let us not delay any longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300026#Z00200","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637687700,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I was thinking earlier about this notion of moving from rhetoric to real policies.  We all agree that is what we need to do.  I remember being here for a debate on microgeneration, which I think was in 2016 during my first year in the D&aacute;il.  It was about people putting solar panels on the roofs of their homes, farmers putting them on the roofs of their sheds, selling it back to the grid and all the benefits of that.  Everyone agreed.  Five years later, we are still talking about it.  That is the reality of it, especially for people in the farming community.<\/p>  <p>  Last Friday I was with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine up at Shass Mountain in County Leitrim.  If you want the idyllic type of farming, that is where it is.  It is low-impact farming.  You are talking about a few sheep on the side of a mountain.  It is nature flourishing at its best.  Despite this, those farmers feel under pressure.  They feel nobody is on their side.  They feel the Government is only there to beat them up and accuse them of doing the wrong thing all the time.  When they talk about forestry, the only forestry they see around them is where land was bought out from under them by big corporate interests.  Years ago the Government gave a higher grant to the farmer.  It took that away and now gives the same grant to those same corporate interests.  As such, this is going in reverse for the people on the ground who are dealing with the real issues.  I agree we need to move away from rhetoric and into green policies.  We need to have those policies implemented.  We need to not be just talking about it.<\/p>  <p>  Five years ago, we discussed the issues of selling power back into the grid.  We should have had it done four years ago.  It should not take five or six years to set a rate to allow a farmer with a large shed to put solar panels on its roof and make it so he or she does not need planning permission for that because he or she already has permission for the shed.  Why put people through all these hoops?  I am not particularly blaming the elected Government but why do the agencies of Government always seem to want to find a reason to delay and procrastinate on all these issues?  That is the big problem.  The Minister of State and the other Ministers in government need to face that down.  They must say that if they are to deliver on climate change, we must deliver solutions for people.  They must ensure people feel they are going to get something that will be there for them and that they are going to be supported through it.  People talk about a just transition but the vast majority of people in large areas of rural Ireland want an affordable transition whereby they can afford to buy into this, because at present they cannot.  These people decide they want to retrofit their home, put solar panels on their roof and insulate it properly.  They see there is a bit of a grant there for it but that they need another &euro;25,000 along with that.  Where are they going to get that?  No bank is going to give it to them because they already have a mortgage and they already have got all the other things they need to manage in life, and they are struggling.  What really need here is for the Government to be on people's side if we are going to deliver an affordable and just transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300027#AA00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1637687700,"counter":192,"content":"<p>My biggest concern with the climate action plan is the place within it for the just transition and what I considered to be a lukewarm commitment to it.  The transition to carbon neutrality must be achievable and affordable across the whole of society and not just for the select few.  As I state consistently at the climate committee, it would be damaging to social cohesion and democracy itself if we were to have a two-speed State where the privileged inhabit a world of heat pumps, solar panels and EVs while the less well-off are left out in the cold and in the bitter cold of their homes.  I tell anyone who is listening that Sinn F&eacute;in simply is not going to put up with that.  I call upon the Green Party to back us up in that regard too.<\/p><p>I am also anxious we avoid siloed thinking and silver bullets.  As we have seen with Covid where the vaccine alone is not a single solution, EVs, offsets and aspiration are no cure for the climate crisis.  When it comes to EVs we must take due account of the social and cultural damage they are doing to communities far away from Ireland.  Some are living in virtual slavery for the production of parts for what is being presented as this new green technology.  We cannot expect exploitative, capitalist corporations to oversee human rights abuses.<\/p><p>I would also like to see a major input and action from the sort of organic farmers who appeared before us at the climate committee a few weeks ago.  As I said to them on the day, if climate action was up to them, we would be halfway there.  There are farmers, and plenty of them, who have a major commitment to biodiversity and working in harmony with the land as opposed to exploiting it for profit, as seems to be the intention of some farming lobbyists.  These lobbyists remain extremely powerful.  In our alternative budget, Sinn F&eacute;in provided for three times the investment in organic farming when compared with the budget introduced by the Government.  That should be looked at again.  Incentivising all who work on the land to protect and conserve must take precedence over the <i>carte blanche<\/i>to exploit and profiteer.  We must remember that as a human species, and a very arrogant one at that, we are part of nature and not above it or separate from it.  At present we are acting like total parasites and Mother Nature does not take prisoners.<\/p><p>I do not see any recognition or wisdom in the plan for the radically-changed times ahead, as we tackle this existential crisis.  I have further concerns that it leaves too much to the individual and his or her responsibility and does not put enough pressure on corporates.

As the Minister of State said, it is very welcome we have opportunities like this to have these discussions.  I welcome also the intention from the Government side and the talk of urgency, ambition and the need to actually get moving.  I appreciate the comments from Deputy Leddin and look forward to working with him on the committee to ensure we put meat around those comments.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the climate action plan is ambitious.  The difficulty with it is whether it is achievable and whether it is going to be achievable by the Government.  In order for us to determine whether that is the case, we need to look at past delivery on targets set down by the Government and how it is doing on achieving those.  I am not looking back to previous Governments.  I am talking about commitments that have been made by the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the current D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Retrofitting is one of the key elements of the climate action plan.  There is a commitment to have 500,000 homes retrofitted by 2030.  One of the key constraints on delivering that is the construction workers and the people to do it.  I recently retrofitted my home and it was very difficult to get people to come on site to do that work and that is going to be an issue for anyone looking to get that work done.  The fact is there is no specific retrofitting apprenticeship scheme in the country at the moment, despite all the rhetoric we hear about the need for one.  In December 2020, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, said that within three months, there would be four retrofitting centres of excellence delivered across the country.  That sounded fantastic and made for great press.  Unfortunately, as only one has been delivered, that is a commitment that has not come to pass.  On 18 February the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, launched the energy efficiency retrofitting programme.  That targeted 2,400 social homes with retrofitting upgrades.  To date, 1,099 homes have been completed across five counties, so there is a big deficit there.<\/p> <p>In 2020, he announced the midlands retrofitting programme where 750 units were to be retrofitted.  To date, only 100 units have been retrofitted.  The average time between application for a warmer homes grant and completion of the upgrade is 26 months, but that average hides a postcode lottery when it comes to getting these grants.  In my home county of Wicklow, there is a two-and-a-half-year wait for a surveyor.<\/p> <p>Electric vehicles are, again, another key tenet of the climate action plan.  In August 2019, the Minister announced the roll-out of 1,000 public charging points.  Since that time, only two councils have implemented that measure and just 29 out of 1,000 charging points have been installed.  Last year, the percentage of State vehicles that were electric was 1.12%.  This year it is 1.5%.  It has not even gone up by a percentage point, despite more than 4,000 extra cars being registered by the State in that period.  <\/p> <p> It is clear that while the ambition may be high, the delivery is not.  Alarm bells are ringing very loudly for me when it comes to this delivery.  When I mentioned it previously to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, he said that we are in the middle of the Covid pandemic.  I acknowledge that will slow things down but in instances where there can be no Covid excuse, such as the percentage of State vehicles that are electric, why is the State not purchasing electric vehicles at present?  That is not a Covid-related issue.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the retrofitting of housing stock, how come some councils could carry this out during the Covid pandemic and some could not?  It was possible because some councils did it.  We have to recognise that we do not know when we will be out of Covid.  We are in the middle of a climate and biodiversity crisis now.  We, and the Government, will have to work out a way to meet these targets, regardless of what is happening in our health system.  The Government will have to speed things up, implement measures properly and ensure delivery is there because it is has not been there to date.<\/p> <p> I also want to talk about the level of spin we have seen in recent times.  I was very disappointed with the discussion of the climate action plan and how it was a &euro;125 billion programme.  It gave the impression the Government was going to invest &euro;125 billion to enable all communities to get involved in climate action when that was, in fact, private money.  It was rather unfortunate the Government gave that impression because it made the climate action plan seem much more feasible than it actually is.  <\/p> <p> I have repeatedly heard Government Deputies talk about how the carbon tax is ring-fenced and directed towards climate actions.  That is not the case.  It is just the increases in the carbon tax that are ring-fenced.  Government Deputies either know that or they do not.  If they do not know that, I ask the Minister of State to explain it because it again gives the wrong message.  The majority of the carbon tax does not go back into climate action.  I have seen Ministers who think that is the case.   This is a matter the Government needs to get clear.  The Social Democrats agree with and support the carbon tax but we want to see it ring-fenced so every person in our community can afford to make the climate action changes we will require of them.<\/p> <p> I would have liked more time.

Normally, transformative change of the sort we are undertaking is created by some disruptive technology that sweeps everything before it.  What is unique about this crisis is that we have to make this transformative change by an act of human or political will.  That challenges us all because the task of politicians is to resolve conflict.  It is a test of the Opposition as much as Government parties because this is a task for a generation.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen other parties come to the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and demand more and more ambition yet, when it comes to looking at any of the tools necessary to deliver that ambition, they shy away.  They do not want to see carbon pricing, for example.  They do not want to see that people will have to make changes in their lives and want everything to be done by big oil or big business.  They present that as just transition but that is not what it is about.  Just transition is about helping people to make the change in their lives that is needed.  There is a basic dishonesty in trying to pretend that there will not need to be change in our lives.  There will have to be.<\/p>  <p>  I have great respect for Deputy Martin Kenny but suggesting that microgeneration on the roofs of farms will solve the contribution of farming is simply not realism.  We all have to talk about this in much more committed terms rather than finding a little political nook to wriggle off the hook of this issue and point the finger at the Minister of State, who is trying to make this happen.  We all need to make this happen over the next 30 years.  We all aspire to be in government over that period so we have a vested interest in all of us making this work.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is more reliant than anyone else on making these changes occur.  We are one of the biggest carbon emitters in the world.  We are higher than the rest of Europe in virtually everything, including transport, heating and agriculture.  We are higher than them all.  We are also one of the most export-oriented countries in Europe so there is a major obligation on us to be an early mover.  Our enterprises depend on being able to sell into a market where tastes will change and people will demand environmental sustainability.  We want to be in those high-margin premium markets so the onus is on our enterprises to make those changes early, but it cannot be penal.  I see some people pretending that we must punish the ICT or farming sectors.  That is not the way to get this done.  We must work with both those sectors because they are part of our strongest export-oriented sectors.  It is vital to the continued growth of rural and urban Ireland to see those sectors continue to be strong.  We need to find solutions and work with those sectors to fix the problems they face.<\/p>  <p>  The key is that the enterprises that make those changes early will be the profitable ones.  If you talk to people who are engaged in smart farming, promoted by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, they will show they are already cutting their costs by &euro;6,000 by adopting some of the measures in the plan.  Those of us who want to see a prosperous and thriving rural Ireland have to recognise it will be built on the infrastructures and practices of the future, not those of the past.

Ireland has been part of this explosion in increasing CO2 levels on the planet.  We have all seen the results of climate change in our use of fire, especially in our use of the internal combustion engine and the burning of fossil fuels to create energy to power our homes and industrial production. <\/p> <p> As for water, we are all aware of increased sea levels; more frequent flooding of our towns and homes; more violent climatic storms; and pollution of our drinking water, along with the quality of water in our rivers and seas.  Over the past five years, Ireland has experienced its wettest winter and hottest summer on record.  We had the stormiest winter in 147 years and our first taste of a near-intact Atlantic hurricane.  We are now examining and constructing nearly 100 flood protection projects throughout the country to protect our towns and cities from these climatic events.<\/p> <p> The past ten years in Ireland have been the wettest ten years in the last 300 years, with average rainfall rising from 912 mm in 1971 to 1,224 mm in 2018.

To put it simply, we need to reverse the increased carbon we created over the past 70 years in the next 30 years, before 2050.  To correct this and to put us back on the best path to restoring our climate, the scientists have set out many strategies for us as a world community to take.

It commits us to creating thousands of jobs in the green economy, by investing in areas such as offshore wind, forestry and cutting-edge agriculture.<\/p> <p> I am proud to say County Clare is already planning to play a major role in providing offshore wind energy, with two major projects planned off the coast of the county, one by ESB International in its Green Atlantic project and the other is by Simply Blue Group in partnership with Shell.  The ESB project is also planning a facility for the production of green hydrogen fuel, with a view to exporting the fuel from the deep water berth at the Moneypoint facility in the Shannon Estuary.  The development of these projects should provide more power than the output of the coal-burning Moneypoint station, which was once producing 45% of Ireland's electricity requirements.<\/p> <p> This is a good example of how County Clare is making a major contribution in transforming from the old technology to the new green economy and the opportunities it can bring to all of us.  This plan tells us that all citizens, communities and business will have a role to play.  Government will support the changes through the &euro;165 billion national development plan, which includes funding for retrofitting our homes, building new public transport, reskilling workers and supporting a just transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300028#BB00500","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637688900,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the climate action plan.  The devil is in the detail and I do not believe this Government has any intention of addressing the climate crisis we face, nor the energy, cost-of-living, housing and health crises.  I could go on, but I only have a short time.  We have a Government of crisis currently in crisis.  It strikes me as a Government living on borrowed time, going through the motions and waiting for the end.  The year 2030 is eight years away and yet there is no sense of urgency.  I was hopeful this Government and the Greens this time around would be different, but the Greens are like the Labour Party when they get into government in that they just disappoint.<\/p>  <p>  There is no point in setting targets without detailing how to achieve them and it cannot just be left up to struggling workers and families to take personal responsibility.  One cannot expect working poor to afford an electric car and solar panels, especially when this Government has not even bothered to implement the European directive, which would allow them to sell excess power back to the grid.  This Government is too busy sucking up to vulture funds and data centre developers to worry about ordinary people.<\/p>  <p>  Is the Minister of State aware this Government is in breach of EU law?  The Government has announced, on five occasions, that microgeneration is coming.  It is beginning to look like the new school in Monasterevin where I live - it is coming for 20 years.  The Athy distributor road was first proposed in 1975 which is 46 years ago.  It had more green lights than the Long Mile Road.  We need climate justice and not the flip-flopping we have seen from successive governments.<\/p>  <p>  I listened with intent to Deputy Bruton.  Where is the sense in offering incentives to dairy farmers to expand their herds, only to ask them to reduce them a few short years later?  Where is the sense in banning peat production and allowing exports, while our own producers have to import it?  We need urgent planning for an alternative to peat.  Meanwhile, tree planting, about which I listened to the other Deputy talking, is at the lowest level since 1936, due to the backlog in licensing.  Licences are being issued at one third of the normal rate.  Time is running out for the planet and it is definitely running out for this Government.  It needs to get off the stage before it does more damage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300029#CC00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1637688900,"counter":201,"content":"<p>We are amidst a deepening crisis as climate change continues to accelerate apace.  We hear of all the rhetoric and talk from Government of a just transition for our communities, grants and supports for retrofitting of homes and for electric cars.  However, that is all it is to most people - it is talk.  How can the average family afford a &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000 retrofit of their family homes, while the cost of living continues to rise?<\/p>  <p>  On top of that, we are now being told that local sports clubs are to have the primary grant for retrofitting of lighting pulled from 2022 onwards.  What kind of message are we sending to sports groups and organisations which want to do the right thing?  The message is clear that they are on their own and should not expect anything from Government.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant has been a vital resource for local not-for-profit sports clubs which want to move to a more environmentally-friendly source of lighting.<\/p>  <p>  One GAA club alone has estimated an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 30 tonnes.  Modernising two LED floodlights can cost a sports club up to &euro;80,000.  I struggle to understand how this Government thinks not-for-profit community sports clubs have upwards of &euro;80,000 in their accounts for such works.  We need to provide community organisations the supports for a just transition at a grassroots level and not put barriers in their way.<\/p>  <p>  We continue to see Irish coastal communities being failed by this Government.  Raw sewage is flowing into the swimming areas on a frequent basis.  It may be late November, but if one heads down to the Half Moon at Poolbeg lighthouse in Sandymount, one will see that people swim there all year round now, as they do at the Forty Foot in Sandycove.  However, in the eyes of officialdom, official bathing stops in November.  Why has the bathing season not been updated to reflect the reality thousands of people are swimming throughout the year?  The Minister of State has the power to amend the bathing water quality regulations with the stroke of a pen.  I ask the Minister of State to amend these bathing regulations and start to give coastal communities the support they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300029#CC00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1637688900,"counter":202,"content":"<p>It is in everybody's interest that the environment we live in is sustainable and that we can cohabitate with the natural world and the animal world.

I would compare what is going on now with the civil rights movement in the 1960s.  People are at the cutting edge.  People demand radical change.  They will ask if the governments <i>in situ<\/i>, including in Ireland, are in favour of radical change.  There is a question about whether this plan and other plans will challenge the environmental vandalism that has happened to the planet.<br\/><br\/>This plan has flaws.  A number of flaws relate to private companies involved in the plan and to the over-reliance on personal responsibility with regard to environmental issues.  There is no mention of free public transport.  There is an idea about 1 million electric cars.  When I heard that first, I thought it was a joke.  We want to get away from car culture and congestion.  People want to use public transport.  This has to be looked at collectively rather than individually.  If it is looked at individually, it will be doomed to failure.  It is costly for people in this State to get their homes retrofitted.  There has to be a State company that will facilitate retrofitting people's homes at cost prices.  There is also the issue of offshore renewable energy.  ESB is one company that is involved.  It has existed for 90 years.  That has to be looked at with regard to offshore energy.<br\/><br\/>An elephant in the room is the matter of data centres.  If the projections are correct, data centres will use an enormous amount of electricity.  It is incredible.  There are no mitigating circumstances regarding how much they will use and the damage that they will do now and in the future.  There are flaws in this plan.

I warn the Government that if it does not break from that reliance, it will turn people away from the climate agenda.  It will alienate people.  There is evidence that that is happening around the world.  On the other hand, young people understand that system change is needed.  It is not a matter of individual culpability or responsibility.  The system needs to be changed.  At the centre of what young people talk about, when they get out on the streets, is just transition.  It is not just a phrase.  They actually mean it.  It will make the lives of ordinary people better.  It is not the coded language of Deputy Bruton, who says that people need to realise that things will be tough and difficult.  That goes back to responsibility.  He went on to say why we need all the support for the corporate sector and that it will make the changes.  He needs to make up his mind.  If that road is taken, it will alienate people and all the targets in the world will mean nothing.<\/p>  <p>  After looking at the targets and then our records on forestry, it makes me laugh.  Ten years ago, when I came into this D&aacute;il, there was a target of 12,000 ha of new forest every year.  It was never met.  There was 4,000 ha or 5,000 ha of afforestation at best in that period.  We have the lowest level of forest cover of anywhere in Europe.  Instead of trying to meet the targets, we revised them downwards.  The targets in the climate action plan are half of what they were ten years ago when I came into the D&aacute;il.  There is climate ambition for you.  Meanwhile, the State forestry company is trying to sell forests.  Local communities had to fight to stop forests from being sold in my area.  It also happened in Cork recently.  One can look at the list of Coillte's sales or at previous attempts to sell harvesting rights.  That happens because the mandate of the State forestry company is about commercial activity and making money, but it is not about protecting and expanding the forest estate.  It should not have an industrial model but instead one that is about protecting the environment and guaranteeing a decent living for farmers and people who are protecting the environment through biodiversity and afforestation measures.  That is just one example of many.<\/p>  <p>  We need to invest in public transport.  It is amazing that it has not been debated since the budget.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, heads the Department of Transport, which is the only Department which had a budget cut in budget 2022.  I could give many more examples.  Unless there is an investment into just transition and the State taking the lead on system change, these targets are worse than useless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300030#DD00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637689500,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I commend my colleagues of all parties and none on their work on the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action under the chairmanship of Deputy Leddin.  We have done significant work on the policy and legislative framework for this climate action plan and on a great many other topics that we have debated in the committee with great ambition.  I note that Deputies Leddin and O'Rourke are present, along with other Members who have made a significant contribution to the process.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Glasgow for COP26.  At the conference, we heard from small island nations for which climate action is not an abstract discussion but one about the future of their islands and their existence as nations.  It puts into stark contrast the amount of change that this State must undertake.  We must use our considerable influence on the global stage to ensure that other countries, especially wealthy, industrialised countries like our own, make the significant change that we have outlined in this climate action plan and in the agreements that existed before COP26, including the Paris Climate Accords.  It is regrettable that larger nations such as Russia and China did not engage properly with COP26 and that nations, including Australia, India and China, weakened wording in the final days of the conference.  I am a glass half-full kind of person and I believe there is still opportunity within the agreement.  We can ensure that we hold nations to account.  We can use our position on the UN Security Council, albeit for a short period of time, and our influence to ensure that other nations hear our voice.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of this climate action plan, the increase in our ambition with regard to renewable electricity is clear, with a goal of 80% of electricity generation to be renewable by 2030.  The training offered through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is a sign that we want to make the necessary changes within our society, especially with regard to retrofitting.  I listened to the Members opposite, as I have for many years.  There was much criticism and very few suggestions for change.  They said that it is somebody else's fault, including big business or wealthy people, when they can be a significant contributor to the solution, which ultimately pays for the retrofitting schemes and other proposals contained in this climate action plan through taxation.  We have a substantial amount of work to do.<\/p> <p>There is one area where I am a little sceptical.  I was sceptical when the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced it and I am equally sceptical now, but not for the reasons set out by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  That area is the target in regard to electric vehicles.  With the best will in the world, I cannot see us hitting 1 million.  From a policy perspective, we should not be aiming to hit a target of 1 million electric vehicles.  Replacing the fleet like for like is not the right step.  I listened carefully to Professor Caulfield when he appeared before the committee some months ago and it led me down a path of research.  We need to be putting more emphasis on the delivery of mass transit options and on getting our infrastructural plans past the drawing board and into construction quicker than we have been doing.  I will not reference MetroLink because it is a very poor example, but there are other proposals put forward in recent years that have come to fruition such as, for example, Luas cross-city.  There are other projects that we need to prioritise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300030#DD00300","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637690100,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300031#EE00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1637690100,"counter":208,"content":"<p>My understanding is that Deputy Matthews is taking four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300031#EE00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1637690100,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Yes, but Deputy Dillon is getting three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300031#EE00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1637690100,"counter":210,"content":"<p>My apologies, I misunderstood.

We have seen so many areas of focus within this climate action plan, but I wish to focus on some practical issues that will make a real difference in rural constituencies.<\/p>  <p>  Our green image historically stems from our agricultural sector.  I want to ensure that this continues well into the future as we move towards greater production of organic and sustainable foods.  If we summarise the actions in agriculture, the plan works towards significantly reducing chemical nitrogen fertiliser use to 325,000 tonnes per annum and improvements to animal breeding and feeding, as well as increasing organic farming land almost five-fold to 350,000 ha.  I have been consistently repeating that we have to acknowledge the proactive role that agriculture will play in climate action.  The plan aims to produce 1.6 TW hours of indigenous, sustainably produced biomethane per annum, which is a huge step forward in reducing our fossil fuel imports.  Other actions include reviewing diversification opportunities for farmers, including energy production, agroforestry and woodland creation.  These are all steps where the farming community are part of the solution and their willingness to step up to the plate needs to be remembered.<\/p>  <p>  An issue raised regularly with me by constituents is the difficulty in accessing retrofit grants.  Our existing retrofitting options need to be proactively highlighted and processes streamlined to increase uptake and ensure quicker turnarounds.  It is great that the plan intends to drive demand for a new national retrofit plan.  Other initiatives include blending a low-cost loan and SEAI grants to make retrofitting affordable and viewed as a real investment in our future.  This will lead to a surge in demand for qualified people.  It is great that three further training centres for retrofit upskilling are now planned.  This is a clear demonstration that climate action and job creation can go hand-in-hand.<\/p>  <p>  Other initiatives include the introduction of a programme to decarbonise the heating and cooling sector by 2050, as well as a phasing out of the use of fossil fuels for space and water heating in all new buildings.  We are already making progress with community generation.  Further efforts will see the roll-out of up to 2.6 TW hours of district heating.  As recently as September, up to &euro;6.4 million in funding was allocated to 15 community and home energy projects in Mayo as part of the community energy grant scheme.  This was very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  The climate action plan is very likely to be the most important initiative on which many of us will speak.  The actions that we take in the short term will heavily impact the long term of climate action consequences and that essentially means the world our children will be living in.

I have heard the impassioned speeches from the Government benches.<\/p>  <p>  I want to deal with one area that is hugely important in terms of how we will deliver or not.  That area is forestry, which is unique in this document in that it is very precise in terms of its targets.  It intends, through an afforestation programme, to secure the sequestration of emissions by 0.8 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 and to deliver 2.1 Mt of sequestration of carbon dioxide equivalent thereafter.  That is hugely important.  It is almost like double counting when you sequester carbon because if you do not meet those targets that means you have to find alternative sources.  With the land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, section of this document, that accounts for nearly 45% of the targets that have been set for sequestration.  Here is the bad news: that target is not going to be met.  It is based on assumptions that we will plant 8,000 additional ha per annum of forestry.  This year, we will reach about 2,000 ha.  That is down on last year.  What is the worst part of this?  This is being overseen by a Green Party Minister, who is ensuring that forestry becomes a dead duck in terms of agricultural policy.  Over 80% of all new forests planted since 1980 were planted by farmers.  The number of farmers who are participating in forestry schemes has dropped by 80% over the past decade.  That drop is accelerating under the current Minister and regime.  If we are serious, the Government should not be setting targets and producing glossy brochures; it should be working with farmers, the Opposition and local communities to deliver a forestry policy that will secure these targets.

I am glad we are having an over-and-back exchange and I am very glad the Government wants to work with the Opposition.  We would be only too delighted to do so.  However, it is all about delivery.  At this point in time, as other speakers mentioned, we have a Government that has failed to deliver on its targets, including in regard to the public electric vehicles scheme, the retrofit scheme and training hubs.  There has been a failure to front-load the changes needed in transport.  The Government still has to get its act together on floating offshore wind.  The minute all those things are done and the targets are delivered on, then we will get somewhere.<\/p> <p> I will be straightforward again in referring to something I heard said earlier about the national broadband plan.

We all accept there will be difficulties.  There is nobody in the farming sector who does not know that is the case.

The first point I want to make is that all plans can be torn asunder by the people reading them.  They can nitpick and say this or that is wrong and will not work.  The proof of the pudding for any plan is in its implementation.  We need this plan and I agree we need to implement it.  There are certain issues we need to watch out for, one of which is ensuring we do not turn people against us in implementing it.  We need to bring everybody together.  We must speak more about the potential in the plan for offshore energy and for the west of Ireland.  For example, we need to put in the infrastructure to ensure Galway, Foynes, Cork, Ros an Mh&iacute;l and Killybegs ports are all ready to take on that potential.  We must realise the full potential of the plan from a regional economic development point of view, as well as acting on climate action.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to look at where we are at in this country right now and what grenades might be thrown in terms of issues that could create problems.  One such issue is in regard to the retrofitting of homes, on which we have seen very slow progress thus far.  I understand additional resources are being put into the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to try to move that on.  At the moment, people who apply to the scheme may have to spend two years waiting for an engineer to come out and do a survey.  I have seen that process happening, and I have seen excellent work being done afterwards, but it takes so long that people begin to lose faith.  In the past, some people received a small grant to put cavity or attic insulation into their houses.  They are precluded from applying for the new scheme, which would allow them do much more to bring their homes up to standard.  That needs to be looked at to ensure people who got a token sum of &euro;500 or &euro;600 in the past to fill cavities are allowed back into the frame and can get more support.<\/p>  <p>  An issue relating to protecting the environment was raised in the media in the past week.  The more than 670 private wastewater treatment plants that are littering our country are a time bomb.  In some places, raw sewage is spilling into people's gardens and into the seas.  A sum of &euro;300 million is the price the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was given to put that right.  Thus far, some &euro;3 million has been put into it and approximately 16 private wastewater treatment plants will be upgraded and taken in charge by Irish Water.  This is only tokenism, however, and the Minister needs to push matters along to ensure we get rid of this blight on our society.  At the moment, it is left to residents to try to maintain the treatment plants and they are failing because they do not have the money to do it.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State agrees with me that if we are to transform our transport system, we must transform our transport model.  My pet subject is the western rail corridor, which is an example of what can be done to make public transport available to workers who need to get to work in the cities.  The corridor is interconnecting Westport and Castlebar with Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  It is important that we push these projects along.  Some of them are not very expensive and can be done quickly.  They show how the transformation can happen.<\/p>  <p>  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, my remit included flood relief schemes.  We have seen the devastation flooding can cause in this country.  In my constituency, there is a number of areas where severe flooding has happened as a result of climate change.  We must ensure we address that issue, which requires addressing our way of life and living to ensure safety into the future for the coming generations.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we get closure on a number of issues on which the Minister of State is working.  One of these is microgeneration schemes for domestic dwellings where people have invested in solar panels and are producing surplus energy.  Those people had an undertaking they would be compensated for the excess energy they are feeding back into the grid.  Right now, however, they do not even have a meter to measure what is going back into the grid, there is no rate of payment and they do not know when they will be paid.  That is creating a distrust around climate action that needs to be resolved as quickly as possible.  Another small action that would help is to remove the need for planning permission to put solar panels on houses or roof sheds.  People need to know they do not have to go through that process.  It is important that we give homeowners a push, in the assurance that everything is working in the right direction.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the contributions from different speakers on the issue of farming.  Farmers want to do and will do what is right.  It is what they have always done to the best of their ability.  They will be engaging in new means of working the land and producing food.  What they need, and are looking for, is engagement and support to effect those changes.  There will be a cost to doing so and they need to see that the schemes coming into place will support that, not take money from their basic payment schemes, which are there as a family support.  Small family farmers, in particular, are very worried and that worry is added to by the vacuum that is being created.  It is important to engage with them and get schemes in place that are workable and less bureaucratic that they have been in the past.<\/p>  <p>  I heard a Deputy saying earlier that a just transition is about helping people to make a change.  That is the point.  We must help people to make the changes that are needed.  If everybody does that, the just transition will work.  Sometimes, in an effort to make those changes, we do not have the alternatives in place of which people can avail.  I have spoken on several occasions about rural public transport.  I often think about our school transport network, which delivers children to their schools in the morning, after which the buses are parked for the day before coming out again at 4 p.m.  Making better use of those publicly owned buses could do a great deal for rural transport in my constituency and every other constituency around the country.  We must utilise what we have.<\/p> <p>As well as this, instead of falling over ourselves to produce all these electric cars, we should look at how we can get people to use alternative sources.  One small example that the Minister of State might look into is a bus lane that is required from Claregalway into Galway city.  It has been documented and talked about for nigh on ten years.  It is small project, which would not require taking land, but for some reason it has not happened.  We are trying to convince people that the best way to go to work in Galway is by bus.  The private operators want to do it.  They are blue in the face asking us to provide that bus lane, so that they can guarantee people will arrive at work on time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300032#FF00400","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637691300,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Ag bog ar ais go dt&iacute; an Rialtas.

It sets ambitious targets from here to 2030 and out to 2050.  That begs the question for Members of this House of how we envision that future in 2050, 30 years hence.  How do we envision that future in different sectors of our economy and society?  For example, in transport, do we just imagine another lane on the M50 and continued congestion in and out of our cities?  Alternatively, do we envision a different transport future in which we have a connected rural Ireland, quality public transport and active travel networks that help our children move independently around our towns and cities?<\/p>  <p>  In agriculture, when we think to 2050, do we still see watercourses that are saturated with excess nitrogen, ever-increasing intensification and a monoculture in our fields and forests, or do we see something different?  Do we see a true origin green in our farming, where we still produce the highest quality of food, while promoting biodiversity and farm family incomes?<\/p>  <p>  On housing and planning, what type of communities do we want to build into the future?  Do we want atomised and car-dependent communities or sustainable communities with quality public realm and warmer, more comfortable homes?<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was an essential first Act on that imagined path towards the 2050 we want to create.  It is heartening that 129 Deputies in this House voted in favour of that legislation.  The climate action plan sets out a further roadmap, with 475 individual actions laid out.  The Opposition claims the plan is lacking in ambition, which is good because I want to go further faster.  I want to see implementation.  However, if the Opposition wants more ambition, let it lay out its vision of what 2050 looks like.<\/p>  <p>  On transport actions in the plan, although I do not propose to go through 475 individual actions, we set out to better balance movement priorities within urban areas and thereby transition the built environment from one that is vehicle centred to one that is people centred.  I am less interested in autonomous vehicles and much more interested in autonomous children.  We will implement an enhanced rural transport system through the delivery of Connecting Ireland.  This project is now out for public consultation.  We are actively encouraging people to engage constructively with it to improve the routes in the plans - there is no beating local knowledge in this regard - and help us move away from car dependency.  Another action is to continue the improvement and expansion of the active travel and greenway network, as well as to have a coherent and connected national cycle network strategy.  This will ensure that kids can get to their school independently, older people can walk safely or cycle around their own communities and our towns and cities are not choked with fumes, noise and unsafe streets.<\/p>  <p>  Under agriculture, we have numerous actions.  I will pick three.  The first is to increase the current area under organic production threefold and more.  The second is to use chemical nitrogen and fertilisers more judiciously to help farmers reduce input costs and keep the good of those inputs on their land.  The third is to promote ecosystem restoration and conservation through payment for ecosystem services and investment in actions that increase carbon sinks while promoting biodiversity, for example, in our woodlands, bogs and hedgerows and through soil management.<\/p>  <p>  In improving homes, the programme sets out to deliver necessary increase in upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship supports for residential retrofitting.

On agriculture, I have a basic and simple principle.  We encouraged farmers, particularly those on the dairy side, to be more productive and increase cattle numbers.  We have to find a way to support the productive farmer.  If there are other areas where people wish to scale back, we need to support them in doing that.  We need to find a model to preserve a sector that is highly efficient in global terms but contributes a high proportion of our carbon emissions.  This will be difficult and it is where the transition fund must play a key role.<\/p>  <p>  I will confine my comments to transport to electric vehicles.  I speak to taxi drivers and ordinary people.  People are making a seismic shift and considering buying an electric car.  Many taxi drivers have already made the switch.  They tell me that if their vehicle qualifies and based on the grant of &euro;20,000 and the savings they will make from the difference in the price of petrol and diesel versus electric charging, they can change to a new electric car virtually at neutral cost.  That is a good model.  The key feature is getting people to move to electric vehicles.  As with many others, I would like my next car to be electric.  The question is how I will take that step.<\/p>  <p>  The target of having 1 million electric cars by 2030 is an ambitious one.  In this case, however, the target has to be ambitious.  The key issues are cost and charging points.  Do we have enough charging points?  How long will it take to charge a car?  That is a key question.  On how electric cars are used, they are good for commuter driving but travelling any sort of distance depletes the battery.  <\/p>  <p>  In summary, the issue is how we use the just transition to reach our targets.  In farming, the transition fund must be used to ensure that people who are productive in farming are supported.  We need to find a way of ensuing non-productive areas make an exponential contribution towards carbon reductions.  We must not put young, productive farmers - male or female - in a position where they have to reduce their herd.  That is not an easy challenge but it is, nonetheless, an important one.<\/p>  <p>  On electric cars, we-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300033#GG00900","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1637691300,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300033#GG01000","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1637691300,"counter":236,"content":"<p>-----have to ensure we put charging infrastructure in place and address cost.

I welcome this opportunity to examine the Government's proposed Climate Action Plan 2021.  The science on climate change is clear.  As temperatures continue to rise, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, with increased risk to global food supplies and security.  We now have to act.  We can build a greener economy and society which create opportunities for us all.<\/p>  <p>  The plan lists actions needed to deliver on our climate targets.  It sets indicative ranges of emission reductions for each sector of the economy.  I will briefly touch on three aspects in the time available to me.  I welcome the Minister of State's comments that a one-stop shop will be established to help people retrofit private homes and that details of suppliers, contractors and finance options will be available.  This mirrors a call I made recently in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister of State in his closing remarks will provide an update on plans to retrofit council housing stock.<\/p> <p>As energy prices continue to rise, many people living in council housing will be eager to see the benefits of retrofitting.  We need county-by-county targets and detailed timelines so people know where they stand.  Perhaps the Minister might also touch on plans to increase afforestation.  Ireland currently has one of the lowest levels of forestry in the EU at 11%.  That is just ahead of Netherlands on 10% and Malta on just 1%.  We need serious ambition in this area to at least double the level of afforestation, which would still leave us at half the EU average of 39%.  I also appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to inject a sense of urgency into Government agencies that manage and deliver public transport.  We need more urgency around major projects.<\/p> <p> Many constituents are onto us about retrofitting schemes, particularly the elderly.  While the forms are simple and easy to use, and I commend their simplistic nature which will ensure that everybody can avail of them, the Minister will be aware of the timeline and delay associated with these schemes.  We need to do more.  If people want to work with us to ensure they have warmer homes, we need to do everything we can on the other side to facilitate that as much as possible, be it for public or private homes.  There is a great yearning from the public to assist the country in achieving its targets, whether for 2030 or 2050.  Many of those targets are ambitious but it is incumbent on all of us to work as clearly and collectively as possible to ensure we reach those targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300033#GG01200","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637691900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>The Rural Independent Group is behind everything that can be done to reduce emissions but it will not accept a carbon tax that is being foisted on the Irish people.

There are other cases of the Government closing down different situations and importing stuff into the country.  The Green Party is a city-based party with no Deputy from outside a city.

This is due to the lack of public transportation options in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture should not be carrying a levy to fight global warming.  Food is not a luxury and agriculture should not be the sector that suffers so others do not.

Deputy Matthews, who is gone now, said there was no one putting forward proposals.

Some of the amendments we put forward would have meant a 0% VAT rate on insulation or all children living 1 km or more from a school having free access to school transport.  We wanted farmers to be rewarded for making lands available for biodiversity, including scrub, and have previous penalty reduction payments reinstated.  We said the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, should be revamped to make it more economically viable for farmers and that a new and substantial carbon offsetting scheme should be introduced for the agriculture sector, which would include a blend of tax incentives and grant aid.

It is clear that the plan is not in line with climate justice.  The statement by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stating that the bulk of funding would come from the pockets of individuals and households just demonstrates how they plan for this to be yet another unfair burden on ordinary people, rather than a real and effective way to tackle the defining issue of our time.<\/p>  <p>  We are at a defining moment.  With rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, shifting weather patterns and threats to food production, the impacts of climate change are truly unprecedented in scale.  What is the Government&rsquo;s response to this?  It is not to address the fact that, according to this climate action plan, data centres are forecast to take up 23% of this country&rsquo;s electricity demand by 2030, but to aim instead to get individuals to retrofit their homes, despite the huge personal cost of this.  The Government&rsquo;s response is not to address the huge investment needed for public transport, including a well-functioning train service that might extend to my constituency of Donegal, but to try to have a million EVs on the road by 2030.  This is, again, despite the immense personal cost this will have for motorists.<\/p> <p>The solution to assist with this personal cost, according to the climate action plan, is to provide grants and support from the State balanced with some private sector funding.  I will not even begin on the issues that arise from relying on private sector funding but it is clear that none of the three Government party leaders have assisted their constituents in applying for SEAI grants recently or they would know of the huge backlog and years of waiting that applicants are currently facing.  Even if this backlog was addressed, SEAI grants do nothing to assist ordinary families.  These grants are aimed at those who already have the money to invest in retrofitting and electric vehicles.  It is clear to me that this climate action plan is restricted to the wealthy and that investment in climate action is a luxury for the few, unfortunately. <\/p> <p> In his analysis of the climate action plan, Dr. Rory Hearne rightly argues that \"Green-washing in policy should be analysed for what it is.  The vested interests of propertied speculators, fossil fuel interests, and an economy based on endless growth in material consumption can no longer hold sway.\"  The climate action plan is disappointing, at best, in addressing the issue of an out-of-control data centre sector driving the entire country towards power cuts.  I cannot stress enough the importance of urgently clamping down on data centre development.  I strongly welcome the Government's announcement that it will review its policies on data centre growth to keep them in line with emissions and renewable energy targets.  I sincerely hope the Government is true to its word on this but history would suggest otherwise.<\/p> <p> All in all, the 2021 climate action plan is too little, too late and there seems to be no attempt to bring the country together to create meaningful action in the face of an incredibly terrifying climate crisis that will sadly affect us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300034#HH00800","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637692500,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Climate change and how we deal with it is the defining issue of our generation, an issue that will impact forever, at least in human terms, on future generations.  While we recognise and accept individual responsibility, as we must, we must also look to our Government to put systems and structures in place to facilitate us as citizens to play our role, not to absolve us from responsibility but to facilitate our engagement as mothers and grandmothers of the generations to come.<\/p>  <p>  The climate action plan promises much but delivery is still very much in question.  We need clarity on how we can play our part.  One of the issues that really concerns me in all of this is the narrative of urban versus rural.  In terms of context, Ireland did not have an industrial revolution and therefore agricultural production, which sustains much of rural Ireland, makes a proportionately higher contribution to greenhouse gas emissions than in most other countries.  We also conveniently forget that Harvest 2020, stated Government policy, promoted higher levels of production and, consequently, a significant increase in the national herd.  All of this finger-pointing is getting us nowhere.<\/p>  <p>  Too many people, especially in rural Ireland, feel left out, not of the debate which they are right in the middle of, but of shaping the solutions and of playing a meaningful, positive and realistic role in mitigating climate change.  That role includes sustainable food production and Ireland and the EU recognising, for example, that we need to look again at the Mercosur agreement and all of its implications.  The role also includes payment for carbon farming.  The most crucial aspect involves individuals and communities coming to the fore in areas like, for example, microgeneration projects rather than the huge, towering wind turbines planned for places like Croagh and Dough Mountain in County Leitrim.  I refer to projects involving solar panels and small turbines because that is where we get community support, community buy-in and positive outcomes.  We need to see agro-forestry that sequesters carbon, provides income, protects biodiversity and provides areas where people, animals and plans can interact in positive ways instead of the community-destroying Sitka spruce we have marching across the landscape.<\/p>  <p>  The debate around the national herd is fraught.  It is crucial to point out that suckler herd numbers are decreasing year on year.  Slowly and quietly, a sector that underpins many rural counties along the west coast and elsewhere is fading.  In the next CAP the target for sucklers is 385,000 and the kicker is that just 20,000 farmers take part in the beef genomics scheme.  Nobody is talking about this or taking the bull by the horns.  We need an honest, robust debate about the future of the suckler herd.  Platitudes are useless.  A recent report from KPMG showed that if agricultural emissions are to fall by 30%, then farm profitability will also fall by 30%.  Is there a just transition?  If this plan is to work, and we want it to work, then we must engage with rural communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300035#JJ00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1637692500,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for contributing to the debate this evening.  At COP26 in Glasgow, it was interesting to note that there was not a single country represented that did not recognise the absolute urgency and need for us to meet the targets set in the Paris Agreement to try to keep the increase in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees.  As Mary Robinson said during the course of the proceedings, we cannot negotiate with science.  That target or limit was set for a very good reason because going above it risks us reaching a tipping point resulting in runaway climate change that is dangerous beyond compare.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, it is important to reflect that in terms of the basic science, this is not an issue that divides this House.  Nobody here spoke in opposition to the certainty that climate change is happening, that it is caused by our emissions, particularly from fossil fuels, land use and other short-lived greenhouse gases and that we have to act fast.  If we accept the science, then we must act fast and, as clearly set out, cut our emissions by half this decade and achieve net zero emissions globally by 2050.  That is a challenge beyond compare and it has never happened before.  No country has halved its emissions in a decade, which is what we are setting out to do.  However, that is what we have to do to protect the future of the next generation.<\/p>  <p>  An interesting perspective on this for a country like Ireland is to consider the alternative if we do not meet the targets.  Every other country is clearly going in this direction.  Our next-door neighbour, the UK, has set out similar net zero plans and if one looks to the Continent, the major economies of Germany and France are committed to going in this direction.  Germany is likely to accelerate now with the expected formation of a new government involving the Green Party, which will push for further and greater ambition.  The US economy is doing the same.  Despite the setback in Glasgow with the Indian and Chinese governments creating some uncertainty around the phasing out of coal, it is clear that every single modern economy is going in this direction.  It is inevitable that economies are going to decarbonise and those countries that are first in this process will benefit most.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to remember that we need to do this for basic climate justice, that is, justice for the next generation and for the poorest people in the world who are suffering most from the consequences of climate change but we also need to do it for economic reasons.  If we are not beyond compare in our ambition and do not make some of the hard decisions we need to make, we will fall behind and will not develop the opportunity that exists to be good at this, to learn how to do it and to share that knowledge and experience elsewhere.  We have the structures in place to do it.  We have political agreement on the imperative and we have a national development plan that sets out a public capital investment programme worth &euro;165 million.  An additional &euro;100 million in private capital must also be deployed.<\/p>  <p>  We also have in the plan from Eirgrid, Shaping our Electricity Future, a clear understanding of how we can develop economic opportunity across the island by tapping into renewable and microgeneration power resources.  As Deputy Harkin rightly pointed out, this has to be community centred and not just based around big business.  We know we can do that.  We also have a climate action plan that sets out the framework we will follow in order to deliver, as well as an Act that provides that if Departments are failing, they are held to account by the Climate Change Advisory Council and this House and will have to amend policies, year on year, to get us back on the path to decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>I described it at the Oireachtas committee the other day as a straitjacket, but it is an appropriate description because we have not delivered the change nor risen to the opportunity and we need to test ourselves because it is not easy to change.  The reason it is important that there is political agreement on the basic science and on the imperative is because six Governments in a row will have to follow this course.  That is what we signed up to when we enacted the climate Act.  The next Government as well as this one will have to do it.  The more thought we put into the measures and the more consensus we can get on the basic approach, the better, because then we will not be stopping and starting.  We will be giving clear signals and certainty to all people on the course we are about to take.<\/p> <p> I will briefly make a couple of points in response to some of the issues raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.  Deputy Bacik raised a valid question about the series of actions which will be published within the coming weeks to show exactly how the Government is going to hold itself to account on delivering the key measures we need to take.<\/p> <p> I heard in contributions from Deputy O'Donoghue, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and others that there is a rural-urban divide on this.  If there is, let us stop that straight away, because that does not serve anyone.  No one is pointing the finger at any one community, industry or sector and saying: \"You are the problem, you are the ones that have to be held to account.\"  We are all involved in this.  Farming will be at the centre of the solutions, but it will also be at the centre in the future in terms of paying farmers properly for the important work they do in providing food and managing and looking after our land and nature, the natural systems which are under real stress.  They are heavily polluted, and biodiversity has been lost.  Let us start paying farmers for the restoration of those natural systems, as well as the high quality food that they produce.  That is surely something that will not divide.  Why would that divide us, as we set out mechanisms to pay farmers, foresters and fishers properly, to protect and make sure that we live with our natural systems and the natural beauty that we love on this island?<\/p> <p> I always say transport will be more difficult because, in truth, through our planning in the past 50 years, we have embedded dependency on the car, which will be hard to unwind.  It is not that we are saying \"No\" to people driving.  Cars will be electric.  We will need people to have those choices and freedom to be able to move around, but the current system does not work, not just in climate terms but also due to gridlock geometry.  If we go back to reliance on those systems and replace the combustion engine with electric vehicles, we will still have those problems.  This is an opportunity to switch fuels, shift to other modes of transport and to reduce the overall volume of traffic so we can all get around in a much more efficient and better way for local communities.<\/p> <p> There are significant opportunities in energy because we have a massive resource in offshore wind in particular that we can and will tap into.  First and foremost, on this cold day, we should start with heating.  We should start thinking about how this is an opportunity to improve every single home so that we do not have to spend so much on keeping ourselves warm and healthy in our homes.  This is achievable.  I was at a very interesting meeting earlier today with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland where we mapped out some of the future for heating.  It will involve district heating, which will bring communities together.  It is a much more efficient and cheaper way of heating homes.  It will involve a switch to heat pumps from oil-fired central heating, as oil burners need to be replaced.  That is what we are going to have to do.  The Government will support it with grants and one-stop-shops, as will the future Government, because it makes such sense.  There will be a clear pathway to this better way of heating our homes.<\/p> <p> My last point is about industry.  I am only just skating over the surface.  Today, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities pointed out that all industries must play their part.  That includes data centres.  They must live within this plan.  Every sector must.  No sector is held beyond the others.  We are not naming and shaming.  Everyone in business and in industry knows that this is the way the world is going and if they want to be in business it is the way they must go too.<\/p> <p> That is what we should do as a country.  We will be good at this.  We will make this transition.  It will take time to ramp up the ports to deliver the offshore turbines we need.  It will also take time to make the switch from oil-fired burners to heat pump technology, but we can and will do it.  It will be organised from these two Houses.  Local authorities will have a central role.  We will do it together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300035#JJ00300","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Redress Scheme: Motion [Private Members]","time":1637693100,"counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300036#KK00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1637693100,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann: <br \/><br \/>acknowledges:  \t&mdash;that the State failed the women and children who were in Ireland&rsquo;s Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes institutions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that women and their children were unlawfully separated during their time in these institutions;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that women and their children were unlawfully separated during their time in institutions not investigated by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that women and their children were unlawfully separated in non-institutionalised settings, including through adoption agencies and private facilitators;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;the Taoiseach&rsquo;s acceptance of the lack of respect for the fundamental dignity and rights of mothers and children who spent time in these institutions and that the State did not uphold its duty of care to them;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology in January did not acknowledge the full extent of the human rights violations experienced by people affected by this issue;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that the State has failed to acknowledge the full extent of unlawful and forced family separation; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that the final report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters is currently being challenged in the High Court;<br \/><br \/>recognises:<br \/><br \/>&mdash;the personal trauma and human rights abuse of forced family separation;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that the harms associated with forced family separation are not dependent on length of stay in a Mother and Baby Home or similar institution;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that the harms associated with forced family separation are not dependent on spending time in an institution; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;that the exclusion of people who were in these institutions for a period less than six months, people who were boarded out, people who were in institutions not falling under the remit of the Commission of Investigation, and people who experienced forced family separation but were not institutionalised is inequitable and unjust;<br \/><br \/>commends the survivors, mothers, adopted people, their families, and the families of the children who died in these institutions for sharing their lived experiences and trauma, and those who have advocated on their behalf; and<br \/><br \/>calls on the Government to:<br \/><br \/>&mdash;seek immediate and substantive recourse from religious orders and pharmaceutical companies to contribute to the State&rsquo;s redress scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;use OAK&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report of the findings of the Consultation with Survivors of Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes&rsquo; as a basis for amending the proposed redress scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;engage immediately with the victims and survivors&rsquo; organisations and those directly affected by the scandal of Mother and Baby Homes and County Homes institutions; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;urgently review, in consultation with these groups, the following matters:<br \/><br \/>&mdash;the time-based criteria;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;the exclusion of children who were boarded out from the redress scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;access to the enhanced medical card;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;proposed payment rates;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;the failure to include all Mother and Baby Homes, County Homes, institutions, agencies and individuals involved in forced family separation;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;the legal waiver attached to the scheme; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash;amend the scheme accordingly to meet the needs of the survivors.&quot; I wish to share time with colleagues.

I clearly remember the first woman who confided in me about her time in a mother and baby institution.  It was about ten years ago, and I was a member of Kilkenny Borough Council at the time.  This lady had come to me for advice on a different matter, but she ended up telling me her story.  I still remember her sadness, partly because so few in her life knew about it.  It has stayed with me to this day.  I always felt very glad that she felt she could share her story with me.  Since that time, I have had the privilege of meeting and speaking with so many women who were forced into mother and baby institutions and many children, now adults, who were born into an institution.  Some have found their child or mother, but so many are still looking and still holding out hope, sometimes up to 50 years later, that they will be reunited.<\/p>  <p>  On many occasions within this Chamber and throughout debates on this issue I have heard people refer to this period as being a dark time in our history.  I have always struggled with this description, as while it certainly was a dark time &ndash; there is no disputing that &ndash; trying to confine it completely to history misses the serious intergenerational trauma still felt today by so many.  While the State continues to deny justice both to the women sent to these State-run institutions and to the children born there, it remains very much part of our present.<\/p>  <p>  In 2007, I was 25 when I had my first son, Emmet.  I was not married at this time.  If it had been 1967, 1977 or even 1987, I wonder if I would have found myself in a mother and baby institution.  Would Emmet have even been taken away from me?  I find this really difficult even to think about.  I remember how incredibly nerve-wracking the whole labour and birth process was.  I had great support and encouragement by my side.  I had great medical help, in particular from the midwife.  I always remember she stayed on with me when her shift ended.  What exactly must this have been like for women alone, scared, in fact, terrified, who were met not only with little or no medical help but no encouragement, kindness, support or even a reassuring smile?<\/p>  <p>  Tonight, as we discuss this, I am thinking of the woman I met who was raped at 15.  She did not know what pregnancy was or what was happening to her body.  I am thinking about the woman who had a partner.  When she discovered she was pregnant, they planned to get married, but she was taken away late one evening.<\/p> <p>She was told that she was going on a drive to visit a relative and then she was driven to Bessborough.  Her son was taken from her when he was born a few months later.  I am thinking about the woman who told me she tried desperately to get her baby back from the nuns.  Eventually, she was told he had been adopted to a county that was far away from where she was located in the south-east.  Thirty years later, when she tracked down her child, it turned out the story had been total lies.  In fact, her son had spent the first eight months of his life less than a mile from her home.  I am thinking about the man in his 60s who I met and who had spent decades looking for his mother.  Thankfully, he did find her but he only had two meetings with her before she passed away.  When he eventually received his file after she had passed away, it was filled with countless letters begging to know where her son was.  I am thinking of the woman who is still looking for her daughter born 42 years ago in Bessborough, and of so many others.<\/p> <p> Imagine, after all of that, to learn that you might be excluded from the scheme because the institution you were sent to is not included.  Imagine you only spent the first three months of your life there, not the first six months.  Imagine you are left with certain medical conditions as a result of your time in one of the institutions but you were only there for five months, not six months, so you do not qualify for the enhanced medical card.  I know a number of women who are left incontinent due to the circumstances of their childbirth and who were left traumatised and unable to form significant relationships going forward because of their embarrassment and shame on that issue.  They should not have to come and tell us such personal stories but they do.  However, one of those women did not spend six months in an institution, so she will not be entitled to the enhanced medical card.  Another lady spent five months and 20 days, to be exact, in an institution and nearly lost her leg due to sepsis brought on by the horrific treatment during her labour but, again, she falls outside the criteria.  Imagine you were boarded out or nursed out, treated like a slave and, in many of these situations, physically and sexually abused but you do not qualify for the scheme.<\/p> <p> There is no price that can be put on any of this but what the State can do is listen to survivors and their families, look at the OAK report commissioned by the Minister and use that as a starting point.  People engaged with this process in good faith, again reliving their stories, which was not easy, and now it seems it was for nothing.  Nobody should be excluded from the scheme.  It should cover 100% of survivors.  The religious institutions and the pharmaceutical companies also need to be held to account for their role in this.  They often profited at the expense of children and women and they must also pay.  Survivors and their families are tired of apologies with no action.<\/p> <p> I understand the Minister is not the person responsible for the commission of investigation and, in fact, he inherited this from predecessors who I believe were happy to kick it down the road to his door.  However, he is now in a position where he can, for the first time, on behalf of the State, ensure the right thing is done and that survivors are actually listened to and their wishes respected.  He can ensure nobody is left out of this scheme.  I fully believe he would have the support of each and every one of the Deputies in the D&aacute;il to do this.  This Thirty-third D&aacute;il must finally be the one that ensures justice is done by every single woman and child who had to pass through those horrific institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300036#KK00500","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637693700,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I tried over the last few days to think of new words somehow to crack through the State's deep-seated denial and awful treatment of the mother and baby homes survivors &ndash; women, girls and children who suffered horrific abuse and human rights violations in these religious prisons, one in my own constituency of Meath West, Castlepollard mother and baby home.  I do not have words strong enough to split the State&rsquo;s cruel and coercive attitude of disrespect towards survivors.  It is an attitude beyond any language I know.  It stands in stark contrast to the human dignity of the survivors and their families.  These women have been to hell and back.  If it was not for their courage and bravery, the shameful legacy of the mother and baby homes would have remained shrouded in secrecy, swept under the carpet.  There would have been no commission of investigation, no State apology, no redress scheme.  The survivors had to push the State every inch of this tortuous journey.  They had to chip away at a wall of silence.<\/p>  <p>  The redress scheme published last week is an insult to the survivors.  It is an extension of the flood of disrespect that these women and their families have waded through for decades.  It is shameful that the Government has brought forward a scheme that creates a hierarchy of victims by taking the view that some mothers and their children suffered less than others.  It is cruel to deny compensation and medical supports to some survivors simply because they were taken from their mothers or left the institution before six months.  Not only is it callous, it flies in the face of modern clinical evidence regarding the traumatic impact of forced separation on babies of that age.  The idea that it did not affect them because they were under six months is not only morally repugnant, but it is also nonsense in a scientific sense.  It is wrong that the Minister would seek to justify this botched scheme in this way.  This needs to be rectified.  No matter how long people spent in these places, no matter what age they were when they left, they suffered greatly and they carry the trauma and the pain with them to this day.<\/p>  <p>  Religious institutions are responsible for that pain and trauma too and they must contribute to the scheme.  The State cannot allow them to wipe their hands.<\/p>  <p>  The timing of the scheme is also disrespectful.  The Minister announced the scheme in the full knowledge that, in the very same week, survivors were in the High Court challenging the report of the commission, the report on whose recommendations the scheme is based, recommendations which survivors described as whitewashing of their abuse, especially the contention that no forced separation took place.  This scheme continues the disrespect demonstrated in attempts to seal survivors&rsquo; records, in the leaking of the commission's report to the media before survivors had a chance to see it and in the destroying of survivors&rsquo; evidence given to the commission.  What is so fundamentally wrong with the State in 2021 that it would seek to prolong rather than help to ease the trauma of these women?  This exposes again the deep and dark psyche of the State that puts its claustrophobic interest above those citizens brutalised in its name &ndash; women, girls and children who cry out for justice, for dignity and for basic humanity, while the State pushes back against those cries at each and every turn.<\/p>  <p>  Survivors do not want this botched report.  They want an equal scheme in which everyone&rsquo;s hurt and trauma is recognised.  They are not willing to leave behind anyone who spent a single breathing moment incarcerated in those wretched places.  That is an integrity, a strength and a compassion to which we should all aspire and Ireland would be a better place if we did.  I ask the Minister finally to listen to the survivors and to deliver a scheme that matches the gravity of their experiences, a scheme that is fair, just and equal for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300037#LL00200","speaker":"1506"},{"type":"speech","time":1637693700,"counter":256,"content":"<p>The redress scheme needs to be reviewed as a matter of urgency and proper consultation with organisations representing survivors of institutions which oversaw the forced separation of mothers and babies needs to take place immediately.  All of those affected need to be treated equally and fairly, regardless of age when separated, whether they were boarded out, what institution they were in or, indeed, how long they spent there.  The State has failed women and it has failed the children who were forcibly removed from their mothers.  It does not matter what age the person was when they were actually removed from their family; it has had an impact on them.  For this redress scheme to exclude children under six months of age is inequitable.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard from many of the survivors of these institutions, including the ones named under the scheme and those who are not, and their stories are heartbreaking.  Again, it does not matter what age they were as they have been very much affected throughout their lives.  Many survivors will tell us that they may have been adopted by a perfectly lovely family who gave them a good upbringing, but that does not take away the different feelings of separation, sense of loss, the feeling of not being wanted or not knowing who they are or why they were adopted.  There has been research that would indicate that children of less than six months of age are affected by separation and, indeed, only people who have been adopted can understand the concept of not having a sense of belonging or knowing exactly who they are.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot understand why children who were boarded out are not included in this redress scheme.  Many of those children were nothing short of slaves and were often terribly treated.  It was common for farming families to have a boy or a number of boys on the farm to work.  While some may have been treated fairly well, many were not and once they reached the age of 14, they left this country forever, and who would blame them?  They felt unwanted then and they feel unwanted now after they have been ignored again.  There is a need to include everyone in this scheme, no matter what age they were or what institution they were in.<\/p> <p>Religious orders and pharmaceutical companies need to finance the redress scheme or to at least contribute to it.

One woman spoke about the conditions her mother endured while giving birth and stated her mother &quot;was tied to the bed and when she couldn't push, one of the nuns sat on her chest to make her&quot;.  On the immoral and evil practice of forced adoption, one person stated her son:<\/p> <blockquote> \twas wrenched from my breast by one of the nuns whilst I was feeding him and taken away for adoption. ...

It has been too little in terms of the amount of redress and the number of people it is proposed to include in the scheme.  This Government has failed at every turn when it comes to the survivors of these penal-like institutions and now they will be failed again.<\/p>  <p>  Why must it always be like this?  I will make reference to a different case involving sexual abuse in day schools.  I explained to various Ministers for Education and for Education and Skills over the years the case of sexual abuse in Creagh Lane school in Limerick.  At the time, those Ministers seemed upset and promised to act.  Their failure to act leads me to believe that any fair solutions they had were torpedoed by officials in their Department.  I ask the Minister if the same thing happened to him.  When Louise O'Keeffe won her case in Europe, it took years for the survivors to be included in redress.  The brave men in Creagh Lane school had to protest in Brussels and at the gates of the D&aacute;il to achieve fairness.  Will the survivors of the mother and baby homes need to do the same?  I hope to God they will not.<\/p>  <p>  At every point in the mother and baby homes process, the Government has placed obstacles before survivors.  The final report underplayed the actions of those institutions.  The stark reality of what happened is that these women were interned and their children were kidnapped and now we are expected to accept there will be a hierarchy of survivors.  We are expected to accept that those boarded-out children are to be excluded and to accept a redress scheme that is based on a commission report that is itself extremely flawed.  It cannot be accepted and will not be accepted by the survivors I have spoken to.  What can be accepted is a commitment to remove the time-based redress criteria and a commitment that those who were boarded out will be included in the scheme.  What can be accepted is fairness for all the survivors.  The responsibility and shame is with the organisations that ran those homes of hardship.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies from all parties read the accounts of the survivors last year.

Those parties have a desperate track record on this issue and they are stuck up to their necks in it.  It is not just them but it is also the religious institutions, the embassies and the justice system.  They were all responsible for keeping these hellholes open and for putting families through what happened.<\/p>  <p>  We are effectively talking about human trafficking and I have said that in this House before, yet a six-month exclusion is being put in place by the Government, which denies 41% of people who were in these homes from getting redress.

I said to the Minister the other day that all most of the survivors want is recognition but we are even denying them that.  Children who were boarded out were brought up already.  They must be included and there must be more consultation with the religious orders as they have a responsibility.  The pharmaceutical companies also have a responsibility in these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Women who went through these institutions and others like them, such as Sean Ross Abbey and the county homes in Thurles and Cashel in my constituency, deserve to be heard and listened to.  I am asking the Minister to do the right thing and to review the whole redress scheme immediately because it is not wanted and it is not even making the survivors happy.  It is just adding more hurt on top of the hurt that has gone on for decades.  I hate to say this but I am asking the Minister to stand up to those in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael who were stuck up to their necks in this throughout the decades.  That seems to be the only way the survivors will get what they deserve at this stage.  I am pleading with the Minister, on behalf of the survivors who have been in contact with me and everyone in this House, to do the right thing by them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300038#MM00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1637694300,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to address the issues raised in this motion.  We are all united in our belief that the State must take responsibility for the indisputable wrongs that were visited on women and children who spent time in these institutions.  As the Taoiseach stated in his apology earlier this year, \"The State failed you - the mothers and children in these homes.\"  It would be difficult to find a family in Ireland whose lives the legacy of mother and baby institutions has not touched.  It weighs heavily on individuals and on us as a country.<\/p>  <p>  Since coming into office, I have met many survivors.  I have listened to their stories and I know that for each survivor of these institutions the experience has had a unique and deeply personal impact.  There are no easy answers when it comes to trying to remedy the huge grief and anguish that survivors have experienced.  I know there is no sum of money or action that can adequately atone for the vast harm, the lasting trauma, and the impact mother and baby institutions have had on each individual who passed through their doors.  My engagement has also shown that redress for survivors is a broad concept.<\/p>  <p>  What I have found throughout the last 18 months is that Government is an imperfect vehicle for the restitution of past wrongs.  It can move slowly, often out of necessity, to deliberate, but at a time when those affected have already waited for far too long.  When the commission's report was published in January, I made it clear that this work was a priority for the Government.  In the 11 months since, we have: advanced legislation to allow for exhumation at Tuam; introduced draft legislation to allow access to birth and early life information; and opened the commission's archive to survivors.  Throughout all of this I have sought to work constructively with Deputies and Senators from all sides.  Previously, I have accepted Private Members' Bills where the intention of that legislation reflected the Government's and I have worked with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to progress legislation.  Given the sensitivity of these issues, I have aimed to seek consensus over division and to allow for these issues to be fully debated.  It is on this basis, that the Government will not oppose the motion brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in and supported by some other parties this evening.  We will be bringing forward legislation in the new year to support the establishment of a payment scheme and during that time, Deputies will have the opportunity to bring forward specific proposals with their views on that scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In January of this year, when the commission's report was published, there was significant criticism within this House and outside, of the categories suggested to be eligible for payment in that report.<\/p>  <p>Although not part of its terms of reference, the commission recommended the following three categories for consideration: people who were resident as unaccompanied children in a mother and baby or county institution; pregnant women who entered mother and baby or county institutions before 1974 and who spent six months in such institutions; and women who undertook commercial work without pay in county homes, in the Tuam mother and baby home or outside a mother and baby institution where they were resident.<\/p> <p> If a six-month residency condition was applied to the categories identified by the commission, it is estimated that 6,500 people would have been eligible for a financial payment and the cost of providing this payment and the enhanced medical card would have been &euro;400 million.  Concerns about the use of those criteria were a central theme in the debates that we have had in this House and in many of the parliamentary questions that Deputies have submitted to me.<\/p> <p> The interdepartmental group, established to bring proposals on a scheme to Government, made broader recommendations.  It recommended that all those who spent more than six months in an institution as mothers or children would qualify for a financial payment and an enhanced medical card.  This would have increased the number eligible for benefits under the scheme to 19,000 individuals and would have cost &euro;673 million.  However, in the decision the Government took last week, the Government went significantly further.<\/p> <p> Having considered the interdepartmental group's report, and noting the feedback from the consultation process, the Government has brought forward a scheme which will provide financial payments to an estimated 34,000 people and enhanced medical cards to an estimated 19,000 people.  The value of this scheme is &euro;800 million.  It will be the largest scheme of its kind in the history of the State in terms of the number of beneficiaries.<\/p> <p> In bringing forward this scheme, the Government is responding to the concerns about the categories that have been raised since the commission's report.  It will include all mothers, including those who entered an institution after 1974 and who spent any period of time in one of these institutions.<\/p> <p> It will also include children, both unaccompanied and accompanied, who spent six months or more in an institution.  This expansion recognises that a strong case was made that there was little distinction in reality between being an unaccompanied or an accompanied child in one of the institutions.<\/p> <p> For children who spent short periods of time in an institution during their infancy, and recognising the diverse understanding of redress, the Government's action plan provides a response to their needs in the birth information and tracing Bill.  The legislation will provide guaranteed access to an unredacted birth certificate, as well as wider birth and early life information for those who have questions in relation to their origins.  This is the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed by people who, as children, were adopted or otherwise separated from their birth family.<\/p> <p> It is also important to emphasise that for all survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions, counselling support is available under the National Counselling Service.  It is free of charge, includes out-of-hours support and survivors are entitled to priority access.<\/p> <p> Through the consultation process survivors made it very clear that they want a scheme that is non-adversarial, simple and based on trust.  Survivors did not want a scheme that would require evidence of the harm done to them.  The requirement for a low burden of proof was also a key issue raised.  This is what the mother and baby institutions payment scheme seeks to deliver.<\/p> <p> It was concluded that providing a general payment based on time spent, with no requirement to bring forward any evidence of abuse or harm, was the best way to ensure that this scheme causes no further trauma or harm.  The simplicity of the scheme will also allow it to be established and for payments to be made more quickly.<\/p> <p> In terms of next steps, I want to confirm that I will be seeking significant contributions from the relevant religious congregations towards the cost of the scheme.  I wrote initially to the religious authorities involved in the operation of the relevant institutions in January, when the commission's report was published.  When bringing proposals for this scheme to Cabinet I contacted them again, signalling I intended to bring forward this scheme imminently and seeking a meeting to discuss their contribution to the cost of the scheme.  I am due to meet several of the congregations in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p> Beyond the matter of the congregations' contribution, I want to assure survivors that everything in our power will be done to get the scheme up and running swiftly and that the scheme will be designed so that the applications from older and vulnerable survivors will be prioritised.<\/p> <p> Due to the magnitude of the scheme, legislation is required to establish it.  My officials are preparing a general scheme of a Bill as a matter of urgency and I have confirmed with my Cabinet colleagues that I will look for priority drafting of the Bill when the general scheme comes to Government.<\/p> <p> The mother and baby payment scheme, providing 34,000 survivors with financial payments and 19,000 survivors with an enhanced medical card, is just one element of the Government's comprehensive response to the legacy of mother and baby institutions.<\/p> <p> I have spoken already of the legislation to allow for the remains in Tuam to be exhumed, identified and reburied, of the birth information and tracing legislation giving a legal right to an unredacted birth certificate, and of access to the commission's archive which has already been taken up by 300 survivors.  We are also progressing commitments on a national memorial and records centre, which will appropriately memorialise and inform on Ireland's history of institutional abuse.<\/p> <p> We are also progressing health research with former residents, the introduction of the history of this period into the secondary curriculum through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, research scholarships on childhood disadvantage, and an examination of the terminology and language we use when discussing these issues.<\/p> <p> All 22 actions, each of which represents a particular facet of the State's response and each of which represents elements of the State's redress to individual survivors and to survivors as a group, continue to be advanced by my Department and across Government.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  Most importantly, I, again, pay tribute to the resilience, courage, engagement and patience of survivors, their families and advocates.  As a Government, we will continue to work at responding to the legacy of mother and baby institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300038#MM00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637694900,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Buckley, Mythen, Munster and Ellis.<\/p>  <p>  I want to tell the Minister and Minister of State about two boys from Kerry, James and Michael.  They were left to the mercy of this State and suffered a horrendous childhood.  They were boarded out from the county home in Killarney, County Kerry.  James was eight and a half and Michael was seven.  The State had a duty of care to these little children but sent them to work in servitude and enforced labour.  \"You are here to work,\" they were told.<\/p>  <p>  The shameful story is of James and Michael Sugrue.  They were sent to a house which had no lighting and no heating.  They were not properly fed and having authorised their boarding out, there were no adequate inspections provided by the State.<\/p>  <p>  James, who is now 70, told me, again today, he was physically and sexually abused over many years.  He was failed by the social workers who were supposed to protect him and when his education finished, his school and his council declined him a grant for further education on the basis that there would be no additional benefit to him.  James went to Hammersmith and later made a life for himself in London, and has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.<\/p>  <p>  Michael was not so fortunate.  Growing up, he had been beaten many, many times, and stripped and beaten in public with a stick on one occasion.  He suffered with addiction and mental health and was found dead alone in Crystal Palace in 1993.  This left a void in James's life which can never be replaced.<\/p>  <p>  Later in life, compounding this injustice, James was forgotten by every redress scheme.  He was not recognised.  He was denied a full Garda investigation.  At every hand's turn, the State told him that there was nothing it could do.<\/p>  <p>  Why, having listened to James, is the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, continuing to ignore him?  Offering counselling to a man at this stage of his life, he says, is an insult.  Give them the comfort of redress, please.  For once, in this State, let them be included, or will the Minister be like Michael's neighbour who said to James after his funeral that he was sorry about his brother, they heard his screams but they did nothing.

The cost of dental work and other medical procedures is extremely expensive.  They are only looking for a bit of quality of life.  They have gone through their suffering.  They are going through the pain now.  Yes, many of them wanted just to tell their stories.  They were not looking for a pat on the back but they needed to off-load.  Yet, here were are again.  Listening to other speakers earlier, I thought, my God, we have had many dark times in our history but this is something that we should be really ashamed of because we let our own people down.

The survivors had to fight every inch to even be heard, let alone be recognised.  Now they face another botched scheme.  No disrespect is intended.  It was designed, no doubt, by people who never had anyone belonging to them in these institutions or who knew anyone who endured the hardships they suffered.  It is in this context that the people of Ireland are outraged at the latest attempt to bring forward a very flawed and diluted mother and baby institution payment scheme.  It is a scheme that will prevent hundreds of survivors from obtaining enhanced medical cards because the period spent in the institution was less than six months.  It is a scheme which to all intents created a hierarchy of suffering and pain, differentiating and categorising each survivor as though one person's pain and suffering was not the same as anyone who stepped over those notorious thresholds.  It is a scheme which excluded innocent children, especially those who were boarded out and those who spent less than six months in these cold, oppressive and callous institutions, which represents about 6% in total.  The scheme must be redesigned.  We, as a nation, must do far more for the survivors of these oppressive, inhumane institutions who treated mothers and babies like chattel.  We call on the Government to listen to the ordinary decent people who want this sorted out in the dignified and honourable way.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking of honour, it would be remiss of us not to mention Catherine Corless and her relentless fortitude in her search for justice for the babies and mothers who perished in Tuam.

A number of homes and institutions and all the survivors who spent time in them have been excluded.  That means they cannot access the enhanced medical card or the financial redress but much worse than that, it means that the State does not recognise what happened to them.  That is the biggest insult of all.  The scheme has created an appalling hierarchy of victims and a clumsy hierarchy of suffering that does not reflect the experiences that survivors have had.  Yet the Minister said he listened to survivors.  It needs to be rectified immediately before more hurt and trauma is inflicted by the State on survivors.  Let us remember that the State is responsible for the harm that was done and it must take responsibility for that.  The time limits that exclude survivors must be removed.

To understand the emotional, psychological and physical distress the survivors still experience is something that can only be comprehended by those who lived through the awful experience.  We can only attempt to grasp their suffering by listening to their testimonies.  It is clear from the many stories these survivors tell that they still manifest the pain of their traumatic past each and every day.  Every day the survivors face new challenges.  As they get older, they face the additional challenges of declining health, retirement or losing their spouse.  These are things that may negatively impact on their already fragile psychological states.  Many exhibit symptoms of post traumatic stress.  While their experiences may not have prevented their ability to adapt to daily life, for many living a normal life as best as they can will involve repressing many of these traumatic memories so that they can focus on building a life.  For others, the trauma and stress of their experience has left a permanent mark which has continued to influence their lives.  The Government could have resolved this because it is the right thing to do.  Recently, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that not everybody would be satisfied with the entirety of the redress scheme.  He needs to understand that it is not simply a question of whether or not someone is satisfied with the proposed scheme but that the scheme is causing unnecessary distress to survivors.

My Labour Party colleagues and I were happy to co-sign the motion to render it more of a truly cross-party motion.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that the Government will not oppose it and I look forward to further constructive engagement on the legislation the Minister descried that will be introduced in the new year that will form the basis of the scheme.  It is a genuine attempt to work to strengthen and improve the redress scheme.  It is appropriate that we would all work on a cross-party, collaborative basis and I think survivors would want that.  Many of us have received emails from and have been contacted by survivors who have eloquently conveyed their feelings and experiences.  We have all heard the very powerful voices of survivors.<\/p>  <p>  I want to pay tribute to the incredible women like Catherine Corless, former T&aacute;naiste, Joan Burton, the late Christine Buckley, Rose and Mags McKinney, Susan Lohan, Anne O'Meara, Samantha Long and all those who used their voices so bravely in pursuing justice and who have spoken out about the injustices that they experienced.  We owe them a collaborative approach to ensure that their trauma does not become a political football and that we can move forward in a non-adversarial fashion.<\/p>  <p>  I want to express my sympathies, and those of my Labour Party colleagues, to all those who experienced suffering and distress in the mother and baby, county and Bethany homes.  Since its publication in January, the report of the commission has generated intense debate which has been both painful and cathartic for survivors as well as for our society more generally.  It has built on the reports of other shameful institutional practices in our State like the Ryan commission report, the Murphy report and so many reports that exposed the abuses to which women and children in particular endured in so many institutions over a relatively short time.  Our history of institutional abuse is horrific.  We have incarcerated people, women and children, in particular, for far too long.<\/p> <p> The witness evidence in the report really exposed the violations of human rights of so many.  We know a total of 56,000 mothers and 57,000 children passed through the institutions in the decades examined.  Thousands more were residents in other institutions outside the terms of reference of the commission.  A shocking mortality rate for infants was exposed in the report and 9,000 infants and babies in the homes covered by the report died before their first birthday.  That is a really shocking rate of 15% or one in seven.  Within the confidential committee section in particular, we learned of the true extent of abuse, both physical and psychological, suffered by survivors.  There was also the widespread practice of forced labour and the extensive practice of coerced or forced adoption.  We are all conscious that, as the Minister acknowledged, there can be no quantification of the distress and trauma caused.  It is very difficult, indeed probably impossible, to place any sort of price on what is owed to survivors by the State, religious orders and all those complicit, including pharmaceutical companies.  That is something I want to refer to.<\/p> <p> In my previous life as a barrister I had the privilege of representing survivors of abuse before the Residential Institutions Redress Board, so I have experience of working within one of those redress schemes.  I learned from so many of the terrible harms they had suffered in those institutions but I also witnessed the flaws in that system and I think we clearly learned from that scheme.  It essentially institutionalised a hierarchy of suffering in that it required survivors to provide evidence of harm and abuse suffered in institutions in order to achieve a certain level of compensation.  Appearing before the board was a very difficult and very traumatic process for those survivors who did so.  Many of them told me they felt it was pitting survivors against each other, so that was a really retraumatising impact.  It was obviously devised with the best of intentions but we see how difficult it is to develop an effective, robust compensation scheme.<\/p> <p> Learning from that, there are many aspects of this redress scheme that are very welcome and that are clearly a great improvement.  The scale of this scheme is hugely welcome, with 34,000 survivors eligible for financial payments and 19,000 eligible for an enhanced medical card.  It is to be non-adversarial and that is very welcome.  It is to be accessible and there is no requirement submit evidence of abuse or harm caused, and again that is really welcome.  There is no requirement of silence, as I understand it, and that again is very welcome because that was a really unfortunate facet of the previous scheme.<\/p> <p> Those are all the welcome aspects but of course there are also critiques that have been expressed in recent days.  They are very valid ones because there are still a number of people who will be excluded.  While it is great women survivors who live abroad will qualify, as well as those who spent less than six months in the institutions, we still see a distinction where children who spent less than six months will be ineligible for payment, as will children who were boarded out, unless they spent their first six months in an institution.  Women who spent less than six months in an institution have been excluded from the enhanced medical card scheme and that is really regrettable, especially as many of those women will have arrived at the institutions in late stages of pregnancy.  We have heard from many who suffered physical harm and medical harm as a result of incarceration.  Indeed, back on 24 February this D&aacute;il passed an amendment from my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, to give an entitlement to a medical card to all former residents of mother and baby and county homes.  I ask that the Minister consider giving effect to that intention of the D&aacute;il as expressed following a very constructive debate that day.  That is something others have also sought and it is called for in the motion.<\/p> <p> Many survivors have also expressed concern about the timeline for redress and concerns that if the scheme does not open until late 2022 then payments may not be expected until 2023.  I ask that the Minister might examine the feasibility of a programme of interim payments to survivors, as was done in the North.  I am aware he said he will prioritise older and vulnerable survivors but there is that other mechanism of an interim payment scheme and it might well meet some needs of survivors.<\/p> <p> I also want to address the point the Minister raised in his speech of who pays for the scheme and the role of the religious orders.  The executive summary of the commission&rsquo;s report was widely criticised for spreading blame perhaps too broadly beyond State and church and saying responsibility rests mainly with fathers and immediate families.  We need to re-emphasise the causative role of both State and church authorities.  We know how powerful the church was for so many of the decades in which these institutions prevailed and we know the church was also, through its teaching of ethical and moral dogma, directly responsible for generating the moral context within which shame and secrecy prevailed for so many who were incarcerated in the homes.  Not until the Labour Party's Frank Cluskey introduced what was called then the unmarried mothers allowance in 1973 did the State take any responsibility for women who had been so shamefully neglected for so many decades.  Not until 1987 did we finally pass laws to abolish the status of illegitimacy.  State and church thus bear huge responsibility for the suffering of women in these institutions.  Indeed, it was not just the Catholic Church.  We know Protestant churches also had a role in incarceration.  We are conscious also that obstructiveness was displayed by some of the orders involved during the compilation of the report and that has certainly been made public.<\/p> <p> Therefore, we need to see a much greater role for the religious orders in bearing the financial cost of redress.  I again refer to the residential institutions redress scheme and the well-known failure of church and religious orders to pay what was their fair share of redress, leaving the State to bear the disproportionate cost of the scheme.  The reasons for that have been well-aired in this House and elsewhere.  We in the Labour Party have called for religious institutions to make a fair and proportionate contribution to this redress and the Minister has stated his intention that they would do so.  If they do not, we have committed to drafting legislation to compel them to make a contribution.  I hope it will not come to that because, again, I think we have learned from the experiences of the past.<\/p> <p> We need to look at the role of private capital in the system of abuse.  In chapter 34 of the commission&rsquo;s report the issue of vaccine trials was discussed in great detail.  It is really disappointing to learn pharmaceutical companies involved in those trials apparently do not see it as necessary to make a financial contribution.  I ask the Minister that we look again at that.<\/p> <p> We must acknowledge that there are many other measures that are crucial for survivors.  This includes the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2021 our committee is currently reviewing and, of course, a comprehensive review of adoption practices in this country, which we think should be done to ensure we are truly dealing with the legacy of the past.  We must look at issues around illegal adoptions, in particular, forced and coerced adoptions and falsified birth certificates.  We need to work constructively with the Minister and we certainly intend to do so to ensure the strengthening of this redress scheme, but also that these other measures that are so sorely needed by survivors are put in place.  I look forward to doing so and I am glad that we will not see a vote on the motion, which has cross-party support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300040#OO00500","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637696100,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Every time I stand up in this House to talk about mother and baby homes I feel the weight of it.  It is always hard to know where to begin when talking about something that has caused generations of trauma for so many people.  It is difficult to convey the hurt, the bewilderment and the sheer rage that no one is actually being held accountable for these crimes and it does not look like anyone ever will be.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of what went on in these institutions is staggering.  It is horrifying.  There were forced adoptions, falsified records, vaccine trials, medical experiments, missing children, mass graves, the forced separation of families and the casual obliteration of histories.  Survivors deserve justice.  The public are behind them.  The Government still is not listening.<\/p>  <p>  Despite what the Minister claims, this clearly is not a survivor-centred scheme, nor is it based on transitional justice.  The headline-grabbing figures might look impressive at first glance but the real story lies in the details, which include time limits, the signing away of litigation rights and the disregarding of very many survivors' trauma.  Regrettably, none of this is surprising.  After all, this Government resisted attempts to give survivors access to their personal records, continues to deny the GDPR, and refused to extend the commission of investigation to allow greater accountability.  All of this compounds the abuse suffered by thousands of individuals and their families from the State-administered and church-run system that incarcerated single mothers, victims of rape, and children.  The redress scheme needs considerable reform.  If the Minister is sincere about his intention to listen to survivors, he needs to start acting like it.<\/p>  <p>  I am going to use my time to highlight some of the deficiencies of the scheme but there are many others I will not have time to address.  The Government needs to listen to the survivors groups, not to a deeply inadequate commission's report and not to attempts by the Department to limit the rights of survivors.  The main defect is the highly insulting requirement for individuals to have spent six months as a child in a mother and baby institution.<\/p> <p>Forced family separation is one of the worst human rights violations.  The State and religious orders intentionally separated mothers and babies, stigmatised them and denied them the means to find each other.  This is a lived and very real trauma, which is not bound by a minimum time in an institution.  Someone born in a mother and baby home could have spent a week there, but a lifetime searching for his or her family.  Under this scheme, that person is not entitled to redress.<br\/><br\/>Survivors have expressed their devastation at this cruel stipulation.  Clinicians and medics have shown that the six-month requisite has no basis in evidence and shows no understanding of trauma.  The letter to the Minister from over 30 experts stated that childhood trauma has the greatest impact early in childhood.  These experts pointed out that there is no threshold of time linked to this trauma and, as a result, &ldquo;having an arbitrary period of 6 months&rsquo; exposure is simply that, arbitrary&quot;.  This arbitrary time restriction needs to go.  Any and all children who were subjected to this cruel system deserve acknowledgement and redress.  That is the absolute bare minimum.<br\/><br\/>The second issue relates to the provision that those who received redress in respect of time in mother and baby homes under the residential institutions redress scheme cannot access this scheme.  This limitation is symptomatic of the absence of any understanding of trauma and a pervasive civil servant mindset that is more concerned with balance sheets than justice.  The language used in the Government&rsquo;s proposal gives a sense of the cold, unsympathetic language used.  It states: &quot;The intention is to prevent double-counting by making a second payment in respect of the same institutional experience.&quot;  In other words, how dare survivors seek more redress?  Why can they not be happy with the little they were given?<br\/><br\/>This language is condescending and paternalistic.  It makes another appearance in the third matter I will raise, that of the legal waiver.  A survivor of a mother and baby home who wants to avail of this scheme must sign away his or her rights to take this matter to court.  In essence, the Government is proposing a legal gagging order on survivors.  In other words, survivors are being told to take the official apology, and as little as &euro;5,000, to sign away their rights to any legal recourse.  Not only is this deeply troubling in principle, the proposed scheme&rsquo;s language reveals the patronising attitude of the Government, which acknowledges that: <\/p><blockquote>\tapplicants may be disappointed at the inclusion of a waiver in the Scheme, and some may interpret it as representing a failure to take responsibility or ... be truly accountable.  This is not the case. <\/blockquote> <p>Why is this not the case?  The Taoiseach apologised.  In other words, sign away your rights and be happy with an inadequate apology.  The Government goes on to explain how survivors should accept redress as it will spare them burdensome court procedures and the risk of incurring high legal fees.  It does not take a legal expert to read between the lines here.  If survivors do not sign the waiver, their other option will be an adversarial court case because the State will oppose them.<br\/><br\/>The Government seems to have no appreciation of the anger among survivors and the general public.  People are simply not going to stand for this redress scheme.  Not only is there a complete lack of understanding and empathy for survivors, but no lessons have been learned, for example, from the ongoing mass rejection of the CervicalCheck scheme.  The same will happen with this redress scheme unless major deficiencies are rectified.  Survivors will rightly reject it and they will be supported by society.  Limitations, caveats and waivers were found in previous redress schemes for survivors of institutional and clerical abuse and Magdalen laundries.  The difference now is that we will not stand for it.  In the past week, we have got a sense of the anger and frustration at this scheme.  The opposition to its flawed elements will only increase when it comes to the legislation.<br\/><br\/>If the Minister will not make the necessary changes because it is the right thing to do, perhaps he will do so in response to the waves of public pressure that are on the way.  We saw it last year with the public outcry concerning the archive of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes.  Society has changed.  People are incredibly angry at the abuses perpetrated by this State and religious organisations.  Furthermore, they are shocked at the treatment of survivors and this anger will not abate.<br\/><br\/>The next issue is the Minister's reference to the birth information and tracing Bill as being part of the Government&rsquo;s response.  During pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, we heard from survivor groups, human rights advocates and experts, and data rights experts who pointed out multiple issues with the legislation.  It places barriers on access to birth records, limits early life and care information and denies siblings and other relatives access.  The legislation needs significant changes if it is to come anywhere near what the Minister is claiming it does.<br\/><br\/>Where is the accountability?  Ultimately, nobody is being held to account for the worst abuses perpetrated by this State against its citizens, including vulnerable young women, people with special needs, victims of rape and incest and members of ethnic minorities.  Why are existing laws against incarceration, forced labour or human trafficking not being applied?  Why is there one rule for church and State and another for everybody else?  Why has the coroner not investigated the unnatural deaths that occurred in these institutions?  We know there are mass graves and we know that crimes occurred.  Instead of responding by seeking justice and accountability, the Government&rsquo;s burials Bill limits the powers of the coroner to investigate.  You could not make it up.<br\/><br\/>Disgracefully, the outline of the scheme informs us that the Minister has written to the religious congregations seeking to &quot;meet with them in order to discuss how they might contribute to the Scheme.&quot;  This is cap-in-hand stuff.  It is 2021, not 1950.  Where are the demands for justice?  Where are the attempts to seize the proceeds of illegalities?  These orders profited from these systems.  Not only did they receive State payments; they participated in forced labour, human trafficking and the sale of babies for money.  Many of the people who committed these heinous crimes are now deceased but not all, and the orders still have assets from the money made off the backs of young mothers, children and babies.  Where is the scheme to seize those assets for survivors?<br\/><br\/>I do not have the time to raise other deficiencies, such as the overall inadequacies of the financial amounts and the limiting of the scheme to certain institutions, but these will also need to be addressed.  While the scheme in its current form has many insulting and callous flaws, it is not a done deal.  The Government still has time to do the right thing and put in place a scheme that is survivor centred and based on transitional justice.  There is still time to do the right thing by survivors but the Government should know that if it does not, survivors will not stand for it and nor will any of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300041#PP00200","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637696700,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

We agree with everything that is in it and thank them for bringing it forward.  It has only just become apparent to me that the changes we submitted in our amendment were purely additions.  We did not propose to delete the motion.  I want to make that clear.  That line has been added by the Bills Office.  We sent in additions, with a couple of changes, but nothing substantial.  They were all additions to what was there because we agree with everything in the main motion.  I just want to make that clear.  The idea was it should not be a choice between the motion and the amendment.  The Bills Office have done it that way and I do not understand why.<\/p><p>I will set that aside because the more important point is the message that gets across to the Government on this matter.  I am telling the Minister now that he will have to revisit this.  Arbitrary time periods, or tables of compensation linked to time periods, are offensive.  They completely fail to take into account the reality of coerced, forced separation of mothers from children.  The trauma, suffering, impact and lifelong and varying consequences are unique to every single case.  There should be no attempt to try to link those consequences to arbitrary time periods in an institution, or to a table with amounts of money linked to time periods, and it is offensive to do so.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to think about it.  It is shocking and he will have to revisit it.<\/p> <p> I was born in a mother and baby home and from what I understand, I was in two mother and baby homes.  I do not know how long I was in them and I am sure many others do not know how long they were in them either.  The impact could be horrendous if you were in a home for one day and it could be somewhat less if you were in one for six months, depending on the outcome.  However, in every case, the primal wound of children being separated from their mothers and mothers being separated from their children is a crime that was committed by the church and State against tens of thousands of mothers and children.<\/p> <p> To create arbitrary thresholds that you reach, where the State considers you worthy of redress, is absolutely offensive.  I know the Minister did not mean to be offensive, but the problem with this whole sorry saga, which is about the crimes of the church and the State against mothers and children and their then trying to cover their backs and limit the damage, is that he has ended up compounding the hurt, insult, abuse and trauma perpetrated against mothers and children and retraumatising the victims.  It is obnoxious.  I know the Minister did not mean to be obnoxious, but that is the net result.<\/p> <p> This compounds what was done with the commission of investigation report in which the testimonies of the survivors were relegated to being relatively unimportant.  Whether that was intended or was just a gross mistake, I do not know, but it was wrong.  One of the things we have added in our amendment is to say that report must be fully repudiated in terms of its conclusions.  Some of the stuff in that report was offensive.  I am just telling the Minister it was offensive.  There is no point in saying it was not offensive because it was.  Some of what is in this scheme is offensive.  I do not believe it was deliberate, but it smacks of the State covering itself and trying to limit things, instead of trying to do right by the survivors and victims of this whole horrible scandal.  We have to walk in lockstep with the people at the centre of this - the mothers, children and survivors - if we are to get this right.  This scheme has not done so and I ask the Minister to review it in consultation with the survivors.<\/p> <p> Our amendment also adds to the motion a demand that if the church institutions and pharmaceutical companies, which have a lot of assets, do not pay their fair share to fund redress, they must be forced to do so.  We should state clearly that their assets will be expropriated if they do not do so.  I do not know what half of these institutions are still doing running our hospitals and schools.  Rather than us asking them nicely, they have to be told and if they will not do it, they have to be forced.<\/p> <p> I will not bother with other individual details.  They are in the amendment we proposed.  However, the point has already been made by Deputy Cairns and others that what the Minister has said about those who are not included in this scheme having guaranteed access to all their identity records and birth certificates in the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2021 and so on is not true, according to people who have looked at that legislation closely and also as I see it.  We need to address that.<\/p> <p> The other changes we have proposed are to say that sometimes it is forcible separation - in fact, it is always forcible - but the way in which it is forced can be coercion or force, it can be unlawful technically or lawful technically, but it is all wrong.  To create a hierarchy and distinctions that do not understand that human reality is wrong and the Minister needs to revisit it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300042#QQ00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637697300,"counter":275,"content":"<p>It has been clarified to me that the Deputy's text is additional, as opposed to a replacement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300043#RR00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1637697300,"counter":276,"content":"<p>It is additional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300043#RR00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1637697300,"counter":277,"content":"<p>That is what I have been given to understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300043#RR00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1637697300,"counter":278,"content":"<p>A game of divide and conquer is being played here and I believe it is entirely deliberate.  There are 58,000 survivors of mother and baby homes in this State.  The redress scheme will provide financial compensation for 34,000 of them.  Thousands will receive no compensation whatsoever.  These include the children who were boarded out and all those who left the homes before attaining the age of six months.  Divide and conquer is being played out here.  The survivors to whom I have spoken believe so and I have spoken to many of them.<\/p><p>More than 30 experts in childhood trauma wrote to the Minister saying these provisions ignore best practice guidelines in neuroscience, childhood trauma and attachment.  They make the following telling point: &quot;The earlier the impact of trauma the more long lasting the effects&quot;.  That rather spectacularly undermines the Minister's crude six-month cut-off rule.  Rosie Rodgers, a survivor of Castlepollard, put it very well and pointed to the divisiveness of the Minister's policy when she said: <\/p> <blockquote> \tAnything after six months and you are acknowledged.  Anything less and your pain doesn&rsquo;t count.  Everybody who spent a day in those institutions, it has left its mark.  There is no inclusiveness in this redress. <\/blockquote>  <p>Nor is the compensation adequate for the 34,000 survivors.  Furthermore, forcing people to wait until 2023 to receive payment is unfair.  Many of the survivors are, of course, elderly.  Interim payments are being made in Northern Ireland.  Why is that not happening here?<\/p><p>I will say a few brief words about the role of the Minister and the Green Party in all of this.  Many people voted for the Green Party in general election 2020 and, in doing so, they voted for change in many cases.  They wanted something different and bought the idea that the greens were radical.  However, what they see here is the old politics, including an attempt to divide and conquer with people who are victims of oppression.  Those people cannot see any difference between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and they have a strong point.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300043#RR00500","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1637697300,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for putting forward the motion.  I supported and put my name to the motion on the basis that the idea of dividing people has come across very badly with survivors.  In the past week, I have spoken to a number of survivors about the redress scheme.  They are disappointed because they all came into this together, told their stories together and bared their souls in public and private to tell people what had happened to them.  They did not do it for any reason other than wanting to get, first, an apology from the State and, second, recognition for what they had gone through.<\/p>  <p>  As one of the survivors said to me, the first six months went grand and then it turned after that.  One day in one of these homes could have caused somebody as much trauma and anguish and left as big as mark as it did on somebody who was there for five or six years.  That is why the idea of segregating, categorising and dividing people has created resistance to the redress scheme.  The scheme is well-intended.<\/p> <p>The Minister talked about the cost of the scheme.  I take a different view.  I do not believe the State should look at the cost as much as it looks at what the cost in human terms is to the people who were in these homes, both the mothers and the babies, and the lives they have led in the meantime.  They have carried this burden and anguish for years.  Whether it was a month, a day or six years, the anguish and pain are still there.<\/p> <p> Sometimes when we try to do something good, we get it wrong.  This redress scheme needs to be re-examined.  We should not try to divide and segregate people.  It is also important to realise, as a previous speaker said, that the survivors are getting older.  Many survivors have told me over the last five or six years that this is not about money but about recognition and the State saying it will try to do something for them.  When it says it will do something for some people but not for others, because they were not in a home for long enough, how do we address that?  People have asked me if they have to serve an apprenticeship before they qualify.<\/p> <p> We have to look at this and say this is not what it is all about.  It is about real people who have suffered more than enough.  We are talking about events in the past.  We are not proud of them, but we have to stop talking and act.  We have to get people what they require.  They have placed their faith in modern politics and the politicians of today to make sure they get what they deserve.  I think the Minister has accepted the motion but he has to go beyond that.  It is not just about not opposing the motion.  We have to see this redress scheme broken apart and put back together in conjunction with all the survivors and advocacy groups in order that we can create something that is fitting for what we are dealing with.  It is a major part of people's lives.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, there is passion about this.  It is not a political issue but one of everybody trying to do the right thing.  That is why we are talking about this motion tonight.<\/p> <p> As politicians, we come across some things that we say are not right.  I was talking to a survivor on Saturday.  He said he was lucky because he was fostered to a good family and good home.  There are good stories.  He farmed the land for 40 or 50 years and was left the farm.  When it came to giving him the land, he had to pay stamp duty at 7.5% because he was a foster child, as opposed to paying stamp duty at 1% as if he was the son.  He told me that survivors are being victimised everywhere they go.  Despite what the paperwork said, this was a family handing its son the family farm.  Even though this man was fostered, he had to pay 7.5% stamp duty.  When he tried to get it back, he was told those were the rules.  We have to ask why the rules are there.  They are not supposed to victimise people but to help them along.<\/p> <p> The other part of the motion that we have to look at, which was spoken about earlier, is its call on the Government to \"seek immediate and substantive recourse from religious orders and pharmaceutical companies to contribute to the State&rsquo;s redress scheme\".  We have to be strong on this.  The pharmaceutical companies played a part in all of this.  They cannot be allowed to just walk away.  They need to own up to what they were doing.  I spoke to a woman who was in a home in Cork.  She told me that after having the baby, she was given a tablet.  She did not know what it was for and she never found out.  It is not recorded in any medical history.  Experiments were carried out for the benefit of pharmaceutical companies without the knowledge or express permission of the mothers or the children.<\/p> <p> We have to say to the religious orders that they need to own up too.  I went to school in Tuam.  The mother and baby home was probably closed before I started secondary school in the town but I know many people who remember it.  They remember how children were segregated when going to classrooms and schools.  They would be brought in after everybody was in the classroom brought out before anybody else was let out.  One said that by changing the redress scheme to provide nothing for those who were there for less than six months and something for those who were there for a longer period is the same as when they went to school.  They were treated differently then and people are being divided and treated differently now.<\/p> <p> We have to ensure survivors and their families receive the recognition they surely deserve.  They need the State apology, which has already been given, to be repeated many times.  We have to show them respect.  We have to give all of them restitution for what happened to them.  We cannot be selective.  That would not be the right thing to do.  It is not about the money but the people who suffered unjust experiences, some of which are probably indescribable.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge all of the work the Minister and Minister of State have done but this scheme needs to be overhauled before it goes further.  We do not want to have any more anguish for the survivors.  I acknowledge all of the survivors who I have met and who have written to me.  Some have become friends.  They have done everything they have been asked to do.  They have been polite and brave.  At times, they have gone through much anguish when telling the public what they went through.  It has been a watershed for them.  I hope this redress scheme will become a watershed for this State, making sure that we do something right for these people.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the work of Catherine Corless from my home town, Tuam, and her family.  They have gone through a journey with her as she did all this work and research to expose what happened in the town.  Tuam is not the only place where it happened, unfortunately.  We have an opportunity and I would welcome the efforts of the Minister and Minister of State to make sure the scheme is for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300043#RR00600","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637697900,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in.  I was too late to sign the motion, but my heart is in it.  This has been a terrible time in the history of our State.  It is 11 months since the commission of investigation delivered its final report.  The payment scheme was finally published on Tuesday, 16 November.  The payment involves an &euro;800 million redress payment for 34,000 survivors of mother and baby homes and county homes.  However, we know from the response of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the D&aacute;il last week that an estimated 58,000 survivors of mother and baby homes are alive today.  This means that the compensation scheme will not be available to 24,000 other survivors, including babies and women who were in these homes.  These women were treated shabbily from the start by parents, religious orders, different Governments and health boards.<\/p> <p>Many babies died from neglect and not getting the medical care or interventions that would have kept them alive.  Clearly, for the religious orders in the mother and baby homes, the money that they made was more important to them than keeping babies alive.  Many babies were taken from their mothers and sold into adoption.  Can you imagine that?<\/p> <p> Last year, the Government tried to keep the records from those trying to contact sons or daughters and, likewise, sons and daughters trying to find their mothers, and stated that they had been destroyed.  It must be a divine right that a child is not impeded from finding out the identity of his or her mother or father.  No arm of the State should in any way impede a person trying getting that information, if available.<\/p> <p> What happened to the babies in Tuam by way of mass burial in a septic tank was absolutely terrible.  I watched the RT&Eacute; programme a week or so ago.  It was horrific.  The Government now wants survivors to put their signatures to what it is offering them by way of redress and is trying to ensure that there can be no further claims.  This tells me that the Government knows that what it is offering is in no way adequate.  Why else would it be trying to get survivors to sign on the dotted line?  The scheme provides that unless a person was resident in a mother and baby home for more than six months prior to his or her being adopted out, no redress will be payable.  Who decided that a child would have to have been in a mother and baby home for six months or more?  A group of women contacted me in the past few days.  They were outraged because one of them was in Bessborough for four months and another was there for five.  They are being denied any redress.  I would like to meet the person who set that time limit.  Those who were boarded out to other homes are also not entitled to redress.<\/p> <p> The Government is not even halfway there.  It must do right and be seen to do right.  It must rectify the wrong that has been done.  A savage wrong has been done to these survivors.  It is wrong that people would be left out regardless of whether they were there for a short period or for much less than six months.  I cannot understand how the Government thinks it is going to get away with this.  What is on offer is not adequate.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this again and ensure that all survivors, male or female, are looked after properly.  The manner in which the Government is going about this in terms of requiring these people to sign on the dotted line that they are happy with what they are getting leaves me in grave doubt as to what it is doing.  I am very worried about it and I cannot stand over it.  I ask the Minister to look at the matter again.<\/p> <p> I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of these misfortunates who have been treated so badly in our State, and by many people in our State, and not that long ago.  Many of them are still alive.  I am asking the Minister to look at this again.  I am not shouting or roaring; I am appealing to him to look at this in a fair way because what is happening in regard to the nine people who were in the homes for less than six months is wrong.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this again and to do what is right for those survivors.  Now is the time; do not let it pass.  Do not delay because many of these people are on their last legs.  Medical cards should be awarded to each and every one of them to ensure that while they did not get proper medical treatment at the time they were born into these homes, they will at least get it for the remaining days of their lives.  I appeal to the Minister to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300044#SS00200","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637698500,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue.  I completely support Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion for an expansion of the mother and baby homes redress scheme to all former residents of mother and baby homes regardless of how long or short their stay.  I thank Deputy Funchion for bringing this motion to the House.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the words of the survivors' group, who I listened to and met outside the gates of Leinster House today and who described the mother and baby homes redress scheme as a travesty of justice.  It truly is a travesty that those who lived or were born into these terrible institutions and spent less than six months there have been completely left out and excluded from claiming deserved redress.  Who are those in government to put a timeline on trauma or to decide at what point survivors deserve compensation for the awful conditions in which they were forced to endure?  It is a complete insult to these survivors who have already been failed by this State time and again.  We really ought to be ashamed of ourselves for allowing this to happen.<\/p>  <p>  This redress scheme is not inclusive and does not meet the needs of the survivors.  It is clear that there is a complete lack of survivor voice within this scheme.  We cannot create a scheme without the input of the people it affects.  This should be at the heart of every redress scheme that is established and it should be the priority of all schemes going forward, be they in respect the mother and baby homes or the mica issue.  It is of utmost importance that those affected have a large part to play in discussing the impact and the redress that is due to them.<\/p>  <p>  It is a simple face of governance and politics that when attempting to provide some form of monetary redress to a portion of the public, tragedies must be quantified.  My issue is that the mother and baby homes redress scheme appears to be an operation of spreadsheets and finances, with little or no evidence that the survivors were at the heart of things.  It seems as though a kitty was agreed upon and, on the basis of that amount, the tragedies of survivors were weighed up and calculated.  As I said, I understand that a certain amount of box ticking and bureaucracy must be accepted and expected in order for such schemes to operate.  Subjectivity in application will not work.  However, in cases such as this, the starting point should not be a final budget or monetary limit.  The starting should be, and must be, the survivors.<\/p>  <p>  If we must quantify the pain suffered by Irish citizens, pain that was sanctioned by the State on our behalf, then the Minister must listen to the survivors and base the quantification of the redress not on what has been deemed available but on the Government's genuine desire to offer a meaningful gesture of sorrow and remorse towards those women, children and families who it so gravely wronged.  The impact of early trauma cannot be understood by anyone but those who have experienced it.  Such trauma should not be overlooked.  The time spent in mother and baby homes should be completely irrelevant and the fact that anyone was forced into these institutions against their will, separated from their babies or their mothers, should be the sole focus here.  It does not matter for how long they were forcibly separated, the fact of the matter was that they were, and wrongly so.  We cannot measure wrongdoing by how long it went on, but rather and simply whether the act was wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The reports that have come out over the past few years regarding these institutions are truly harrowing.  It is devastating to read of the huge loss of lives in these homes.  In the Stranorlar County Home in Donegal, 343 illegitimate children died in infancy or early childhood.  Many of those who lived were subjected to awful conditions and, unfortunately, experienced separation anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues throughout their lives.  The very least that we can do is give full and fair redress to every single one of those impacted.<\/p> <p>It is the very least the survivors deserve after all they have been forced to endure and continue to endure.  I am calling on the Government to do the right thing.  This is a shameful chapter in our country's history.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend it did not happen.  We need to address it and support the survivors.  We must give each and every one of them proper redress for the pain, sorrow and heartache that the State, in our name, has caused them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300045#TT00200","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637699100,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Funchion for tabling the motion and Solidarity-People Before Profit for the proposed additions.  I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate.  I recognise the work the Minister has done to get us to this point.  I could go over the history of the issue but will not do so in the limited time available.  Instead, I will focus on a number of issues and refer to several submissions and reports.<\/p><p>First is the submission to the Government from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, which includes a number of observations and recommendations.  On page 22, it states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBy the Commission of Investigation's own admissions, it did not take a human rights-based approach.  This has resulted in findings and recommendations that do not reflect Ireland's human rights or equality obligations and in turn is not an adequate mechanism for identifying the full universe of survivors. <\/blockquote>  <p>I acknowledge that the Minister has gone a little beyond the commission's recommendations, but not far enough.  The IHREC submission further states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn the past Ireland has been criticised for its narrow interpretation of the category of persons who should qualify... All participants emphasised how the Final Report failed to recognise the gravity and magnitude of the human rights violations that occurred in Mother and Baby Homes and related institutions... [They reported] a perceived lack of recognition [I would go much stronger than that] of trauma of being separated from mother or child and the 'family destruction' therein. <\/blockquote>  <p>The Minister has come forward with a scheme and, notwithstanding his best efforts, he is now perpetuating that discrimination all over again and adding to survivors' trauma, whether he likes it or not.<\/p><p>Let us consider the people, other than my colleagues and me, who have made that case.  The open letter the Minister received from therapists was a bold statement.  They do not often do such a thing and I welcome it.  The letter has 30-plus signatures of professionals who have spoken out.  They state: &quot;Firstly, childhood trauma, which includes separation from primary caregiver and exposure to multiple caregivers in an institutional setting, has the greatest impact early in childhood.&quot;  Lack of time prevents me from reading out the whole letter but I ask all members of the Government to read it.  The authors further state:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSecondly, there is no quantum of time that allows us to think about the impact of childhood trauma.  Thus, having an arbitrary period of six months' exposure is simply that, arbitrary.  What is known from research in the area of childhood trauma is that it is the combination of adversity and quality of relationships which confer risk. <\/blockquote>  <p>They go on to refer to research in this area.  Having had the privilege, in a previous life, of working in psychology, I refer the Minister to the work of John Bowlby, which we knew of as students, even when we were not paying much attention to our studies.  We knew the importance of the early childhood bond, as outlined in the letter.<\/p><p>The submission from the IHREC likewise asks the Minister to withdraw the six-month residency distinction.  However, he is persisting with it.  I looked for some idea as to where that criterion came from and what the justification is for it.  I am afraid, like Deputy Barry, I cannot think of any reason other than a monetary one.  The report of the interdepartmental group reflects the fact it did some good work, but it was done within a financial framework and without any understanding of the trauma that was caused by many parts of the experience of survivors, particularly by the separation of mother and baby.  There is an utter failure to recognise that and, again, a perpetuation of the abuse.<\/p><p>I apologise if I am sometimes too passionate about this issue but I know it inside out from both professional and personal experience.  The personal has nothing to do with my role in the D&aacute;il but the professional side does.  It is our duty to highlight every occasion on which this Government and other Governments have perpetuated this injustice and the misuse of language.  I notice, for instance, that the interdepartmental report refers to the importance of kindness.  I certainly agree that kindness is a quality that should be inherent in a just system based on principle.  The report talks about the principle of kindness.  In fact, kindness is not a principle; it is a quality that should be present in any interaction with the State.  What is important are the principles of justice, proportionality, fairness, equality and so on.  That is not recognised in the interdepartmental report or the proposal with which the Minister is persisting.<\/p><p>On page 35 of the interdepartmental report, we get some idea of why the six-month residency condition is included.  It is stated very clearly and quite adamantly, as outlined earlier in the chapter, as follows: &quot;The group is strongly of the view that the six month residency criterion is particularly important when considering children [I do not know whether the Minister has read this] as it [the interdepartmental committee] does not want to create a circumstance whereby being born in a mother and baby home or a county home is deemed a basis for the redress under the scheme&quot;.  There we have it.  The mere fact that someone was born in a home is not going to give him or her any right or entitlement.  That brings home to me the utter failure to understand what we have all been guilty of in allowing what happened in mother and baby homes in Ireland.  An apology was given by the Taoiseach and other apologies were given in 1999 by Bertie Ahern.  We are utterly failing to act on those apologies in a meaningful fashion.<\/p><p>As the time is almost up, the final point I will make is that serious consideration must be given to the provision of interim payments.  This is a vulnerable group of people, of whom more than one third are aged over 70, one third are aged between 60 and 70 and one third are nearing 60 years of age.  That has to be first and foremost in our minds.  I cannot escape the conclusion that decisions were made on the basis of money.  The exclusion is not done on principles of justice or equality but for the purpose of saving money for the State, religious institutions and pharmaceutical companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300046#UU00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1637699100,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I thank Members for their contributions.  In January this year, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, the State and its citizens, apologised for the profound generational wrong visited upon Irish mothers and their children who ended up in mother and baby homes or county homes.  He stated categorically that the State did not uphold its duty of care and thereby failed these women and children.  He acknowledged that an apology alone was not enough but only a first step.<\/p>  <p>  The Government had undertaken to respond to the needs of survivors in consultation with them.  As stated by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in his opening remarks, while the Government strives to deliver an inclusive response, there are no easy answers when it comes to providing a remedy to the significant grief and anguish caused to the women and children who spent time in these institutions.  In many respects, it is not possible to replace what has been lost to survivors.  No financial reward or service provision can take back the hurt, loss and distress that were suffered through decades of failure.  Nevertheless, the Government is earnest in its wish to provide an enduring response to the priority needs of all concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions begins with an apology.  It is broad-reaching, encompassing actions under a wide variety of themes, which include a survivor-centred approach, the apology, access to personal information, archives and databases, education and research, memorialisation, restorative recognition, including health supports and financial payments, and dignified burial.  Although only recently published, work on the action plan has been under way since January to ensure the 22 action plan points set out across the eight themes are developed and implemented.  The mother and baby institution payment scheme, while hugely important and, indeed, the most significant scheme of its type in the history of the State, is just one element of the plan.  The Government's intention is to deliver a payment scheme that is non-adversarial, simple and respectful.  Work on the scheme is already under way.<\/p>  <p>  It is important, in addition, to highlight the other hugely significant elements of the plan.  These actions are not only important to the Government in demonstrating sincerity in addressing the wrongs of the past but, more crucially, they are vitally important to the survivors.<\/p> <p>First, counselling to support all former residents has been in place since before the publication of the commission's report.  The service has been strengthened with additional investment and an expanded out-of-hours support.  The Government has published the general scheme of a birth information and tracing Bill.  This is currently the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny.  It will provide guaranteed access to birth certificates and wider birth and early life information for those who have questions about their origins.  It will also provide a robust statutory tracing service to support family contact and reunion.  The Government is committed to advancing institutional burials legislation to provide for dignified and respectful treatment of remains at Tuam, and elsewhere if necessary.<\/p> <p> On the same day that the Government approved proposals for the mother and baby institutions payment scheme, it further progressed two other important actions, both of which are intended to demonstrate the its commitment to acknowledge the failings of the past and to learn from those failings.  The first of these actions is the creation of a children's fund to honour the memory of the children who died in mother and baby homes by providing supports to children who experience disadvantage in the present day.  The second action is the creation of a national memorial and records centre.  This action is hugely important to survivors.  A scoping group chaired by the Secretary General to the Government will develop an overarching vision and proposed approach to the creation of a national centre.  It will then be brought to the Government for approval.  Both of these actions are tangible demonstrations of the Government's determination not to forget the past and not to repeat the past.  They stand as part of the gesture of acknowledgement, apology and healing to those who were failed as mothers and as children.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the amendment to the motion tabled this evening.  I value all contributions from Deputies on this most important of issues.  However, the motion calls for action that would be grossly unconstitutional.  The Chamber cannot and should not seek to pre-empt or anticipate matters that are under the examination of the courts.  The Government simply cannot support the amendment.  I thank all Members for their time this evening in debating this important matter.  I echo the Minister's opening words of appreciation to survivors and their families as the Government continues to work through these complex issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300046#UU00300","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637699700,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The Minister needs to go back to the drawing board.  The scheme has been widely condemned by survivors and experts.  On a human level, it dismisses their suffering.  It basically says that many of their experiences are not traumatic enough to receive redress.  Boarded-out children and infants who spent less than six months in these appalling institutions are completely excluded.  A group of 30 childhood experts wrote to the Minister over the weekend explaining why this is a shocking decision.  Trauma cannot be measured by time periods.  The Minister completely ignored the views expressed by survivors in the OAK report.  That is insulting to survivors who have experienced decades of appalling treatment by this State.  The Minister has created a hierarchy of victims here.  I do not believe he intended to do that, but that is the reality.  The current proposal is heartless and tone-deaf.  I welcome that the Minister spoke to religious institutions, but he needs to speak to the pharmaceutical companies involved and demand that they, too, pay for the pain and suffering they caused.  Forced adoptions, forced labour, physical and sexual abuse and vaccine trials happened in these institutions.  They should all be held to account, along with the State.  It is a dark stain on this State's history.  The Minister needs to listen to the criticism of this scheme and make the changes that are needed for it to be acceptable for survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300047#VV00300","speaker":"1464"},{"type":"speech","time":1637699700,"counter":290,"content":"<p>We would not be here this evening if the Minister had used the findings of the OAK consultation with the survivors of the mother and baby homes.

I thank all of those who have engaged with Deputies across the House and told us their stories.<\/p>  <p>  Some of those who are watching tonight have raised a couple of things with me since the debate started.  The Minister says he has sought to seek consensus rather than division in the House, but I have been asked why he is continuously trying to create a divide between survivors.  He needs to hear that going out of this Chamber tonight.  He needs to include it in the legislation he is bringing forward.  The Minister also said that the Government has gone significantly further, when he referred to what the Government has done.  They say that this is not far enough.  If they say that it is not far enough, it is not far enough.  The Minister said that this is the largest scheme of its kind in the history of the State, but they want to remind him that it is the largest and most inhumane scandal in the history of the State.  The Minister has to listen, even at this late stage.<\/p>  <p>  I want to remember tonight the tenacity and courage of Catherine Corless in uncovering the scandal of the 796 babies still in the sewage tanks in Tuam.

I do not have the time to fully express to the Minister the hurt, frustration and disbelief they have expressed to me.  I want to place on the record of the D&aacute;il some quotes from an open letter written by the survivors of the Castlepollard institution earlier this year.  It begins:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe sad fact is that losing a baby to forced adoption is a traumatic event in a mother's life causing a form of post traumatic stress disorder and it makes zero difference how soon after birth this trauma is inflicted; the horror remains, the depression, anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks ... <\/blockquote>  <p>The survivors make it clear in their open letter that &quot;the commission's final report is deeply flawed&quot;.  It continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tUp to 15,000 people in Ireland ... were illegally adopted during the timeframe under investigation and they were excluded ... they have spent their entire lives giving false, misleading and potentially lethal family medical histories to doctors and hospital staff. <\/blockquote>  <p>The letter further states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFurthermore the rest of the county homes were ignored by this commission - more than two dozen escaped investigation ...  Where is their truth and justice? <\/blockquote>  <p>It continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe listened to both Taoiseach Martin and T&aacute;naiste Varadkar apologise in the D&aacute;il today ...  Neither mentioned their own political parties nor their culpability in what is essentially Ireland's own little holocaust ... insult headed upon injury and salt thrown in the wounds by the empty seats ...  Apparently, it was 'society's fault'.  What was the point in our testifying if our word was to be doubted?  Our testimonies ARE the proof.<br \/><br \/>Neither of the sickening double act in the D&aacute;il today bothered to talk about real and immediate action for living survivors ... the living survivor community must take priority ... we need action while some of us are alive. <\/blockquote>  <p>These are the raw, hurt words of survivors, told in their own words in an open letter.  They have had enough of political waffle to last them more than a lifetime.  They have been failed time and again.  Actions, not words, are what is needed now, because people start to heal the moment they feel heard.  These survivors have yet to feel heard.  Do not deny them again.  I ask the Minister not to let that happen on his watch.  He must ensure that justice is finally delivered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300047#VV00500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1637699700,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank everybody who has been involved in the debate.  I welcome the fact that the motion is not being opposed.  Genuinely, the Minister and Minister of State have heard tonight that people want to work constructively.  That is why we brought this motion forward.  We want to highlight the issues.  I imagine that Government Deputies, like everyone else, were inundated with people asking why they were excluded from the scheme.  I do not believe that anybody, whether they stand in opposition or in government, wants to exclude anybody.  That is why we brought the motion forward.  I genuinely hope that there is sincerity when the Minister says that he wants to work with us and that he is not opposing the motion for that reason.  Everybody wants a scheme that will suit and that is fit for purpose.  <\/p> <p>As already stated, this has to be the D&aacute;il that finally deals with these issues because we have been talking about them for so long.  People are literally dying as we are debating them.  I reiterate what I said earlier.  A lot of this was left at the Minister's door by predecessors, who were probably happy enough to leave it there, but he now has an opportunity to deal with it properly and constructively and listen to people.<br\/><br\/>The letter that was written to the Minister was mentioned on a number of occasions.  Some of it has already been read out but I will read out two final points.  We should welcome that we have such experts to whom we can look, particularly when this matter comes to legislation and the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I am hoping that people like these will feed into that process and that we can base that legislation on some of their work.  It is excellent, as Deputy Connolly said, that they had the courage to come out with this letter at the weekend.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe are seeking a revision of the recommendations arising from the report, with inclusion of best practice guidelines regarding neuroscience, childhood trauma and attachment.  We are willing to work alongside you to see these changes through and want to meaningfully contribute to better practices, rather than simply criticising from the sidelines.<br \/><br \/>One final point.  These women and children have experienced complex trauma and adversity in their lives.  Yes, the money will help, there's no doubt about it.  But there is also an opportunity to right a wrong, to empathise at a human level and seek to understand.  We want to minimise the risk of secondary traumatisation and invalidation of survivors and their families which is most likely where experiences are not heard, respected and redressed.  Fundamentally it is about mothers, children and families being seen and heard and having their lived experiences validated.  Collectively we can surely strive for this?  <\/blockquote> <p>That perfectly sums up what we are trying to achieve with this motion.  These people are clinical psychologists and therapeutic social workers.  They work with children and understand trauma very well.  We should take their suggestions on board.  I think everybody would agree that this scheme has to be inclusive.  It should include all survivors, particularly as regards the medical card aspect.  An awful lot of women are being retraumatised by that because they were holding out and waiting for this enhanced medical card.  It is not right that they would be denied it.  Interim payments should also be looked at and that is being examined in the Six Counties as part of their report.<br\/><br\/>There will be statements on this matter again on Thursday so we will be discussing the topic again.  I thank people for their support on this motion.  I send solidarity and support to all survivors who were sent to institutions, anybody who was born there and their families.  I know it retraumatises them every time we talk about it but it is important to raise the issues.  I am thinking of all the people I have met, and who we have all met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300047#VV00600","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637700300,"counter":294,"content":"<p>The debate having concluded, I must deal first with amendment No. 1 in the name of Solidarity-People Before Profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300048#WW00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1637700300,"counter":295,"content":"<p>To be absolutely clear, our amendment will now be an addition.

My Department has always been guided by public health advice on appropriate Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures in our schools.  These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are effective.  Public health advice is that the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are ensuring no one with new onset symptoms attends school and all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans.<\/p>  <p>  Each school was provided with an updated Covid-19 response plan in advance of the return to school.  Significant additional resources of &euro;639 million were put into schools in the previous academic year to keep schools safe.  Further funding of &euro;57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in September for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term alone.  This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, personal protective equipment, PPE, requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision.<\/p>  <p>  At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for principals and deputy principals.  Teacher supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide, and a recent review saw an additional 100 teaching posts added, resulting in approximately 480 teaching posts on these panels available to provide substitute cover in schools  At post-primary level, more than 1,000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students, and to ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom.  This funding also included additional posts for guidance provision.<\/p>  <p>  Managing ventilation is also an important part of the measures to keep our schools safe.  Updated guidance for schools on practical steps for the deployment of good ventilation practices in schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing Covid-19.  The Department's guidance is clear that where the recommended measures have been undertaken and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with the other methods of ventilation that are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300049#XX00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1637700900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>We all want schools to be open and functioning well but we cannot pretend Covid-19 is not in our schools.

If education remaining open is as important as we say it is, surely we should be throwing the kitchen sink at it.  While I acknowledge the ventilation measures the Minister has outlined, CO2 monitors alone are not enough to ensure schools remain open safely and functioning well.  It is crunch time and I am urging the Minister to go back to her Department and seriously examine the role HEPA filters can play here.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants HEPA filter systems in all classrooms and the Government needs to resource schools to put them in place.  This would cost less than &euro;30 million.

Equally, in terms of ventilation we have been very clear at every point that if there are issues with ventilation, they can and will be addressed.  Public health officials have been very clear in telling us that natural ventilation is the most important type of ventilation, but where there are specific issues with a vent or a window or more substantial issues, we have a technical team available to schools.

Many school staff are concerned by the details of the antigen testing plan.  They are rightly asking what protections, in the context of antigen testing, are in place for them.  Given school staff are not part of classroom pods, is there is any possibility of staff receiving antigen tests?  There are further concerns about delays between children being identified as pod close contacts and receiving antigen tests in the post.  The advice is children should continue to go to school unless they have a positive antigen test.  This means children who may have Covid-19 may continue to attend school for days while waiting for antigen tests in the post.  What has the Minister done to ensure rapid access to antigen testing?

The review involved a broad range of research, consultations, and communications with a broad range of stakeholders, including very importantly, students themselves, on all aspects of review and redevelopment.

I would not usually advocate this, but given that we are in a state of emergency, surely it is time to identify some of these teachers and for them to return back to the classroom.  Principals are under incredible pressure to find substitute cover.  Sometimes they have no other option but to deploy a special education teacher to cover a mainstream class.  This is not by choice but by necessity.  Last year, schools were able to bank those special education hours to protect special education teaching time for children with additional needs.  I cannot understand why this year, when the substitution crisis has deteriorated even further, that banking is no longer an option.  This is one thing the Minister can do immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300050#YY01000","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1637701500,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I want to be very clear.

The approach to supporting schools to operate safely during Covid-19 has been to follow and implement public health advice.  A range of measures have been implemented across schools, including social distancing, enhanced cleaning and, as the Deputy will be aware, mask wearing in some settings for students and in all settings for staff.<\/p>  <p>  As of 27 September 2021, following a recommendation from NPHET, a decision was taken to cease routine contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts in children older than three months to under 13 years outside the household setting, including those attending primary educational and childcare settings.  Contact tracing continues for those over 13 years, including those attending post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are still required to undertake the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses by ensuring no one with new acute symptoms attends class and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education, announced last week a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools when a case of Covid-19 arises.  Parents and guardians of a primary school child who is a confirmed case of Covid-19 following a PCR test are asked to inform their school principal.  The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case.  Where there are two cases in a class in more than one pod in a seven- day period, antigen tests will be offered to every child in the class.  Of course, no personal details of the child will be shared.  These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a PCR \"detected\" test for Covid-19.  By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly.  It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this new programme.  It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing.  Children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school whether they participate in antigen testing or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300051#ZZ00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1637702100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>The Minister might not be aware but I actually brought antigen testing to NPHET in April or May 2020 and I am somebody who has been promoting this technology for quite a while.  The antigen test for infectiousness is very important and we are probably being too slow about rolling it out given the way we are proposing to roll it out.  I accept it has limitations in terms of its effectiveness, whether it is in a managed setting or in a less formal setting.  However, as I said in the House recently, I have a sister-in-law who works as a school secretary in the UK, where that school is managing antigen testing for all of the school&rsquo;s 900 pupils and doing it very successfully, with two antigen tests for all school pupils every week.  This is something we should be looking at.  The problem here is that the horse will have bolted while we are trying to close the stable door in many cases, given what we are proposing.  For that reason, although maybe it is difficult considering the Minister is referencing health advice, I suggest that what we are proposing is not significant enough and not often enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300051#ZZ00700","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1637702100,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

As new evidence becomes available, as we have found throughout Covid, the implementation of measures and the recommendations are altered.  We now have the expert view of the CMO who, having reviewed the evidence, believes there is a role for antigen testing in our schools, but he is very clear to say it is merely an additional tool and it will be seen and implemented in that respect.

I think that is a mistake.<\/p>  <p>  The other thing I would point out to the Minister is that there is a significant cost differential between PCR testing and antigen testing, probably at a rate of 10:1.  Therefore, it suggests we could be doing a lot of antigen testing for the large amount of money that we are spending.<\/p>  <p>  I want to offer the Minister one other piece of advice for teachers, if I may.  There is now a lot of evidence that supports the supplementation of vitamin D.  Despite the fact that, again, NPHET and the CMO will not endorse this, I can tell the Minister most medics in the country are supplementing vitamin D.  I would ask that this message goes out to teachers at the moment.  We live in a northern latitude country.  We are not making enough vitamin D and there is a significant correlation between adverse Covid and low levels of vitamin D.

I wish to advise the Deputy that the Department is aware of increasing local pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas, including the mid-west Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by a number of different factors, as the Deputy will be aware.  In some instances, it could be duplication of applications where pupils may apply for a place to a number of schools in the area; pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school or school of choise while there are places in other schools in the area; some towns or areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils; and there is the external draw, with pupils coming from outside the local area.  I reference these as sometimes causing specific issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Dublin Mid-West, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train.<\/p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this area and others will reduce in the short term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.<\/p>  <p>  The capital programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.

The provision of PE halls and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school.  The Department provides general purpose rooms and PE halls with the construction of all new primary and post-primary schools, respectively.  These facilities may also be provided where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s design guidelines for all new schools provide for outdoor multi-use games areas, in other words, hard play areas, and the level of play space provided varies with the size of the school.  For example, a new 24-classroom primary school with special educational needs classes is provided with three ball courts, two junior play areas as well as a secure hard and soft play area and a 100 sq. m sensory garden.

The Department's investment includes providing for in excess of 400 home school community liaison co-ordinators, in the region of &euro;16 million in DEIS grants, additional posts for DEIS band 1 primary schools, curriculum supports, enhanced book grants, and access to the school completion programme.  This year's package follows an extensive body of work that has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools.<\/p> <p>This work involved an initial process of consultation between the Department and the education partners on the technical aspects of the model.  The purpose of the consultation is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.<\/p> <p> Under DEIS plan 2017, the DEIS identification process is based on an objective statistics-based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme.  An extensive body of work has been undertaken by the DEIS technical group on developing the defined model.  The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the Department of Education primary online database, the post-primary online databases and Central Statistics Office, CSO, data from the national census of population as represented in the Pobal HP deprivation index for small areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300055#DDD01400","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637705100,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I am aware of the DEIS review that is being undertaken, but I want Carlow and Tullow to be included in it.

There is a crisis for many families.  I do not use that word lightly.  It is not just an issue in north Dublin.  Many of my colleagues across different constituencies in Dublin, Wexford and in Drogheda tell me the same thing.  Colleagues of mine, John Nisbet, in Dublin North-West, Senator Marie Sherlock in Dublin North-Central, Deputy Duncan Smith in Dublin Fingal, and people in my constituency, Dublin Bay North, are talking about it.  My colleague, Senator Mark Wall, from Kildare, raised it in the Seanad yesterday.  There is a crisis with access to second level school places.  Primary level is an issue too.  We have discussed the provisions in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 for 25% of places to be kept aside for children or grandchildren of past pupils.  That has now gone to Committee Stage in the Oireachtas education committee and we can discuss that.<\/p>  <p>  It has been suggested to me that the level of social mobility around the time of the housing crash 12 or 13 years ago is part of the issue here because many families moved into areas they were not originally from.  Their children are now reaching second level school age and so this problem is arising.  For whatever reason, my office has never had the level of contact we have had in recent months about issues of accessing second level schools across the northside.  These children have to be taught and to go to second level.  We are now at a stage where panic is creeping in.  The Minister can appreciate that being in primary school for the past years has been difficult with the pandemic.  Young people want the security of knowing what secondary schools they will attend.  Parents want to know too.  It is becoming an acute problem in my constituency.  Unfortunately, I do not have answers for these parents who contact my office.  I suggest they go through the enrolment policy of the school and try to engage with the school in whatever way they can, but they tell me they are on different waiting lists for different schools.<\/p>  <p>  I am also told there can sometimes be a general data protection regulation, GDPR, issue with sharing data about who is on which list.  A number of parents may have their children on a number of different lists.  It is not always obvious how many places are necessary for a cohort of young people.  There is a parallel issue with the choice of patronage.  If people have been educated through Irish until sixth class and would therefore choose an Irish-language medium second level school, that has its own challenges.  If people have been taught with the Educate Together ethos until sixth class, they will prefer that type of schooling.  Either way, my constituents face the crisis of not having any notion of where their children will go for first year of secondary school next year.<\/p>  <p>  What analysis has the Department done of this issue in north Dublin or farther afield, in areas I have referred to?

It gives me the opportunity to set out for the House the position with regard to post-primary places in north Dublin for September 2022 and onwards.  To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where increasing school place requirements and associated accommodation needs will arise.  However, it is important to note that where local enrolment pressures emerge, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by a number of factors, individually or collectively.  One is duplication of applications, where pupils have applied for a place at a number of schools in the area.  Another is school choice, when pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town or area.  Some towns or areas have single-sex schools, and while places are available in the school, they are not available to all pupils.  There is also the external draw, with pupils coming from outside the local area.  One or a combination of these factors may be involved.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is working with relevant school authorities to establish the extent of enrolment pressures.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in north Dublin, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train.  Where it is determined additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the school sector to meet demographic and other demands.  The capital programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.  It is expected the enrolment pressures in north Dublin and in other areas will reduce in the short term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.  With regard to projects, there has been significant investment under the major capital programme in the north Dublin area in recent years.  Bremore Educate Together, Balbriggan has a new school building for 1,000 pupils, which was completed in 2018.  Col&aacute;iste Ghl&oacute;r na Mara, also in Balbriggan, was completed in 2019 and also has accommodation for 1,000 pupils.  In addition, there are 13 other major projects at post-primary level in the north Dublin area, including at Belmayne, Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords, Dublin 15 and Rush, which are at various stages of the design and build process and will greatly contribute to the supply of school places in the area.<\/p>  <p>  The capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified.  Included among additional accommodation projects are Dominican College, Drumcondra, Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laigh, Coolock and Santa Sabina Dominican College, Sutton.  Clonturk Community College has had a significant amount of modular accommodation approved to cater for its needs.  St. Aidan's, Whitehall has been approved for a significant project, which has been devolved to the school authorities for delivery.  The Department is also engaging with school authorities at Castleknock Community College and Luttrellstown Community College to consider their accommodation needs.  I can assure the Deputy that the Department is working intensively to ensure there is sufficient post-primary school accommodation available throughout the country, including in north Dublin, to meet school place requirements in every area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300058#GGG00500","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1637706300,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her reply.

In line with a strengthened approach in recent years, the process involves specific initiatives such as enhanced engagement with local authorities, which is hugely important, and information on residential development because clearly, as the Deputy will appreciate, where houses go education goes as well.  There is additional engagement with patron bodies in regard to their local knowledge on school place requirements and with education and training boards, diocesan offices, national patron bodies such as Educate Together and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, etc.  They can also be an important source of knowledge.

I was advised over six weeks ago that there were 28 children on a waiting list for vital medical devices such as wheelchairs and, in one particular case, a device required to assist a young person in regard to speech development.  My understanding was that there were a total of 28 children on that waiting list as of the start of October 2021.  In October, I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health.  As a result, funding was made available, as I understand it, for devices to be provided for ten children.<\/p>  <p>  In the parliamentary question I asked specifically about CHO 4 and CHO 5.  CHO 4 is the Cork-Kerry region and CHO 5 is the Carlow-Kilkenny region.  The reply I received from the HSE was to the effect that there is no waiting list in CHO 5, but in regard to CHO 4, the Cork-Kerry area, the reply states that the HSE sincerely regrets that there can be a waiting time for important equipment such as wheelchairs, in some cases, but that this is due to circumstances beyond its control, such as long lead times when ordering from manufacturers and that in other cases, the funding available to it does not meet the demand.  Why is there discrimination between children who are living in, say, Mitchelstown and children living in, say, Cork city?  If one is living in Mitchelstown one could be waiting for up to 12 months for equipment whereas if one is living in Cahir there is no waiting list.  That is total discrimination.  I have raised this here with the Taoiseach as well in the past two weeks.  He advised that there is adequate funding within the HSE.  I understand that there is an underspend in some departments and that &euro;60,000 would resolve the problem for the medical devices that are required for the remaining 18 children.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that this funding will be provided prior to 31 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300059#HHH00400","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1637706900,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Burke for the opportunity to address the issue of the provision of medical aids and appliances, including wheelchairs, by the Health Service Executive in the Cork-Kerry region.  I heard the Deputy raise the issue with the Taoiseach the week before last.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides a wide range of medical and surgical aids and appliances, including wheelchairs, free of charge to eligible persons such as medical card holders and people on the long-term illness scheme following assessment by a relevant health professional.  These appliances and aids are provided by the HSE through community services known as community funded schemes.  These products and services play a key role in assisting and supporting people to maintain everyday functioning and to remain living in their homes and their local communities.  They also avoid the need for a hospital presentation or admission when facilitating early discharge from hospital back into the community. <\/p>  <p>  Each community health organisation, CHO, operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances.  Each application within a CHO is assessed for eligible persons by the local resource allocation group.  A determination is made regarding approval based on priority and funding available within local budgets.  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items provided through the medical and surgical aids and appliances budget in a particular CHO.  CHOs undertake a range of initiatives to ensure optimum use of resources, including, for example, through the efficient recycling of stock items such as wheelchairs and walking aids.  <\/p>  <p>  In CHO 4, the Cork-Kerry area, there is currently a waiting list in place for the purchase of some wheelchairs.  While additional funding was recently allocated in CHO 4, to which the Deputy alluded, the effects of Brexit and the global issues with the supply chain have further impacted the sourcing of appropriate wheelchairs for some applicants.  The HSE is currently trying to resolve these issues and to source the wheelchairs in as timely a manner as possible.  It should also be noted more generally that the waiting times vary depending on the priority rating and that the rating is made by healthcare professionals based on clinical risk.  Priority is given to individuals with the greatest level of clinical need.  <\/p>  <p>  At national level in the HSE, a national service improvement programme has been established with the aim of improving the quality and sustainability of the community funded schemes through the establishment of national standards.  These standards will be based on evidence-based rationale and will include a list of approved items, national prescribing guidelines and clinical criteria for each.<\/p> <p>This should improve equality of access, value for money and functional processes.  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed progress on this programme but, as the situation improves, it will gather pace.  It is important to note that section 6 of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300059#HHH00500","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637707500,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.

I acknowledge the message I had from the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, that she could not attend the debate.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the current wave of Covid infections, our hospitality and night-time entertainment sector is once again at the forefront of the response.  Many people are changing their plans, as has been acknowledged today by the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and the sector is bearing the brunt of that.  To give an example, I am aware of a small restaurant that has had 2,324 cancellations in the past two weeks.  That is being replicated right across the country in restaurants, hotels, nightclubs, theatres and music venues.  A specific response is needed to the situation they face in the coming weeks.  These are not just any weeks; the weeks that make up the Christmas period sustain the hospitality and night-time entertainment industry through the quiet months of January, February and March.  The money that is earned now pays the bills during that time and allows businesses to build up again.  The current situation requires a specific response, including a commitment to extend the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, to sustain businesses through the period.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a need for a firmer discussion around the response to where hospitality finds itself at this stage in the Covid crisis.  Are we serious about hospitality in Ireland or are we taking it for granted?  Are we gong to invest in training for the industry to provide the skills that are needed?  Is the view prevailing, as has been expressed by some members of the Government in recent times, that there are loads of jobs in the industry, even though that does not recognise the skills needed within the sector?  People cannot simply be moved around and skills are being lost to the industry.  Employees are moving out of hospitality, tourism and late-night entertainment into other areas of the economy.  Their skills will be lost and cannot easily be replaced.  When international and domestic travel comes back, when we eventually put Covid behind us and once again look to tourism, hospitality and late-night entertainment to rebuild our lives, those skills will be gone.<\/p>  <p>  We need a specific, tailored package in place for late-night entertainment specialists, including sound and music technicians.  We also need a package of key employee supports in order that restaurants and hotels can retain employees such as chefs, whose skills are limited but necessary.  They need to be retained within the hospitality industry.  I know of chefs who have moved into catering in manufacturing, manufacturing itself or retail because there is certainty around employment.  There must be an immediate response to the particular crisis being faced by hospitality and night-time entertainment, which is occurring as we speak.  I referred to cancellations for the Christmas period, which include cancellations of late-night events.  We also need a whole-of-government response that will put hospitality on a new setting, make it ready for a post-Covid world and ensure the skills are in place to make it an attractive sector in which to work.  The industry also must respond by providing certainty and offering wages that are fair, decent and reflective of the modern economy.  However, it cannot do that on its own.  A partnership approach is needed.<\/p>  <p>  I have been saying for a long time that we need some sort of specific training mechanism, such as that provided in the past by CERT.  In its time, it did a wonderful job of providing training, preparing people for careers and offering life skills for workers in the hospitality and night-time entertainment industry.  It is time we had a commitment once again to a body such as CERT.  I look forward to a response from the Government.  We will not have instant solutions this evening but there needs to be an awareness of how urgent the situation is for the many thousands of people employed in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300060#JJJ00600","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1637707500,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to address the House on this matter this evening.  As he is aware, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, was unable to attend and asked me to stand in on her behalf.  I want to start by acknowledging on a personal level that the challenges being faced by our hospitality and entertainment sectors, both currently and over the previous months, are severe.  It is a difficult time for many, particularly those working in these industries.  As a Government, we recognise the difficulties and are doing everything we can to support these important industries.  While the ongoing public health situation is continually evolving and a recent deterioration saw the introduction last week of a requirement for Covid-19 passes for cinemas and theatres, as well as a midnight closing time for all on-licensed premises, we are optimistic these measures will allow businesses to keep operating and keep people at work.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been actively working with the tourism and hospitality sector to ensure it is properly supported.  The significant additional funding secured for tourism services in budget 2022 will help to address immediate survival-related concerns while also enabling further resilience and recovery across the industry as we reopen to international tourism and transition to a more sustainable future.  The Deputy referred to the situation for the domestic tourism sector by instancing the case of a single restaurant having nearly 2,400 cancellations.  That is a phenomenal blow to any business.  The funding for tourism in budget 2022, amounting to &euro;288.5 million, represents an increase of &euro;67.6 million over the 2021 allocation.  It includes &euro;50 million for further tourism business continuity supports to assist strategic tourism businesses with their survival and recovery.  The 2022 funding is in addition to the &euro;55 million in tourism business continuity supports that were made available this year.  By the end of the year, hundreds of tourism businesses will have received vital funding to help them survive the impacts of the pandemic and hundreds more will again receive support in the coming year.  In addition, a further &euro;35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund has been secured in 2022 to enable Tourism Ireland to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to restore inbound tourism to Ireland.  A sum of &euro;36.5 million is also being provided in capital funding for tourism product development for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences, in line with the objectives of the national development plan. <\/p>  <p>  The supports for tourism also include a range of cross-government measures to assist the sector.<\/p> <p>Tourism enterprises continue to benefit from measures such as the continuation of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Every hotelier and person operating restaurants whom I have met has said to me that the scheme was a lifeline for their business over the previous months.  It kept employees connected to the business.  It helped them to be able to continue.  Some of them mentioned the rates rebates they received when they were closed as a key factor for those who had a rateable premises.  The tax warehousing for commercial rates and the 9% VAT rate for hospitality remain in place until September 2022.  <\/p> <p> We also had a number of other programmes in place, such as the &euro;25 million live performance support scheme, the &euro;16 million events sector Covid-19 support scheme, the &euro;10 million local private performance support scheme, the &euro;4 million music and entertainment support scheme, the &euro;5 million commercial entertainment capital grant and the &euro;1 million provided for the St. Patrick's Day festival.  There are no certainties with this virus, but the Government will continue to engage with stakeholders in a positive way to ensure the relevant concerns are addressed in the decision-making process.  The Government wants to continue to support this sector and ensure it is given the opportunity to thrive again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300060#JJJ00700","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1637708100,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Many of the commitments are welcome.  The sector acknowledges the support that has been received and the importance of that support.  Many commitments the Minister of State mentioned are macro.  They are for the overall industry.  It is essential that we have commitments very soon that the EWSS and the CRSS will be continued after 1 December at their current rates.  The VAT level changes on 31 August ahead of September.  It seems rather silly to have two different VAT years for one calendar year, particularly in tourism and hospitality.  Ireland is growing a reputation for autumn and early winter tourism.  The industry does not have the certainty to market that.  It needs certainty.  As I said, no small business could sustain 50% cancellation rates in two weeks.  The cancellations had begun before the restrictions to which the Minister of State referred were announced.  They began with the overall messaging that was coming from NPHET in particular.  The cancellations affect restaurants, pubs, Christmas parties, events and concerts.  The musicians to whom the Minister of State referred are being absolutely hammered because their ticket sales have been cancelled.  They need an urgent response in the coming days and weeks.  Many of the supports the Minister of State mentioned are macro.  The industry may not be there to benefit from them unless we get a response in place.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the EWSS should be expanded to protect key employees within hospitality, such as a chef, a particular barman or a skilled technician within an events company.  The link between that company and the employee, as the Minister of State said, should be protected.  The link between a company and a particularly valued employee should especially be protected.  That is the basis on which we regrow and rebuild the industry.

I outlined the provisions that were made at national level across the sector.  Each one of them worked its way down to individual people who are involved in the industry.  I mentioned the global name for each of the schemes, but every one of them had a positive impact on many people on the ground.  It takes time for those schemes to work their way down through the system, but this has been done.<\/p>  <p>   Everybody now recognises that many people are back at work.  Some 90% of people who were on the PUP earlier in the year are now back at work.  In the days, weeks and months ahead, the focus has to be on the specific sectors that are now affected more than others as a result of Covid-19.  Everything we talk about now has to be geared towards specific sectors.  Large sections of the economy are back to normal again.  I met many business owners in the last couple of weeks who said that despite everything, they have had a reasonably good year.  However, that certainly does not include this sector.  That is why it has to be has supported specifically.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned issues such as the key employee support scheme.  Such issues, along with training for the industry, need to be examined to make sure core people are in place such that when tourism fully reopens next year when Covid-19 is behind us, we are not short of staff and we are not looking outside the country for people to come in and give people their c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.<\/p>  <p>  The tourism VAT rate does not hold for the full year.  However, it is designed to get us over the tourism season, which was the main element.  I am sure that topic will come up for discussion in the period ahead again.  I thank the Deputy for raising that.  The people had commenced the cancellations before the Government made the announcement.  Many people would have been hesitant about going out, regardless of whether the Government closed down or introduced the midnight restriction.

I commend the Mental Health Commission on its stark report, Access to Mental Health Services for People in the Criminal Justice System.  When I first submitted this matter to the Ceann Comhairle, I was asked to clarify which Department it was going to.  I was not sure if it would go to the Department of Health or the Department of Justice.  Therefore, some of my questions and input will be related to the Department of Justice.  This highlights the fact that there needs to be a cross-departmental approach when it comes to mental health.  The Minister of State probably knows that better than anybody.<\/p>  <p>  I attended the launch of the report, along with the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on justice, Deputy Martin Kenny, last week.  It is clear that what we have heard anecdotally over the years has been solidified in the report by the inspector of mental health services, Dr. Susan Finnerty.  In fact, what is contained in this report is far more serious than any of us imagined.  Those who commit crimes while acutely mentally ill are essentially being warehoused in our prison services, often in solitary confinement with little or no supports to rehabilitate them.  This failure, in turn, is having a negative impact on rates of reoffending.  If a serious mental health difficulty, such as acute psychosis, is the root cause of an offence, what hope is there for rehabilitation when the prisoner cannot access basic mental health services?<\/p>  <p>  The end results often lead to reoffending upon release, which also leads to an increase in victims.  This vicious cycle has been perpetuated by successive Governments' lack of investment and resource planning in both the Irish Prison Service and mental health services in the wider community.  As part of our alternative budget, we called for a significant investment in prison services, which would allow for additional spending on staffing, rehabilitation and health services.  We need reform for the safety of staff and prisoners and to reduce the potential for reoffending.  Ireland has one of the highest reoffending rates across Europe.  Much of that is due to low levels of funding for basic services.<\/p>  <p>  I am interested in Dr. Finnerty's call for diversion programmes for people who offend as a direct result of serious mental health difficulty.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and I wholeheartedly support this call, which brings me to my first question.  Does the Government have any plans for diversion programmes for people with mental health issues who find themselves in the judicial system?<\/p>  <p>  We speak to the stakeholders in community all the time.  We are well aware of the faults in the system.  We will continue to support communities to correct the wrongs in a broken system that criminalises a person who is unwell.  For too long, the Irish justice system has been the gatekeeper for those experiencing mental health difficulties.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is often the first group to respond to someone who is having a mental health crisis in our communities.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the pilot project that will begin in Limerick in the new year.  It is mentioned in the report.  It will see the establishment of a crisis de-escalation team that will treat someone who is having a mental health difficulty in the community.  Along with my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, I have been calling for this approach to be adopted.  We would like to see it replicated across the State.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the conditions that mentally ill people are experiencing in our prisons at present are inhumane.  There is no parity of esteem between a prisoner&rsquo;s mental health and his or her physical health.  For example, if a prisoner is suffering from a physical health issue, he or she will be removed from the prison and treated accordingly.  This report has proven that the same treatment is not given to prisoners experiencing mental health problems.  We will continue to support calls for diversion programmes for people who are mentally unwell.  We will support communities that experience these issues and have clearly been forgotten by successive Governments.  What learnings have been taken by the Government from this report?  Will it start taking a cross-departmental approach?  Are there any plans for diversion projects for those in front of the judicial system?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300061#KKK00500","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1637708700,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ward for raising this important matter.  I was happy to stay late tonight to answer it because it is so important.  The Deputy was not wrong when he said it was a stark report and it does require a cross-departmental approach.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and I welcome this recent report by the Mental Health Commission, recognising the vital role it plays in supporting and assisting us in developing and improving our mental health services overall.  The report presents a realistic picture of the various challenges faced by people with mental health difficulties in the criminal justice system.  These include issues that extend beyond the capacity of specialist mental health services and require input from other sectors, such as primary care, addiction and homeless services.  I met with Dr. Susan Finnerty, the author of the report, and John Farrelly, the chief executive of the Mental Health Commission, earlier this month prior to the report's publication.  We had a constructive discussion on many of the report's findings.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the Government remains firmly committed to continuing to improve forensic mental health services, as reflected in various commitments under the programme for Government, Sharing the Vision and in the significant new investment that has been provided to the development of the National Forensic Mental Health Service.  Both the opening of the new forensic mental health facility in Portrane and the development of a high-level interdepartmental task force to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of people in the criminal justice system are specific commitments under the programme for Government.  That task force has been up and running for the past six months.  It is chaired by Kathleen Lynch, who was formerly a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.  The task force will develop a report in early 2022 and will propose a high-level implementation plan for any required actions arising.<\/p>  <p>  The issues under consideration by the task force include diversion of individuals with addiction and mental health difficulties away from the criminal justice system.  Three subcommittees have been set up to look at the issues of diversion, the capacity of the Irish Prison Service and the National Forensic Mental Health Service, and community issues, including throughcare from custody.  When I met with Kathleen Lynch, we discussed the fact a person might be exiting prison on a Friday evening with nowhere to go.  He or she does not have a medical card.  If that person has mental health difficulties, we will be recommending, or I hope we will be recommending, that he or she has some place to stay and has, at minimum, a medical card and an apportionment with a mental health consultant or medical person within seven days.  That is what we need to stop the revolving door.  That high-level interdepartmental task force has been operational for the past six months and is doing a huge amount of work.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, everyone who is committed to prison is subject to a comprehensive medical assessment by the prison healthcare team, which can include, as appropriate, a mental health assessment.  This is used to develop an individual healthcare plan for the person while in custody.  Where necessary, individuals are referred to a forensic clinician or prison service psychologist, or both.  In-reach mental health services are provided by the HSE's National Forensic Mental Health Service, involving the provision of weekly forensic mental health sessions.  However, we heard from Dr. Finnerty that these services are a postcode lottery and can be better in some areas than others, so that is something we have to look at as well.  The Deputy is quite right in what he said.  The Minister for Justice could be answering these questions as well but I am looking at it purely from a mental health perspective, and that is the side of it we are trying to drive on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300062#LLL00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1637708700,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I understand that.  It is one of those things that falls between a couple of stools.  There is not a debate in this Chamber where mental health is not mentioned.  There is not a decision made at the Cabinet table, good, bad or indifferent, that does not have an impact on people's mental health.  Good decisions will impact people mentally and bad decisions will have an adverse effect.  When I was thinking about this earlier, I wondered where this debate could go.  We could bring in health, justice, social protection, education and housing.  The reasons people end up in the judicial system go right across the spectrum, so a cross-departmental approach is worth looking into.<\/p>  <p>  I did not see this mentioned in the report but there is a service within the prison system called the community prisons links programme.  Workers are sent in to help people who have addiction issues and mental health issues or a dual diagnosis.  It is like what the Minister of State was calling for, where they make sure that when people leave, their payments are set up, they have somewhere to go and have their basic needs met so they are less likely to reoffend and go back in.  Maybe that is something that could be expanded as part of the report.<\/p>  <p>  On the report itself, prisoners and those in the community who have a forensic history must have the same access to quality mental healthcare as the general population.  That needs to be a must as part of the report.  The report also stated the commission welcomed the pilot crisis intervention team that is going to be rolled out in Limerick.  I am looking forward to it.  It could be a game changer in access to 24-7 emergency mental healthcare.  Is that still on track for early next year?  Will the Minister of State give me an update on what it will entail?  I also ask her to elaborate on this cross-departmental approach between the Departments of Justice and Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300062#LLL00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1637708700,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I appreciate the constructive approach the Deputy has taken to this matter.  Sharing the Vision is clear that people with mental health difficulties in the criminal justice system should have access to mental health services equal to that of the general population.  Everybody is agreed on that.  Many of the recommendations made in this report are reflected in Sharing the Vision and Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sharing the Vision recommendations include opening the new forensic mental health unit in Portrane, the development of intensive care rehabilitation units and psychiatric intensive care units nationally, and improving diversion, which is very important, to reduce the number of people with mental health difficulties within the criminal justice system.  Implementation of Sharing the Vision is being driven by the independent national implementation and monitoring committee.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Sharing the Vision, I have requested, and am committed to, an acute bed capacity review for mental health services.  This review has commenced and will help address the capacity issues in our forensic mental health services.  It will provide us with the necessary data on forensic mental health capacity, as well as data for communities and departments of psychiatry throughout the country.  I am looking forward to that report.  It is being worked on by the national implementation and monitoring committee and three subcommittees have been set up, so I thank them for the work they are doing in the background.  There is a lot of work under way at the moment.  We have one subcommittee on the bed capacity review, one on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the waiting lists, and one on support for minority groups, the Traveller and Roma communities and women with mental health issues.  A lot of work is under way.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's specific question, my understanding is that pilot is on target and a cross-departmental approach is being taken.  I will check that out for him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021112300062#LLL00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1637708700,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.58 p.m. until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 November 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
