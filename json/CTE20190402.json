My key focus for 2019 is protecting vulnerable farm incomes, supporting sustainable farming and jobs in rural and coastal communities, and assisting the sector in meeting the challenges of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.6 billion.  This comprises &euro;1.341 billion in current expenditure and &euro;277 million in capital expenditure, including a &euro;22 million capital carryover.  This represents an overall increase of &euro;31 million over last year when carryovers are taken into account.  Regarding our 2018 performance, I note that expenditure was &euro;1.546 billion.  Almost 99% of the current allocation was spent, reflecting a very strong delivery of crucial supports to the agrifood sector.  As members may recall, our allocation for 2018 included a &euro;30 million supplementary allocation which provided additional funding for measures introduced last autumn to alleviate the fodder situation.  I thank my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the European Commission for support given last year when we were presented with unprecedented difficulties by weather impacts on farmers.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that we meet today at a very uncertain and challenging time for the agrifood and fisheries sector.  If a no-deal Brexit emerges, I am confident that the Government and our colleagues in Europe will not be found wanting in responding to the needs of our sector.  However, the Estimate I present to the committee today is as set out in the 2019 Revised Estimates as published in December 2018, which were framed for a Brexit scenario presuming implementation of the withdrawal agreement.<\/p> <p>  I will now speak about each of the four programmes and the key themes.  Programme A shows a substantial increase in pay and non-pay administrative allocations.  This reflects the allocation to this programme of the vast majority of the Department&rsquo;s additional funding for what is termed a \"central case Brexit scenario\".  This covers preparations for the additional checks on east&ndash;west trade, including the associated development of IT systems and equipment.  Obviously, this will be adapted to any change in circumstances that may arise in the weeks ahead.<\/p> <p>  I am providing for a substantial increase in programme expenditure, which includes additional funding for the meat inspection service.  This relates to a new arrangement recently agreed between my Department and Veterinary Ireland regarding the engagement of temporary veterinary inspectors.  I have provided a once-off sum of &euro;4 million in additional funding to support the introduction of sheep electronic identification, EID, with funding both for producers and to provide readers for marts.  I am also providing additional funding for ERAD, recognising that even with good progress in many aspects of the tuberculosis, TB, programme, we have seen a slight rise in herd incidence rates.  The work of the TB forum will be very instructive as to the ways and means to achieve our ambitious goal of eradication by 2030.<\/p> <p>  Turning to programme B, a total of &euro;863 million is available in 2019 to be paid almost exclusively to farmers, with &euro;640 million allocated to EU co&ndash;funded rural development programme, RDP, schemes.  That is in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion in funding from the EU for Pillar 1, the basic payment scheme.  These figures reflect the mature level of RDP implementation.  The allocation for our agri-environment schemes is lower than 2018, at just over &euro;228 million.  The reason for this is that an exceptionally high level of expenditure in 2018 of &euro;232 million on the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and a further &euro;22 million on other schemes succeeded in removing the large hangover of 2017 scheme payments and paying the vast majority their 2018 advance payments, hence reducing the funding requirement for 2019.  The agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, are now virtually completed with only some residual payments due.<\/p> <p>  This support to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits is vital.  As well as the inherent environmental benefits involved, this investment enhances our sustainability credentials, which are invaluable as we serve increasingly demanding and knowledgeable customers at home and around the world.  In that regard the allocations for organic farming schemes and locally led schemes are increasing.  We will be investing in three highly significant local schemes concerning the pearl mussel, the hen harrier and Burren farming in 2019, as well as a number of smaller and even more localised schemes.  This work is very much in sync with the objectives of the recently published report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action and the whole-of-Government approach to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.<\/p> <p>  We have increased the allocation to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme by a further &euro;23 million to &euro;250 million, restoring the scheme to pre-downturn levels.  This year is the first year of the new ANC scheme, with land eligibility now designated according to biophysical criteria.  The redesignation process has been lengthy and forensic and it arrived at a very reasonable outcome.  On budget day I described this latest increase as a very important part of building our Brexit resilience by giving invaluable direct financial support to farmers with land in the many naturally constrained parts of the country.  The average ANC payment of approximately &euro;2,500 will be an important part of income for producers, many of whom are farming in challenging circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Another element of our Brexit response for 2019 is included in the B6 subhead, namely, beef sustainability schemes.  This now includes both the well-established beef genomics and data programme, BDGP, and the new beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP.  For 2019, the pilot has been allocated &euro;20 million for farmer payments and another &euro;1 million for weighing equipment.  I am pleased that the application process for BEEP went smoothly and has attracted a very good level of applications.  It will offer an immediate income boost for participants and provide practical guidance for the future viability of our suckler herds.<\/p><p>It will complement very well the BDGP, for which &euro;46.5 million will be available in 2019.  I have also increased the allocation for knowledge transfer to &euro;25 million for the third year of the three-year programme.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the sheep sector, the sheep welfare scheme allocation for 2019 at &euro;18 million will provide for the balancing payment from the 2018 scheme year and the advance payments for the 2019 scheme year.  As I have mentioned already, under programme A I have provided more than &euro;3 million for payments to farmers for sheep EID.  The new system will significantly reduce record keeping for farmers and will result in a simpler and more effective sheep traceability system.<br\/><br\/>In terms of capital expenditure, I have maintained the allocation of &euro;70 million for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  I expect this to be fully spent as payment claims are being submitted on an ongoing basis, with more than &euro;20 million paid already this year.  Despite the uncertainty the sector faces, many farmers recognise the value of upgrading their equipment and improving their facilities, and we will continue to match them in their ambition and pragmatism.  I am also increasing the allocation for the commercial horticulture scheme to &euro;6 million, recognising the need for greater efficiencies and innovation in that sector in the face of the challenges already endured and those ahead.  I welcome the fact that the level of applications to this year&rsquo;s scheme exceeds previous years.<br\/><br\/>Turning to forestry, the level of new afforestation we achieved last year was substantially lower than target but I am hopeful that at least some of the reduced rate was weather related and that activity will pick up this year.  A strong programme is crucial to our sector's contribution to climate change mitigation.  By the same token, I am fully aware of the concerns regarding afforestation in certain communities and my colleague, the Minster of State, Deputy Doyle, has recently established a group to examine this matter and to report this year.<br\/><br\/>Many of the programme C allocations reflect the comprehensive approach to Brexit responsiveness and how that intertwines with the continuing implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  It includes additional funding for capital investment by food companies, initiatives for artisan producers and further support for the prepared consumer foods centre at Ashtown.  I have also made a substantial contribution to Teagasc's national food innovation hub at Moorepark, which is reflected in the &euro;4 million increase in the capital allocation.  These initiatives, fostering innovation and product development, have been given a greater focus by Brexit but are consistent with the direction of travel of Food Wise 2025.  The implementation to date of Food Wise 2025 has positioned the sector to defend its market presence in the UK robustly and develop new markets.  In that regard, the allocation for Bord Bia has been increased by almost &euro;5 million and now stands at almost &euro;47 million compared with &euro;32 million pre-Brexit decision in 2015.<br\/><br\/>The extraordinary export success of our indigenous food sectors did not come easily or quickly.  Maintaining and growing this foothold in higher value markets requires huge efforts in the face of stiff competition and challenges such as Brexit.  In 2018, after years of work, we achieved a very substantial breakthrough in opening the Chinese market for bone-in beef and further deep work is needed to exploit that hard-won opportunity fully.  In that regard, I will also be expanding my Department&rsquo;s global footprint.  My Department has eight agricultural attach&eacute; posts in embassies in the European Union and across the world, including in Beijing and Washington DC.  I intend to expand this network by 50%, adding extra posts in the key locations of Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico.  Trade missions play an important role in market development.  In 2018, I led missions to US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.  This year I have already visited Turkey in early March and I plan to lead Government agrifood trade missions to China in May, Japan and South Korea in June, and Algeria and Egypt in November.<br\/><br\/>I have also increased the allocation for the horse and greyhound fund by &euro;4 million, a 5% increase to help with the work in promoting and supporting these sectors.  I am pleased that the greyhound Bill has made good progress in the Seanad and I hope it will pass into legislation later this year.  I hope that with its financial position greatly improved after the sale of Harold's Cross stadium, the sector will move forward with confidence.  Horse Racing Ireland is investing heavily in new facilities and services and we continue to be a very important partner to the industry.<br\/><br\/>The zero allocation for Brexit resilience as presented in the Revised Estimates Volume 2019 in contrast to the &euro;25 million in 2018 might give cause for concern.  However, as I have set out, we have a very intense focus on Brexit, with an overall package of &euro;78 million in funding distributed across a number of subheads, including the &euro;7 million for staff and information technology to facilitate my Department's regulatory role.  Moreover, the 2018 allocation for the future growth loan, which involved a contribution via the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to the European Investment Bank, EIB, has just been launched, so the benefits of the investment in the loan funding will start to flow to both primary producers and processors in 2019.<br\/><br\/>Part of our Supplementary Estimate for 2018 involved the transfer of savings from various subheads into the World Food Programme, WFP, to allow for the earliest possible payment of our 2019 contribution to that programme.  Accordingly, when taken together with that voted amount and a further allocation of &euro;4 million from later identified savings, the total WFP contribution in 2019 will amount to &euro;22 million.  This is an increase of 10% on our contribution for 2018.<br\/><br\/>With respect to programme D, the provision for my Department&rsquo;s seafood programme has been increased by &euro;6 million, mostly by way of an increased allocation to the fishery harbour centres to a total of &euro;27 million, and this will help fund vital investment in Castletownbere and Killybegs harbours.  The budget provision will also allow the Marine Institute to commence the planned replacement of the 21 year old <i>Celtic Voyager<\/i>with a new 50 m modern research vesselThe other significant change in programme D is the reduced allocation for the Haulbowline remediation project.  This reflects the great progress made in 2018, resulting in the completion of the east tip remediation.<br\/><br\/>The majority of funding for Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is in respect of various schemes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, operational programme.  This is fully operational, with a total of 19 schemes.  The investment will fund a range of programmes, including capital investment in the seafood processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors to foster growth in production, value and employment, enhance sustainability and competitiveness, and support training, skills development and stakeholder capacity development.  We continue to support the sector in what we all know to be a very challenging period.<br\/><br\/>I have not referred to another very important aspect of the work of the year ahead, namely, the negotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post 2020.  Although it is not visible in the Vote, there is much work under way in my Department in preparing for the next CAP and we can discuss this further during the course of the meeting.<br\/><br\/>These funding allocations will assist us in focusing on competitiveness, innovation, new market development and environmental sustainability while responding to the uncertainty and challenge posed by Brexit.  This is a brief overview of the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for 2019.  I look forward to the discussion and questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#B00300","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming in today to discuss the Revised Estimates.  Will the Minister outline the key differences between the Revised Estimates and the Estimates provided after the budget?  This meeting is happening against the backdrop of Brexit and, over recent months, a crisis facing the beef sector.  Permission was granted from the EU to increase permissible state aid from &euro;15,000 to &euro;25,000 five or six weeks ago, but our beef sector in particular has been in crisis for a number of months.  Many finishers have been losing their shirts.  There must be immediate support for those farmers, especially those involved with finishing cattle who have lost significant money.  It is affecting the sector as a whole, and unless there is some support from the Government and this Department in particular, the beef sector will be further undermined.  The Minister has mentioned a number of times how welcome is the increase in permissible state aid.  That is of no use unless we assist farmers.  Has the Minister considered this and can we expect to see something immediately from the Department to provide support to the beef sector?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister speak to the BEEP uptake?  In his contribution he did not outline how many farmers availed of it, how far that number is off target and where we are with the associated budget.<\/p><p>I would also like the Minister to flesh out how the &euro;1 million in associated estimates in regard to weighing and will be spent and to comment on whether it will be sufficient to ensure there is not a burden on farmers who are participating in regard to the cost of weighing.  <\/p><p> In regard to the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, and projected spend in that regard, I note the current round is due to expire at the end of April and that uptake in regard to projects was very slow initially.  In terms of the Department's future projections in regard to this scheme, is sufficient funding in place to meet likely demand in the future?  In regard to the 2018 outgoings, was there an underspend in the Department's overall allocation and, if so, what happened to that underspend?  <\/p><p> In respect of Brexit and preparations in this regard, the Department outlined plans last September to hire 116 veterinary inspectors.  Earlier in the summer, it had announced that 300 veterinary inspectors would be hired.  What progress has been made in regard to the hiring of those inspectors?  I note that a few weeks ago, the Department advertised in the public press for private veterinary practitioners to indicate their interest to be available to work in the ports and points of entry in the event of a hard Brexit.  I took from that that there has been no progress made in regard to the hiring of veterinary inspectors.  I ask the Minister to provide further detail in this regard.  <\/p><p> In regard to the Brexit loan scheme, which was finally announced last week but was initially announced under budget 2018 in October 2017, will the Minister outline what happened to the funding that was allocated in budget 2018 for this scheme?  Was it used elsewhere or carried forward?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#C00200","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a number of points but the critical one, which I think many in the agriculture community would acknowledge, is the challenge facing the beef sector, on which we had a construction debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber last week.  We are directing the resources available to the State in a targeted way to farmers to try to shore up falling incomes.  As the Deputy will be aware, unfortunately or otherwise, the reality is that there is nothing I can do in respect of meat factories and the prices they pay.  What I can do is ensure that whatever resources I have are focused in the most effective way to the sector.  The keys areas of action are increasing payments under areas of natural constraint, ANC, introducing schemes such as the beef environmental programme and driving the adoption and implementation of producer organisations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked where we are at with regard to the beef environmental efficiency pilot.  There were 18,536 applicants, covering almost 450,000 weanlings.  There is a significant level of interest in this scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware, the intention in respect of the scheme is for individual farmers who have applied for the scheme to have their own scales registered, in respect of which there is a facility to do this online on the Department's website, or for them to be able to avail of a bank of weighing scales that will be delivered for the purposes of the scheme through a series of outlets around the country.  Farmers will be able to borrow these scales to weigh their cattle and then return them.  This is how the programme will operate.  The intention is to deliver the scheme as efficiently as possible with the least amount of bureaucracy or administrative burden and to target whatever scarce resources are available into the pockets of participating farmers.  To the best of my recollection, the cost of providing the scales is approximately &euro; 1 million.  The remainder of the money will go directly to farmers who are applicants.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Brexit staffing, I know that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#D00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>In regard to the funding allocation, what was the uptake in comparison with the target?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#D00300","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My understanding is 450,000 weanlings are covered.

The ambition is to pay this scheme in the current calendar year.<\/p> <p>  On Brexit staffing, on which the Deputy has been asking a lot of questions, we are trying to manage a situation as prudently and effectively as possible.  We made estimates and were involved in a central case scenario early on and in more recent times in terms of the necessary staffing requirement to deal with a crash-out Brexit.  In a crash-out situation, there will be an escalating requirement for staff over a period of time.  I am certain that should that happen next week or in May, we will be able to fulfil our obligations in respect of checking on trade coming from a third country and facilitating trade that we export to what then will be a third country.<\/p> <p>  As I understand it, the current staffing complement is in the region of 120, comprised of a mixture of veterinary inspectors, forest inspectors, technical staff, clerical officer portal inspectors, agricultural inspectors and a range of administrative staff.

I am concerned that there has been little or no action in regard to follow-through in regard to recruitment of this 116 staff or the previously-announced 300 staff.  Will the Minister outline what was intended in terms of that 116 staff and what has happened in this regard.  The first we heard about private veterinary practices being asked to front up in regard to providing assistance was when the advertisements were published in the papers a few weeks ago.

For example, the Wexford facility will operate on the basis of two rosters and Dublin Port will operate around the clock, if I am not mistaken.  We have been able to drill down into the granular detail around the staffing requirement.  The overwhelming imperative is that whatever the Brexit date we are in a position to meet our legal requirements and satisfy the European Union in that regard.  Rather than recruit a lot or direct staff, with all of the contingent responsibilities and liabilities that that would bring with it, I have been trying to meet this requirement from the point of view of the most financially efficient way to do it.<\/p><p>In doing it efficiently financially, we must also make sure we are doing everything necessary with regard to our legal obligations.  We have worked through the detail of that around all of the border inspection posts and the type of staff that are necessary.  We have refined our numbers requirement and I expect it will increase to some 230 staff.  That is the figure we see as ultimately necessary but there will be some 120 staff <i>in situ <\/i>on 12 April.  This involves redeployment of existing staff and new recruits.  We have been working with the Revenue Commissioners in availing of some of the panels it has had, from which we have recruited some staff.

It is the case, however, that a crash-out and a requirement for these staff is more likely now than it was some time ago when we were planning for the central case scenario.  I am satisfied that we will be able to do everything that is necessary on the dates in question.<br\/><br\/>I will give the Deputy some data.  Dublin Port, for example, will be staffed on a 24-7 basis.  At peak times in Dublin Airport the Department will have some 40 staff on the ground to do documentary and physical identity checks when dealing with the UK once it becomes a third country.  As I said earlier, Rosslare Port will operate on two shifts per day based on ferry activity with ten to 15 departmental staff managing inspections for these operations across peak times.  The outcome is based on what is necessary to meet the demand.  I am satisfied that come 12 April, or any future date, we will have the necessary number of staff in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#D00600","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Is that primarily from reassignment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#E00200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Some are reassigned and some are new staff.

There has been no follow-through on that.  Now the Minister is doing it in different ways.

I am aware of the headline the Deputy refers to, but I ask that he bears in mind it was in the context of a central case scenario which was a withdrawal agreement, a transitional arrangement and Brexit happening in an orderly way by the end of 2020.  This scenario would have required rolling recruitment of staff up to that period in time.  The Deputy is trying to make the case that because the envisaged number of staff for the 2020 deadline has not been reached by today - when there is a possibility of a crash-out - that in some way we are not prepared.  I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that Ireland is the most Brexit-prepared member state.  There are enough challenges and uncertainty out there without fomenting uncertainty in this interaction.  We will be ready in the most financially efficient way.  Obviously there will be other people who have responsibilities around recruitment, across the HSE for example, with inspectors and so on in other areas of supervision and regulation to do with food businesses.  They will not be recruited in this particular context but it will all be done to make sure we keep business moving and exports getting to marketplaces.  The figures the Deputy spoke about were to the date at the end of 2020.  The figures I have given to the Deputy are for what we are now planning: staff to be on the ground to deal with the necessary situation, should the UK crash out in the short term.  This will increase and ratchet up.

I have said before that it is a long running story, certainly longer than we anticipated, and it required primary legislation because of the involvement of the European Investment Bank.  It was much more complicated than our previous foray in this area with the working capital scheme or the other &euro;300 million working programme for small business.  The fund is there now and it is welcome because it plugs a gap in the market that was not previously serviced with regard to the unsecured borrowing of money over seven years.  It is very important that it is there.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's other question was on TAMS.  The allocation for TAMS this year is &euro;70 million.

I have a few bits and pieces about which to ask, but everything will be set against the background of Brexit.  I sometimes despair listening to people wanting us to not second-guess, but fourth-guess, what will happen across the water when the people there do not have a clue what is happening.  It is a nonsense.  This is an Irish tendency, where one has to be the leprechaun to jump into the middle of the sea and try to guess what will happen.  Let us see and let us keep nice and cool, and calm.  I get irked when I hear that type of nonsense.<\/p> <p>  I am worried about basic issues.  In areas of natural constraint, ANC, the Minister has provided &euro;250 million in 2019, a &euro;23 million increase.  The biophysical parameters are now involved.  Of course, it has gone to an appeals process.  All appeals must be in by 8 April.  With this two-stage process, is there any indication of the likely number of appeals?  There is only a week left.<\/p> <p>  The Minister would expect me to mention beef, given where I come from.  I will mention a few factors here because I have an interest in this issue.  A big issue is the grading issue on the kill lines in factories.  I happen to be out meeting farmers.  It is great to get out to get a bit of fresh air and talk to the Westmeath farmers, many of whom are involved with the beef farmers' forum and beef group.  They are fairly hot on the ground and they are not fools.  They know there can be no magic wand.  They are intelligent people.  Yesterday, I spoke to a man with 250 cattle and 150 sheep who well knows that.  This mechanical grading is just not doing the business.  This man said that they are able to put a digital machine in the air which will tell where one turned the course of a river.  He asked why we could not do so in a factory and make sure that farmers get paid.  I understand the grades were wrong on a number of occasions.  Were there a number of cases where they were wrong in four out of every ten animals?  Maybe I am wrong but that is what I hear on the ground.  There is grave concern about this and it has to be tackled.  It is no use having a beef forum and being nice to those factory boys coming in.  One has to give them a few punches when they are in.  The legal tolerance - maybe I am wrong and the Minister has senior officials who know all this - for beef grading machines in meat plants is approximately 60%.  We should get that up to even 85% or 90% - I accept we will not have 100% - as that is a lot of money going out the door.  There are significant losses in that.  I understand trials are taking place with digital cameras, LED lights, etc., but how far advanced are they?  Is there a plan to deal with those perceived issues?  Maybe they are only perceived.  I hear anecdotally about grading anomalies in the factories and between factories and it is a cause of concern.  Things are bad enough on the ground, as I will illustrate, but if we could intervene, we could make a positive contribution in trying to deal with those issues.  We brought in grids, for example, and if they are not working, they must be re-examined.  We cannot stick to the same old line that they are grand in respect of this and the quality price system, QPS.  We must sort those out.  That is from where I am starting.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to another farmer yesterday.  He said it appeared that everybody was getting a cut out of it.  All the intermediaries, between farm and fork, are getting a cut and the only ones who are not getting a cut are the producers.  The processors are getting plenty of cuts - the Minister need not worry about that.  They are cutting people any chance they get.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Martin O'Sullivan was a colleague of mine in the 1980s, which is a long time ago.  He did a study, which is well worth reading, taking the Teagasc farm management survey on suckling and cattle rearing on an average-sized farm of 87 acres.  Between 2013 and 2017, the return on that farm, including subsidies, was &euro;11,063, or &euro;130 an acre.  Let us not forget the subsidies are included.  Between 1998 to 2002, the average income was &euro;12,228, some &euro;1,200 more.  In the meantime, there was inflation of 37%.  In order to stand still, one would need &euro;16,752.  That tells members, who themselves are involved in a bit of this and are interested, one would need &euro;6,700 more to stand still on the same farm, the same number of animals, etc.  Of course, the subsidies are 105% profit.  Without the subsidies, it would be a negative wash-out.<\/p> <p>  One should bear in mind that Westmeath is a fulcrum of suckler farms.  These are farmers who do the proper beef.  They are not into the dairy stuff.  Theirs is the real stuff.  I spoke to those farmers yesterday and one man said to me that he would be better off if he let the land or put much of it into forestry.  He said a man up the road was going into dairy an that he could let it to him.  I cannot issue enough warnings about this rush into dairying, particularly by those in the beef dry stock area.  It might sound great but, Lord save us, it involves a level of investment, work and everything else.  Apart from that altogether, I never saw a balloon going up that did not come down.  That is what worries me.  That is the story.  The return is &euro;130 per acre and all that is all subsides.<\/p> <p>  The policy over the years must have been devised by Gay Byrne as there is a little for everyone in the audience.  That is a problem.  We must make our minds up on a policy direction and see where we are to go.  The next round of CAP measures will be the defining time.  It will be time for the Minister to make his mind up because he cannot represent everybody.  If the Minister wants to have a policy objective to make sure we sustain the maximum number of farmers, something will have to happen.<\/p> <p>  The reason I raise that is there was a vote in the European Parliament today about convergence.  If I am correct, it opted for 75% convergence, which is Big Phil's story, as opposed to 100% convergence, which is the left-wing story.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#F00200","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>It left it at 100%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#F00300","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Did it give the 100%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#F00400","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#F00500","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I heard it was 75%.

We have pious aspirations about 2030 but I will have the Shannon drained before that and TB will still not be eradicated.  I do not know where we are going to go with this.  Some &euro;5.5 billion has gone since it started and another &euro;1 billion is planned.  We will have to look at new ways of dealing with this as it is taxpayers' money.  New Zealand has achieved the objective and they set out to do something about it in Australia too.  Professor Simon More gave us a very detailed talk about it but he also delivered some home truths.  I understand a TB group is looking at an evaluation of the situation and the various methods that could be used.  I do not have a solution but going down the same way of dealing with it between now and 2030, or even 2050, will not work.  Somebody will have to change something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#G00300","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will deal with the last point first.  I could not agree more with the Deputy that if we want to achieve the objective by 2030, doing exactly what we are doing now will not deliver.  It is an ambitious target but it is probably more doable than draining the Shannon.  We have spent &euro;5.5 billion in today's money and the plan is to spend another &euro;1 billion between now and 2030, by which time we hope to have eliminated TB.  It is not that there will be no incidence of TB but we will be below a certain threshold and thus deemed to be TB-free for the purpose of international trade, which will bring its own benefits.<\/p><p>I have established a working group under the chairmanship of Michael Cronin and the issues it is considering are raising the pulse rate a little bit.  I have deliberately refrained from commenting on any of those issues because it is respectful to the group to allow it to bring forward its proposals.  Representatives of the farming industry are also involved in it.  The challenge is to step outside our comfort zone and embrace new positions on the basis that they are epidemiologically sound and based on science.<\/p><p>The Deputy will see that allocations this year are up, which does not reflect an increased incidence, though there is a marginal increase, so much as the fact that when a herd contracts tuberculosis now it is more costly because herds tend to be bigger.  The choice is to continue plodding along at the rate we are going or to do something more radical and try to achieve our ambition by 2030.  In that sense, we have to stop thinking all the time about the 3% which get TB and instead ensure the 97% do not get it, while looking after the 3%.  Studies are being done about the impact on deer and we have a badger vaccination programme.  We are spending an awful lot of taxpayers' money but, to make the quantum leap we need to make, we need to do different things.  This committee has had interesting engagement with veterinary personnel and academia, which has been thought-provoking and challenging, but we have to be prepared to listen to different voices too, including those who might suggest doing things somewhat differently.  We also need to look at international best practice and how other places have dealt with the issue.<\/p><p>The Deputy also asked about TAMS and the possibility of new measures.  Deputy Cahill has previously referred to underpasses and they are always looked for but the scope for manoeuvre is extremely limited.  Some of the early approvals under TAMS were expiring, having originally been three-year approvals.  We changed the scheme to 12-month approvals, with six-month approvals for plant.  The fact that the early ones were expiring gave us some wriggle room, which we used to announce that we would extend the availability of TAMS funding for solar panels in the livestock sector, which was previously confined to the intensive pig and poultry sector.  This is significant and there is significant potential in it but the scope to reopen the scheme is limited as the budget is finite.  It is not that extra money was made available but that some money was not being used, meaning we could include something else in the scheme.<\/p><p>The debate on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is picking up speed and there were votes in the European Parliament yesterday and today, though I am not <i>au fait<\/i>with the latest results.  A trend is emerging towards greater convergence.  There are disparities between people who get very large payments and others who get minimal payments and are forced out of farming or into part-time farming.  There is now a momentum to address this.  I support doing so but we need to be careful of the law of unintended consequences.  Last time, people had low gross single payments but they may have received a high payment per hectare.  Others had large tracts of land but got a lower payment per hectare than the average.  One person may have got &euro;300,000 and saw the amount go up while another, with a payment of &euro;10,000, saw it go down.  We need to avoid that situation.<\/p><p>There is an inevitability around convergence.  Apart from happening internally it is, unfortunately from our point of view, happening externally, with other member states saying they want a greater share of the Common Agricultural Policy budget.  This is challenging for us and that brings me to the overall point, which is that the most important challenge we face is in securing an adequate budget.  We need to encourage young farmers and we do so with top-ups, TAMS, the national reserve, the tax system, stock relief and a new &euro;25,000 credit for succession partnerships, but the best thing we can do for them is to encourage them to see a return for their commitment to the sector.  The age profile in Irish agriculture shows that the youngest are in dairy while the oldest are on the beef side and that tells it all.  Young people do not see the beef industry delivering for them in the long term and that is part of the challenge.<\/p><p>Part of that involves greater equity in the payments and convergence is part of that process.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the ANC scheme.  More than 1,500 farmers covering 760 townlands have lodged appeals and the closing date is in one week.  There is a very capable appeals panel in place to deal with appeals.  This was a challenging exercise.  It is critical that people tick the box for the ANC scheme when filling out the basic payment application form.  Even if they are excluded under the current revised arrangements, they may succeed following an appeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#G00400","speaker":"1285","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Is there a timescale for the completion of the ANC appeals process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#H00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>The deadline for submission of an application is 8 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#H00300","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":53,"content":"<p>What is the timeframe after that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#H00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>We hope to deal with the appeals as expeditiously as possible.

Last week, a Private Members' Bill was introduced in response to the crisis in the beef industry.  A large amount of beef is exported to the EU market.  There is very little recognition of how dependent the Dutch and Danes are on the UK market.  In the case of a no-deal Brexit both countries will seek a home for their products, which will have severe implications on the beef and pig sectors here.  There has not been much discussion on that matter.<\/p> <p>  The small number of farmers left in the pig sector have gone through an horrendous 18 months or two years.  It looks like the outbreak of swine flu in China will come to their rescue and, hopefully, result in increased pig prices.  The swine flu has been reported in China for about six months and it seems to be having an impact on pig production in China.  The pig industry will disappear shortly if something does not change.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the presentation made by the Minister but I am disappointed it did not focus more on live exports.  Only a small number of cattle over 12 months are being exported live at the moment.  Deputy Penrose spoke about farmers' dissatisfaction with the grid.  The only way to get competition among processors is through live exports.  When we kill almost 40,000 cattle per week processors do what they like with the primary producer.  That is what has happened for the past six months.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is the number of cattle the factories are producing.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, must examine this issue.  For two months, nearly 20% of the kill has been factory-owned cattle.  Factories can manipulate the marketplace and control the price they pay to farmers.  In the past five years, we have not seen beef prices increase due to scarcity because the factories are now able to control the market and put their own cattle into the system.  In the past, cattle prices always rose as the end of the beef fattening season in the sheds approached but that no longer happens.  The CCPC is well able to tell farmers what they can do but it is slow to get involved in the monopoly operated by the meat factories.  That must change and it would give farmers some confidence to see some movement on the issue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the grid, the way in which the flat classification works has changed in recent years.  Cattle that were classified as grade 4 in the past are now definitely being classified as grade 3, while grade 3 cattle are being classified as grade 2.  These changes in classifications should not happen if we want farmers to have confidence in mechanical grading.<\/p> <p>  On veterinary inspections, the Minister stated the meat inspection service will receive a substantial increase in funding.  What was agreed following the strike in the sector and how much will the agreement cost?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose spoke about the 2030 target for eradicating tuberculosis.  Last Thursday or Friday, a farmer told me that his whole herd of between 180 and 190 dairy cows was to be depopulated.  The first question he was asked was whether deer had been on his land.  He replied that deer were constantly coming out of the plantations on to his land.  A fortnight ago, he had a TB test done on his farm and his dairy herd was declared to have TB.  Herd depopulation has occurred a number of times in County Tipperary recently and the common denominator has been deer encroaching on the land.  Until we focus on the role deer play in the spread of tuberculosis, we will not get on top of the issue.  There are people in Wicklow who have chosen not to keep cattle or bovine animals because they could never clear their farms of TB.  Another bunch of farmers in the Killoscully area of Tipperary has heavy plantations and, unfortunately, their herds are all constantly locked up with TB.  It is the same story in Rossmore.  The vast majority of TB outbreaks in County Tipperary occur in areas frequented by deer.  We must recognise that fact.  A cull of deer or tests on the deer population would be very expensive but until we address the issue, we will not make progress in reducing the incidence of bovine TB.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to the working group on tuberculosis and the 3% of herds that will be affected by new restrictions introduced for cattle movement and the possibility of indicating on signs at marts how long it has been since a farmer last had a breakdown done on TB.  Farmers will feel very disgruntled if no restrictions are applied to the movement of the deer that are causing TB outbreaks on their farms when the Department then undervalues the stock that leaves their farms.  Discussions are needed before we bring in such restrictions on movement.<\/p> <p>  How many farmers are participating in the hen harrier scheme?  How many of the farmers who applied to the scheme have not been admitted to it?  It is grand to have a scheme up and running for the hen harrier.  However, as I said when the scheme commenced, the barometer of its success would be if it restored the capital value of the land.  The scheme has given some income to the farmers who have had their lands designated for the hen harrier but it has gone nowhere in respect of restoring the capital value of the land in question.  Some land for planting was worth between &euro;4,000 or &euro;4,500 per acre but is now worth between &euro;800 and &euro;900 per acre because it has been designated under the hen harrier scheme.  Until farmers are compensated to the extent that the capital value of their land is restored, the scheme cannot be deemed a success.  How many farmers have availed of the scheme and how many applications have been refused?  How many farmers have applied but were not accepted for the scheme?<\/p> <p>  The appeals process for the disadvantaged areas scheme was mentioned.  I presume the Estimates make provision for successful appeals.  When does the Minister expect the appeals process to finish?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about young farmers and the different incentives available to attract young people to the farming profession.  A scheme for young farmers is essential.  We all know the figures on the age of farmers, which make frightening reading.  A cap has been placed on the amount of incentives a young farmer can get.  Given the increase in stamp duty to 6%, this cap will have a serious detrimental effect on the transfer of land.  It restricts a farmer's access to stock relief.  The Minister is shaking his head in response.  I have tabled questions to the Minister for Finance and unless his answers are incorrect, the cap will have a serious detrimental effect on the incentives that can be availed of by young farmers.  At first glance, &euro;70,000 sounds like a big figure.  However, if stamp duty of 6% applies on a farm of 150 acres, a young farmer will well exceed the ceiling.  The cap will not allow stock relief or any of the tax incentives the Minister mentioned.<\/p><p>This barrier has to be re-examined.  If I am wrong the Minister for Finance is wrong in his replies to me also, but we can discuss that.<\/p><p> The Minister mentioned TAMS, which I had brought up previously, and getting underpasses eligible for TAMS.  There would be very significant demand out there for such a measure.  Traffic flows on rural roads are increasing and herd sizes are also increasing.  It would be good, if it was at all possible, to have underpasses incentivised.  I could go over other items in the Vote but those are just the points I wanted to make.  I await with anticipation the Minister's response to me on the &euro;70,000 limit to incentives for young farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#H00700","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with those.  A lot of questions were asked there.  On deer and TB, it is my clear understanding that where farmers or communities raise the prospect of deer possibly being a contributing factor to a TB incident, the Department's local veterinary office is quite prepared to have deer samples taken in the local laboratories.  It is not as though the Department is turning a blind eye to the deer issue at all.  In fact, in most of the cases the deer are found not to be the causing factor.  We do, however, have to be open to the possibility of deer being a contributing factor.<\/p> <p>  The culling of deer is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, but it is open to farmers whose lands are overrun by deer to apply to the National Parks and Wildlife Service under section 42 of the Wildlife Act for a licence to kill deer.  This is different to a cull in a national park.  It would be a local cull on the basis of incursions on a regular basis.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service deal with this and licences to kill deer are issued.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of hen harriers - I can get more detail - but all applicants will be included in the scheme by April or May this year.

That has been resolved and the allocation is up from &euro;18.2 million to &euro;21 million, an increase of &euro;2.75 million in the 2019 allocation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill spoke about the cattle grading grid.  Different people want the grid to be revisited for different reasons.  I know the background that Deputy Cahill has come from in making this point.  While some farming organisations have a particular view of the world, other farming organisations have an entirely different view of the world but want the same thing to achieve different outcomes.  I have made the point that the grid is not a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grid.  The grid was facilitated by the Department through the loaning of expertise.  The grid and the payment from the grid is an arrangement between farm organisations and the meat industry.  If our expertise is requested again we would be quite willing but there is no agreed position on this matter between farm organisations as I understand it.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also spoke about live exports and I am glad that he did.  We have different views of the world.  I take the view that live exports are important.  The surest way to guarantee that live exports continue is by absolute vigilance on the welfare issues around live exports.  We are adamant and insistent on that.  In 2018, Ireland exported 246,000 head of cattle, of which approximately 160,000 were calves.  To facilitate the calf exports we reduced the levy from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 per calf exported.  In so doing we also brought in the calf exporters and said that they were the beneficiaries to the tune of almost &euro;750,000 just on the levy alone.  I engaged directly with them last July - if my recollection is correct - and there has been ongoing engagement with them by the Department since then and before that.  I have also engaged directly with them every year since I was appointed.  In the middle of year I met them because we knew the issue of additional calves in the system was coming down the track in the spring of 2019.  We asked the exporters to work together and with their contracting lairage providers in France to make sure the issue could be dealt with.  I regret to say this did not happen.  We are, however, committed to live exports.  I was in Turkey recently on a short mission in respect of live exports.  That is an important market and I will also be going to some north African markets later in the year.  We see them as hugely important, and not just for the calves.  Obviously calves hedge off a problem later but there is also the export of weanlings.  We certainly remain committed to that.<\/p> <p>  On the pork issue, it has been a horrendous 12 to 18 months for those in the pig sector.  On the basis of every cloud having a silver lining, farmers may be pinning their hopes on the incidence of African swine fever, which may mean a rise in prices internationally.  Deputy Cahill referred to the market in China and I am aware of the difficulties happening there with African swine fever.  I hope this happens but I am not in the business of predicting what will happen with prices.  I hope that what the Deputy referred to may happen.<\/p> <p>  As for beef in the context of Brexit, the Dutch and the Danes in particular, the Deputy's point is true and undoubtedly the case.  In volume of exports to the UK market the Dutch would be really up there.  I believe that 11% of the Netherlands' total agrifood export offering goes to the UK, while it is 40% of ours.  In value terms, however, it is about the same.  Ireland certainly will not be the only ones looking for support but given the volume of product we put into the UK market, one of our arguments to the Commission has been that we need to contain the issue in the UK market or the contagion would spread into all other European Union markets.  We would look for supports for our industry to keep their products in the UK market until such a time as we negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement, which we will.  Hopefully this will be by the short route rather than the long, circuitous route of a crash-out and the carnage that goes with it.<\/p><p>Certainly in the event of a crash-out and a package being offered, we will not be the only ones looking for support and nor will beef be the only sector looking for support.

Trees are a critical part of the solution.  I am not saying they should be concentrated in any given area.  Apart from the climate obligation, they also bring a number of other benefits in terms of employment and income that is tax-free for 15 years.  There is also employment in timber processing and downstream businesses.  We could collectively do well to consider how we could work to promote forestry.

I am concerned about another issue.  There is an increase in the amount of money for Bord Bia.  It has increased to &euro;47 million this year, which is a substantial amount for the promotion of Irish food abroad and so forth.  As the Minister mentioned, much of the work involves going to what are, in effect, third countries, such as the US, Canada, China and so forth, and developing new markets.  That is very welcome.  However, many people would consider that many of those new markets, particularly those that are further away, are for our prime or higher quality cuts of beef.  We all know that a large amount of the beef product produced in this country is the lower quality which ends up in manufacturing beef, and there is a large market for that in Britain.  With Brexit approaching and the pressure that will come in respect of that product, is there an opportunity to emphasise marketing it in other European countries as a possible destination for it?  What are the Minister's views on that?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Penrose said earlier that the idea of the European Union was to have cheap food.  We need to get away from the cheap aspect, if we can, and talk about quality and affordable food.  The idea of cheap food is our problem.  Irish farmers are not in a position to produce cheap food.  We are in a position to produce very high quality, affordable food to a standard that is well above what many other places can produce.  We must market it in that way.<\/p> <p>  The Minister indicated that additional veterinary certificates and so forth had to be issued when product is being exported to third countries.  What if we run into a difficulty with Brexit?  While the intention is that we keep the market in Britain with whatever supports we can and that we will continue to supply our food there, will that impose an extra burden?  We will have to produce these certificates because the UK will, in effect, be a third country if there is a crash-out, which is looking more likely every day.  Having to issue all those additional veterinary certificates for export to Britain would impose a huge burden.  They are not necessary at present.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is not mentioned here, but a review of the veterinary laboratories was carried out over the past year.  What is the position with that?  I recently spoke to in Sligo who are very concerned about the veterinary laboratory there.  A number of laboratories are under review.  What is their status and what is the position with the review?  It is not in the Estimates but I would appreciate it if the Minister could give a view on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to CAP, I understand that 2% of the overall budget at European level is being set aside for young farmers.  There will be more autonomy coming back to the member state regarding how it deals with these matters.  Is there an opportunity to increase that perhaps to 3% of the budget?  We need to do that to facilitate more younger people getting into farming.<\/p> <p>  A large section of Pillar 1 of CAP, I understand it is up to 20%, will be for eco-measures.  One of those eco-measures is something that arises regularly.  Most of the farmers who contact us do so because of a problem with payments.  The main problem is that their basic payments are refused due to penalties being put in place.  The width of hedgerows was meant to be 2 m and when the photographs were taken from the sky, they were 4 m wide because they had grown out.  That was not a problem for the farmer.  In fact, it was good for the farmer, for the environment, for greenhouse gas sequestration and so forth, yet the farmers are penalised for it.  The hedgerow area should be included in the area that would be allowed for Pillar 1 payments under basic payments.  It should have been done at all times.<\/p> <p>  The other issue relates to TAMS payments.  A considerable number of people who made applications for TAMS payments have been waiting a long time for their applications to be processed.  One farmer told me he had made an application and it was accepted last October.  He was told it would probably be May or June before he would be approved.  If farmers have to wait that long to get the building work and everything else they want to get done for the season completed, it will not work for them.  Can the Minister give his view on the length of time it takes to process applications, particularly those relating to farm buildings?<\/p><p>I acknowledge that afforestation and biomass were mentioned.  I do not wish to have an argument about it, but one of the main aspects is the tax-free nature of forestry development, which the Minister mentioned.  If every cent farmers made from, say, organic farming was tax free, there would be a lot more people working in organic farming; there would be labour involved, and it would keep communities alive.  However, if forestry development was tax free, 100% all the way through the process, it would cause a problem.  I do not mean that there should not be tax incentives, but the level of tax incentives is excessive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#L02600","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":112,"content":"<p>On Bord Bia, &euro;47 million is a substantial increase in Exchequer funding, although I do not think the Deputy was making any contrary point, given that he was asking whether we had received the best value for the markets Bord Bia was targeting.  That is always a challenge and I am not a marketing expert, but the team, the board and the executive are very good.  I have a lot of confidence in them and they do a good job.<\/p> <p>  China, South-East Asia and the wider Asian region have been targeted in Food Wise 2025; it is not a matter of the Department determining where food should be exported.  Generally, it is due to the emerging middle classes looking westwards with their dietary habits and so on, which means that there are opportunities.  As I understand it, the problem with the European market for beef, for example, to which the Deputy referred, is that while there is a market for premium cuts, it is not a growing but a static market.  The growing markets for beef are in Asia.  As an overall percentage, they are small but growing.  We recently read in the newspapers that one of our major processors had secured a new contract to supply more beef.  The Asian market is interested in all cuts, not just premium cuts.  One of the contracts awarded was for part of the fifth quarter.  I visited a restaurant chain, the name of which I cannot remember, on the previous occasion I travelled to China.  In both Japan and China they seek premium cuts and those from the fifth quarter.  There is a market for these products.<\/p> <p>  In many of these matters the function of the Department is to open markets as generously as we can negotiate.  I may have misled the committee when I indicated that bone-in beef was sought in China because I meant boneless beef.  We are always seeking to improve the terms and conditions of access, but it takes time.  It is a matter of building relationships.  We have been fortunate to have good relationships with the Chinese and the Chinese ambassador in Dublin who is leaving but who has been a great asset to us in that regard.  We open markets, but the industry decides what it sells to the market.  However, I understand that in China the full range of products is being sold.  In the context of Brexit, we have always said the United Kingdom is the best paying market and people are slow to leave it, notwithstanding all of the challenges.  It is important that other doors are opened for exporters, which is how we view our function. <\/p> <p>  On veterinary certification, we already have to certify our products for third countries to which businesses export.  When the United Kingdom becomes a third country, although it has indicated that it will not request veterinary certification for our products, that may change over time as there may be regulatory divergence, where its standards may change and become different from those of the European Union.  Therefore, it may require certification.  We have factored this into our preparations in respect of the staff who will be required, not just in the Department but also in the HSE, local authorities, abattoirs and so on.  They will all have a role to play in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On young farmers and the CAP, it is a significant challenge, but we invested 2% of our budget in the young farmer aspect of the CAP on the previous occasion and it met the demand.  However, if there was to be growing demand or if it was considered greater incentives were needed, we could consider increasing it, given that these matters are up for debate.<\/p> <p>  One of the areas to which the Deputy referred was environmental measures and the climate becoming more mainstream, but that does not cause us to have sleepless nights.  We were on that trajectory before it was popular, with schemes we have piloted and driven such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, its predecessors and the beef data and genomics programme.  It is welcome that the CAP may give us more policy levers to meet our climate change obligations.<\/p> <p>  While I note the Deputy's point on forestry, the overwhelming majority of the beneficiaries of the tax incentive are farmers, which is as it should be.  I reiterate that we have a hierarchy of objectives to achieve, the most critical of which is planting trees for carbon sequestration.  We need all of the incentives we can have because our level of afforestation, notwithstanding the challenges in certain communities, is far too low.  There are income opportunities for farmers in that regard which far exceed anything they might make on marginal land, if not from anything else, certainly more than they would make from beef production at current prices.  We need to retain the incentives and have re-examined and increased them, which is right in the context of climate climate and carbon sequestration.<\/p> <p>  On TAMS approvals, the case the Deputy made does not resonate because we have no backlog of approvals.  The Deputy referred to an application made in October 2018 for which approval had not yet been received, but it sounds as though there might have been a documentation deficit on the applicant's part.  If the Deputy wishes to supply me with the details, I will have the case examined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#M00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>The Deputy also asked about the laboratories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2019040200002#M00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1554224400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, we commissioned a cost-benefit analysis, which we are studying.

If one removes the big ticket item, namely, subhead C10, under the heading, Brexit resilience measures, one will see that &euro;25 million was drawn down in 2018.  It was accounted for in budget 2017 under the heading of the Brexit loan scheme.  That product is coming to the market and not replicated.  It is, therefore, a significant hit to the subhead.  In the case of the restoration of Johnstown Castle, for example, the cut of 48% is simply due to the fact that the work has been completed and there is no need to replicate the funding in 2019.  Apart from that, it is quite satisfactory overall.  In the case of the horse and greyhound fund, capital spending has been reduced by 3%, but current spending has risen by 6%.  Overall, therefore, there has also been an increase in the horse and greyhound fund.

Before I say anything I thank the committee for the huge amount of work it has put into the Citizens' Assembly and the report it recently published on climate action.  I know it took a lot of work and I believe it is the most important issue facing our generation.  I express appreciation for the work and I hope I will be able to do justice to it in our action plan, which is under development.  This is the first time I have come to present Estimates and I thank the committee for its hearing.<\/p> <p>  The total Estimate is &euro;665 million, &euro;288 million of which is capital investment across all of the briefs.  It covers communications, climate action and the environment.  Specifically on communications, the huge challenge is to ensure people in Ireland can avail of the opportunities afforded by the enormous transformation that digital technology is having on our world.  As members see in the Estimate, there are a number of areas where we make provision.  One is on the capital side, where there is a tentative allocation of &euro;75 million for the proposed State-led intervention and the national broadband plan intervention area.  The committee is familiar with what has happened in this area since 2016.  The number of people with high-speed broadband has increased from approximately 50% to 74% but there remains a figure of almost 25% for whom the commercial market will not deliver high-speed broadband to the standard set out in the specification made at the start of the process.  I am at an advanced point in terms of due diligence being undertaken between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I hope, as has been indicated by the Taoiseach, that I will be in a position to bring a recommendation to the Government very soon.<\/p> <p>  The second area to which I draw the attention of the committee is the money allocated to trading online vouchers and to providing digital skills for citizens.  These are both important schemes in their own right, in that they help to ensure people have the opportunity to participate in the impact that digital technology can have on their business, in the case of the trading online voucher, or on their lives, in the case of citizens who have not had experience of using digital technology.<\/p> <p>  The other two points to which it may be worth drawing the attention of the committee is the work of the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre.  The other significant area is the National Cyber Security Centre which, as Deputies probably know, has been significantly expanded in the past two years and is taking on new roles in terms of responding to incidents.  It has found to be very effective in how it responds to incidents.  It is going further under EU directives to have a role on essential services, whereby those services will have to report on a quarterly basis on the adequacy of their preparation to deal with cybersecurity.  Consultation on a new cybersecurity strategy is under way, to be developed over the coming months.  This deals with the top lines in communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#B00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comments to the wider committee for the work done on climate change.  The Minister has had an opportunity since taking office to look at where the situation with the national broadband plan now rests.  When he looks back at how we got to the position we are in, does he have any concerns about the tendering process and the competitive dialogue process entered into, in particular the decision taken by the Department at the time?  I carefully suggest it was taken in good faith, based on the recommendations to go down the gap funding model.  It was KPMG or perhaps PwC that did a report at the time on the ownership model that would best give the State best value for money.<\/p><p>At the time the gap-funding model was chosen because two players in the State had very considerable assets deployed from a broadband perspective and because their existence in the process effectively ensured best value for money.  We know that over time both those companies pulled out.  It could be contended that the State should have stalled the horses at that stage, regrouped and taken stock of the situation to ensure we were not left with one pretty small operator as the only potential bidder in the race.<\/p><p> In a perhaps convoluted way, I come to my question.  Looking back, does the Minister have any concerns that the best path might not have been chosen?  Should greater care have been taken at an earlier stage to ensure the State got best value for money and was not left with just one bidder in the race?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#B00500","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>The gap-funding model was chosen for good reason.  The idea was that the State did not have a preconceived notion of how this ambition would best be served.  It wanted to test the market.  It also wanted to ensure that irrespective of the technology that was developed and put in place, there would be an incentive for whoever was operating it to keep it future-proofed throughout its life.<\/p> <p>  The backdrop to this is that a number of years ago Eir was sold off, meaning that we do not own the vast majority of the network.  The inevitable feature of this intervention area is that it has to graft itself upon an existing network that is in private sector ownership.  I do not pretend that I have read every document from that period when that decision was being taken.  However, it was taken on the right basis that the best way to develop this was to stimulate the private sector to come up with a solution that grafted onto existing assets that were not in public ownership.  That was the best option.  State ownership, in itself, did not confer benefits since it would be a piece of a much wider jigsaw.  That was the backdrop.  I have no reason to suggest it was not the right decision.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, when two of the bidders decided not to proceed, a decision was taken that nonetheless we would continue with the competitive dialogue.  That was taken on the basis that there was an understanding in the Department of the parameters of a successful bid to deliver the sort of solution that was emerging.  It was interesting that all the cost-effective solutions emerging were fibre to the home.  There was confidence that with proper oversight of the evolution of the contract which was undertaken, this would still represent a proper way to finalise a cost of delivering this.<\/p> <p>  The Department substantially geared up its resourcing to ensure that it could investigate in enormous detail the cost of different elements of a potential roll-out.  The Department has a high level of confidence in the various cost estimates that have been put in place, having shadowed much of the cost-estimation process.  The Deputy could argue, as many have argued, that it would have been better if two remained in the race.  However, given that two or more did not stay in the race, the Department took the necessary steps to ensure that this evolution would be invigilated to a point where there would be confidence in what was being proposed.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, it is up to Government to decide whether the costs that will now have been identified with the various riders, contract terms, qualifications, etc., represent a decision that it wants to go along with.

The gap-funding model was the right decision with the information that was available at the time.  However, is it not clear that as the circumstances changed dramatically when both Siro and Eir pulled out, there should have been a review at that stage?  The Government resisted all efforts by the Opposition to have a review at that stage because it was rightly identified on this side of the House that the Government was leaving itself open to one bidder effectively holding it over a barrel.  That now appears to have happened if we are to believe the rather well-informed leaks that we read frequently which suggest that the estimated costs have gone from &euro;500 million to somewhere close to &euro;3 billion.  Is it not clear that it was a failure on the part of Government not to intervene when the fundamentals changed significantly?<\/p> <p>  Is it not also the case that everyone's back is to the wall?  People are demanding broadband to be rolled out.  We are in the throes of an election campaign and people expect it to be delivered.  We are no closer to doing that because we do not know the ability of the remaining bidder to deliver.  The Department claims that irrespective of who might have won the tender, the same set of subcontractors would be doing the work.  However, will the success or failure of the contractor not be in the project management of such a large-scale project across wide geography with varying and difficult terrain?  Therefore the skill sets required are not just about splicing or tracking fibre along poles.  I know the Taoiseach has an issue in that he believes that fibre goes in the ground, but we will get over that.  As the Minister knows, it principally goes along poles.<\/p> <p>  Is the really important component of the bidder for this project not the project management piece?  I have searched extensively and I do not see the project management capability of Granahan McCourt, a private finance company based in Boston which has been very good at managing investments.  I would argue that its expertise is in buying and selling and not delivering projects such as this.  Over and above the mistakes that get made - I accept that - or the failure of the Government to intervene when it should have, the question now being asked, I think, is whether we should spend &euro;3 billion and bet the future of the 540,000 premises and homes waiting for broadband on a private finance company based in Boston in the hope that it will somehow develop the project management skills to make such a large-scale project viable.  After the decision to sign a contract, might we not find ourselves two or three years into it having to enforce some of the covenants for failure to deliver?  Would that not be an unmitigated disaster for the people still waiting for broadband?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#C00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I do not accept that mistakes have been made in the way this has been conducted.  To put this in context, over &euro;3 billion has been invested in providing high-speed broadband to urban communities.  All the contractors are committing to have fibre to the home in urban areas.  The decision in the programme for Government to adopt an ambition of having high-speed broadband available to every home so no one would be left behind was the right decision.  In the event, all the bidders proposed that fibre to the home was the most cost-effective way of delivering it.<\/p><p>At the point at which some of the contractors withdrew, the interrogation of what was being offered was well under way.  All three bidders had brought forward proposals in the competitive dialogue.  The Department had a strong understanding, therefore, of the parameters of the programme, the likely cost, the technology options and so on.  Eir continued to the penultimate stage.  Two bidders submitted proposals, which included their assessments of the subsidy required.  At the point that Eir withdrew, it was not at a very early stage, leaving one bidder with no benchmark against which its bid could be judged.  The Department had been involved in the process over a long period and one of the bidders had gone a significant distance down the road.<\/p><p> On the skills and project management required to roll the plan out, I assure the Deputy that at every point, whenever there was a change in the make-up of the consortium, there was a thorough reassessment of the capacity of the bidder to complete the project.  In many cases, the subcontractors to be used were identical for all the bidders.  It was not a question of hiring people with no experience.  The capacity of the remaining consortium was tested, as was required in the contract, to ensure it was capable of managing the process.  Nevertheless, we recognise that one of the criteria for the success of a project such as this, if it is adopted by the Government, will be the governance put in place by the State to oversee not only the contract but many provisions therein that are designed to protect the taxpayer.  We recognise that we will not rely exclusively on the company and instead we will have our own governance to protect the taxpayer.  We will undertake that work, which will provide a double protection for the State should it decide to proceed with the contract.  I understand the concerns, which have also been expressed by other Deputies in the House.  We have taken them into account throughout my Ministry and I have always cross-examined what is being done to be satisfied that we accommodate, recognise and take into account concerns raised by Deputy Dooley or other Deputies in our management of the situation.

Would he give any consideration to the charge that they pulled out because they were of the view that only &euro;500 million had been put on the table by the State and they could not put together a comprehensive business plan that made sense and that protected the assets of their organisations while also making a commitment to roll out high-speed broadband to the 542,000 homes?

It is estimated at about &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million.  A document prepared by this committee contained proposals on the future funding of public service broadcasting.  It examined putting control of collecting the licence fee into the hands of the Revenue Commissioners and some preliminary discussions took place between the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  That might pre-date the current Minister, but perhaps he might enlighten us as to whether those discussions have concluded and what conclusions might have been reached.<\/p> <p>  Moving to broadening the net for collection, we must examine the consumption of content, to use a rather crude term.  As the Minister knows, the strict definition of a television is what attracts the requirement to have a licence.  There have been major changes in technology and demands for content and much public service content is now viewed on screens not attracting the need for a television licence.  Has consideration been given to broadening the definition to ensure we are capturing the consumption of public service content and that it is being paid for?  There is always some debate about the television licence and the impact of raising the cost.  On the other hand, however, we must take into account how much people are now willing to spend on technology and subscriptions to Netflix and various other pay-per-view channels through Sky etc.<\/p> <p>  I still think the licence fee represents good value for money for what is being created.  It is often misrepresented that the licence fee is going just to RT&Eacute;.  Most of it does at the moment, but the independent production sector does well out of the sound and vision scheme.  That creative sector is important for the maintenance of our culture and for employment, and it could do much better if more money was available.  The Minister will also be aware, as we have discussed this before, of my wish, and that of the House in a recent Private Members' Bill, that public service news and current affairs, often created by the independent radio sector, be brought under the remit, or at least the funding model, of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There is a broader space where we can protect and preserve the quality of that content and ensure it is protected in future.  We must face up to the challenges associated with the business owned by our visitor to Dublin today, Mr. Mark Zuckerberg.  He is on a public relations tour and, I am sure, he is hoping to influence the legislation being drafted by the Minister.  I am also sure, however, that will be done independently without being influenced by the public relations spin and lobbying that will undoubtedly be hot and heavy.

The key element in programme C is support for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Much work regarding energy does not appear in the Estimates, however.  Examples include work done in setting a new goal for renewable energy on our grid or supporting the evolution of the grid to meet our ambitions for microgeneration or renewables.  There is no direct support from the Exchequer so that is not included in our Estimates.  It is, however, part of the national development plan and significant investment is envisaged.  What is in the Estimates is concerned more with the activities of the SEAI.  It has significant supports of which I think most Deputies will be aware.  Those include the better energy homes scheme, the better energy warmer homes scheme, the deep retrofit pilot, the solar scheme and certain schemes aimed at the enterprise sector such as the excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, programme for the large industry energy network.<\/p> <p>  The other initiative I always like to plug is the better energy community programme because it has the most bang for our buck in terms of impact on carbon emissions.  I know County Tipperary has a particular interest in this area because a very successful community scheme has been developed there.  Overall, there are 256 sustainable energy communities.  Some have gone the more in-depth route of being a better energy community, which involves a higher level of investment.<\/p><p>They are really valuable schemes and it should be our ambition to expand them in the years ahead.  The other thing worth mentioning is that the programme provides &euro;18.6 million to support the purchase of new electric vehicles.  The Deputy will have seen that there has been quite a surge in interest in the purchase of new electric vehicles since the beginning of the year.  The final piece to which I wish to draw the Deputy's attention is the figure of &euro;9.7 million for energy research.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#E00700","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I am okay with that.

Funding of &euro;2.75 million is provided for mining services, including some &euro;600,000 for mine safety and monitoring and to develop a detailed plan to facilitate further remediation on the Avoca Mines site.<\/p> <p>  The programme also includes an allocation of just over &euro;11.6 million for Geological Survey Ireland services, including &euro;7 million for the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  The Tellus mapping project consists of airborne geophysical measurements and ground geochemical sampling.  Data from the project will allow for improvement in geological maps, new radon mapping and agricultural mineral maps and will also facilitate better land use planning and research.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by the Geological Survey Ireland in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  Under the groundwater programme, Geological Survey Ireland's national network of Turlough flood level gauges will provide key data on Turlough flooding to OPW and the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Programme E provides grant funding to Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is responsible for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland's inland fishery resource.  Inland Fisheries Ireland will continue to deliver its licensing, permitting and enforcement responsibilities and the rehabilitation of our rivers and streams throughout 2019.  The delivery of a wide-ranging set of investments, innovations and promotions under the national strategy for angling development will ensure that Ireland's fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected and enhanced for both their economic value and their recreational benefit to the communities and visitors they serve across Ireland.  The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;19.9 million towards the staff costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  The Loughs Agency is a North-South body and is co-funded on a 50-50 basis by my Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.

They are generally 5% or 10% up or down on the previous year.  It is the general way things have gone.  I am not asking the Minister to look into the crystal ball for the next set of Estimates at which we will be looking but when it comes to Programme F, I can only hope that in light of the report that has come from the Joint Committee on Climate Action and the work being done by the Minister that the next set of Estimates at which we will look will not be in the ballpark of increases of 5%.  The Minister mentioned the &euro;500 million that is set out over ten years.  We are all coming to the realisation that there will need to be a seismic shift in that space.  While a couple of million is very welcome in terms of the Minister's announcement yesterday, we really need to be seeing really big announcements if we are to reach the kind of targets we need to reach for the deep retro-fitting of homes.  If we are to tackle the issue of trying to come into line with and have a meaningful impact on the transport and heating sectors, we really have to spend money.  I accept, and the Minister said it in public, that the Government will not be able to pay for this.  The taxpayer will not be able to pay for the kind of change that is needed.  We get that but it is going to take very significant financial incentives that will require the Government on behalf of the taxpayer to puts its hand in the pocket of the Exchequer and put it out there.  There is no doubt that investment in this area is really beneficial in terms of addressing our climate change needs but it will also enhance growth in the circular, or green, economy.  We need to change tack very significantly.  That will take investment and leadership and the only entity that can do that in order to show confidence that this is the track being taken is the Government.  I have no doubt that the Minister knows that but it will be about what the committee can do to assist him in convincing Ministers in other Departments that they must hold off on some of their expenditure in the short to medium term to steer the ship in a different direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#F00700","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>The Deputy makes a really important point about how we are going to move the dial.<\/p><p>He has acknowledged, as I have often said before, that Government cannot fund the level of change that we need.  Much of the change that we need is good in itself.  It pays for itself and produces a better, healthier environment and a more sustainable relationship with nature.  We will definitely have to think about how we persuade people to make the necessary investments.  I do not think we will always increase the grant levels in all cases by any means.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland sees grants as an entry-level method to prime the pump.  We need to come up with self-sustaining ways to fund it and ways in which we can get smart finance in and make it easier for people to undertake some of these investments.  It talks about behavioural economics and building out our capacities to leverage change.<\/p><p> Regulatory change will also have a role to play to get people to think differently, such as with the near-zero energy buildings or the requirement that all employers with more than 20 car parking spaces will have to have electric chargers by 2025.  Those sorts of nudges do not cost the State anything.  They may cost the private sector something but they are key enabling technologies for the sort of changes that we have to make.  Carbon pricing is another element of that.  When I drove in this morning, even though I have a plug-in electric vehicle, I was still generating carbon.  I am not paying for that carbon.  There is a case that setting a trajectory for carbon prices will help people to make decisions about whether they choose electric, go for retrofit heat pumps or whatever else they change.  There will be many elements in the mix to bring about the change.<\/p><p> With respect to the Deputies here, there is a sense that there is a broad political consensus that this needs to be done, is one of the challenges that we face as a community, and that we need to get behind the Citizens' Assembly as a process that has leveraged significant change in our community in the past, even things that we would not have dreamt of being possible ten years ago.  We have been able to mobilise change and the model that is being used here with the Citizens' Assembly followed by the committee's work has helped us to mobilise change by citizens and I hope it can on this occasion again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#F00800","speaker":"1293","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>With regard to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, there is an increase of &euro;2.1 million.

We were at that meeting.  Unfortunately, the timing clashed but it was important for our own work to attend that meeting.  I was then stuck in priority questions to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I will be running out the door shortly for another engagement.  No disrespect to the Minister or officials is meant; it is just one of those days.<\/p> <p>  I will make one broad point.  I think the Joint Committee on Climate Action, of which Deputy Dooley and 18 others are members, as well as myself, did really good work.  Even though there was not consensus on a couple of the issues about taxation, there was widespread agreement on some other measures.  Critically, it provides a good roadmap for how we organise ourselves and the governance of how we will make this leap.  I hope the Government will find it useful when it is drafting its national energy and climate action plan, or whatever it is called now.  I do not know if it is the same as the Minister's plan that is due out around Easter.  We know we have to do the national energy and climate action plan under European governance rules.  I am keen for the Government to open up that process so some of what we have learned from the committee can allow other Members of this House to tease out some complex and difficult issues.<\/p> <p>  These are Revised Estimates for the present time but the State, Government and this Department in particular should be scaling up and we should be looking at completely different Revised Estimates next October for the following year, and an almost completely different Department.  It should scale back and shut down the exploration division and switch some of the expertise and resources to peat restoration, for example.  I have said a number of times that the Department needs to scale up to do what we want it to do with regard to energy or programme F, environment and waste management.  That might include legislation needed for offshore wind licensing.  We have to be quick to get the resources for that.  I know from personal experience that there are approximately 250 or so civil servants in the Department.  I fear that is not enough.  We should be taking 300 officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and 200 from the Office of Public Works, and transferring them in.  We should build up a Department that is at the centre of this transformational leap that we need to make.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and his Secretary General suggested in this all-of-Government action plan that the Minister's Secretary General and the Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach have a key role in co-ordinating and organising transition on this scale.  I could go on about some of the governance recommendations for the next half an hour.  The key leap is not just the Minister's Department but pulling all the agencies and regulators with it.  We do things well in this country when everyone is on the same page and everyone understands that there is a long-term political commitment to the scale of change that we need to make.  We are getting close to having that.  I have been asking all along about where our Whitaker is.  We need a Whitaker today to provide the same sort of leadership that was provided in the past in our public service for the scale of change that we need to make now.  It is very substantial, it is urgent and it is almost agreed.  It is not fully agreed but there is a lot of agreement in our political system.  There is an opportunity and the Minister should go for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC12019040200002#G00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1554213600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ryan and the committee for the work that they have done.  It is right, as we have done in this case, to have the Citizens' Assembly followed by the Oireachtas committee and then a Government plan.  That approach has helped us to undertake significant change in other spheres of Government.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that our Department will need to considerably reorganise and expand its capability to take on this responsibility.  We are assessing the types of expertise we need ourselves and how we need to develop that.  Every part of Government must recognise that this is their up close and personal responsibility, not just the responsibility of a Minister who happens to have \"climate action\" in his or her title.<\/p><p>Everyone must understand that there is up close and personal responsibility for them, and it is not just the responsibility of a Minister who happens to have \"climate action\" in his or her title.  Unless we get that change, we will not deliver this.  The Deputy is right to signal T.K. Whitaker as being a light-bulb moment but interestingly there was not a massive institutional change that he instituted.  It was about a sense of conversion, confidence and self-belief, and about starting to plan to be ambitious, to set targets and seek to reach them.  That first paper that he produced and the first economic plan that followed it were not grandiose documents.  If we go back and look at them now, we will see how simple they were in many ways.  At the time, they were a light shining where none had been shining for many years.  This is something similar.  We must not think that we can push it over there and that is the job done.  I think the committee's report reflects that.  The governance is not about me or my successor reporting.  What is envisaged is for the committee to hold every Minister to account for his or her area of responsibility.  I hope our plan will reflect that.  Notwithstanding that, I accept that we need to beef up our capability.  I was involved in the Action Plan for Jobs process.  One of the things we did early in that process was bring the capability of Forf&aacute;s into the Department, so we had capability to drive and initiate change and interact with wider parts of Government.

The position is that there are two processes through which solar energy can evolve.  One is the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which is the successor to these refits.  We are now working intensively to develop the capacity to have an auction for that, to be scheduled for about the end of this year.  That will be a technology-neutral auction so whether it be solar, wind or whatever, people can come in and bid on a level playing pitch for access to the grid.<\/p> <p>  The second piece is the development of microgeneration, which has also been the subject of discussion in the House.  We are obliged to create a microgeneration framework under EU legislation by the middle of 2021 at the latest.  We are examining what it will take to create a microgeneration network.  It throws up some tricky enough issues around pricing, standing charges and so on, which we have to work through.  We are determined that microgeneration should be part of a mix.  It is really important that we encourage people to look at their own energy use and seek to replace what they are doing with renewables.  In some instances, they will have surplus to sell to the grid and that represents the scope for a price for that microgeneration.  Those are the two channels through which this is working.  They will be a significant part of our own plan but we also hope that we will be able to develop them.  There are a number of levers available under the RESS to prevent any one technology from dominating the whole pie, as it were.

I accept that it is eight to ten years out but if we look at what has happened in the last ten years, and I am not being politically critical here, very little has happened in terms of turning that dial.  There really is capacity to turn the dial if we can capture the offshore wind capability that we know is there.  It would be a terrible loss if we failed to take advantage of the opportunity, not just in capturing the energy but in capturing the investment associated with it and the potential run-off jobs that would come from that.  This is not going to happen by just getting lucky from an auction.  We will have to develop a clear policy ourselves, perhaps separate from the renewable energy piece, which would bring the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on board as well and would seize an opportunity and would put the supports in place.<\/p> <p>  It is about more than just meeting our demands for renewable energy.
