Last week, we had the pleasure of meeting officials from the Department of Justice and the Prison Service to raise a number of issues.  There is one issue that I had raised at our very first meeting as part of the main reason to bring them in  I refer to the fact that following the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 17 January 2019 I had raised the issue of an alleged sexual assault against an agency nurse working in the Prison Service.  I understood from Mr. Don Culliton, who represented the Prison Service last January and again last week, that they would look into the matter.  Since then, the person in question has taken a case to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and there has been a ruling.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the relevant Deputy, although not named but it was me, were named in the judgment.  It was found that as a direct result of the case being mentioned at our meeting on 17 January 2019 the person had all of their shifts cancelled so had to find alternative work and as a result was granted an award that is a matter of public record.  Naturally, when the Committee of Public Accounts came together first, I said that we should want to raise the matter.  While I appreciate Standing Order 218, which seeks to reaffirm historic limitations without any leeway, the Prison Service and the Department should have been in the invitation to last week's meeting under notice that we were going to raise that matter.  It is shocking that a court ruled that as a direct result of something being raised here, and a matter so serious as a sexual assault, would lead to somebody in the judge's opinion losing their job and getting compensation, appropriately.<\/p> <p>  Now it seems that the State is appealing the case.  The nature of how it was dealt with last week by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and the Prison Service was appalling.  It was totally unfair to the committee and totally unfair to the victim.  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Justice owes an explanation to this committee as to what their position is on having been found to be liable for taking action against somebody because a matter was raised at this meeting.  These are not my words.  That was the judgment.<\/p> <p>  Last week, we were stonewalled.  I think I used the phrase \"How people like Maurice McCabe ever managed to get justice is beyond me\" because if somebody in the Prison Service came to me with a complaint today I would genuinely advise them not to issue a protective disclosure, not to make a complaint and not to have it raised at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts because other apparatus in the State will move directly to throw them under the bus.  While I appreciate that I can be abrupt and robust in my questioning, which is unnerving for people and is probably unseemly to watch but it was necessary.  I am appalled at what took place at last week's meeting with the Department of Justice and the Prison Service because we were merely making up the numbers.  It was a total waste of taxpayers' money considering the lack of candour, directness and basic respect shown to what is the only constitutional committee in the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00300","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>People will continue to have a problem as long as the power imbalance has been shifted so much in respect of Standing Order 218.  It almost works against the committee and in favour of the witnesses so I do not see how we can continue, and effectively do our work, without change or a rebalancing of Standing Order 218.  We must redouble our efforts to do that.  It is like having a pair of handcuffs on and I found it quite difficult to straddle that in the Chair last week.  It is obvious that there has been a shift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I was not here last week but I am aware of the case where a judgment was made in favour of a former worker in the Prison Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I have raised Standing Order 218 previously and I said that the issue would become more prevalent and it has, unfortunately.  I am a new member of the committee and at the initial meeting, we were greeted with the new Standing Order 218.  From my understanding of the committee prior to joining it, the Standing Order has put the kibosh on our ability to question witnesses or certainly put pressure on the Chair to ensure that there is compatibility with the Standing Orders of the House.<\/p> <p>   I ask that the impact on our committee be analysed at the weekly meeting of the Oireachtas committee chairman and, indeed, by the Committee on Procedure, of which I understand I am now a member.  I really think it only impacts on this committee and not so on others.  It is imperative that we do that because when Covid is over and we have longer than two-hour sessions with witnesses, the impact of the Standing Order will come into shaper focus and be unfair to this committee.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy eloquently said, it will impact more so on us as committee members and favour those who are here as witnesses.  It is important that we deal with this matter as soon as possible, preferably in January, before the committee meets again.  I appeal to the Chairman, as the guardian of the committee, that we deal with this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00600","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My views on Standing Order 218 are well known.  I agree with what has been said about it imposing a stricture on us.  There are two issues with the Standing Order.<\/p><p>One interpretation is that it is there to prevent us from discussing matters that should properly be before another committee, such as the health or justice committees.  That is fair enough.  From my perspective as Chairman, I do not want to get involved in some kind of jostling match with the Chairmen of other committees or the committees themselves.  I am sure members are reasonable enough to know that there is no need for us to do that and that there are capable people on all the committees across the Houses.  That is one interpretation.  There is a procedure, where that needs to be adjudicated on, to send a request to the Committee on Procedure.  This is what we have been told legally.  There would be a turnaround time of a week.  I understand that this in the Standing Orders of the Committee on Procedure, which is welcome enough in itself.  <br\/><br\/>However, there is a bigger issue.  We have had witnesses before committee meetings, including Secretaries General, where things were completely free-flowing and there were no objections to asking any questions about anything.  In fact, I and other members asked one Secretary General not just about the past but the present.  We also discussed the future with him.  He was very forthcoming, which is his style.  I also know that in the case of other witnesses, I had to intervene to tell them they had to answer the question.  It can be used to close down questioning from members.  I do not want to preside over meetings like that.  It puts me in a difficult position and it restricts things.  I am not completely <i>au fait<\/i>with that particular issue but from members are saying here, I take it that this problem has popped up and we need to try to circumvent and deal with it.  The Deputy is correct.  This committee is the one that will be restricted.  Constitutionally, the Committee of Public Accounts is the one place where we can bring people before us to get answers, to discuss and analyse what is going on and to issue reports.  It is important that we do not restrict that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00700","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Last week was a prime example of the effects of Standing Order 218 and how it ties the hands of committee members.  The whole purpose of the committee involves its probing nature and accountability systems, practice and procedures.  Because of that Standing Order, witnesses who may have felt that they were coming in for quite a grilling if there was justification relating to practice and procedures will be only be too happy.  I do not see how it serves the purpose of this committee.  It would serve witnesses who are not forthcoming with information when requested.  Regarding the practice whereby witnesses refuse to answer continues, if we had a penny for every time we were told last week that someone could not answer this or that question, we would be rich.  If it is not changed, it will continuously make the purpose and remit of the committee more and more redundant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#G00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As a member of the committee, I take exception to what the Chairman said about him as Chairman and other committees not having to jostle over certain issues.  I think the Committee of Public Accounts does trump a number of committees.  They may decide they want to discuss certain issues with certain witnesses but from the point of view of public accountability, we should have the privilege of inviting witnesses in and discussing certain issues irrespective of whether another committee also wants to do that because we cut through the issue of whether it has a certain departmental aspect, be it health or education.  We can still invite them in and it is important for this committee to retain the ability to do that.  Standing Order 218 affects our ability to question those witnesses.  Irrespective of whether any other committee has standing in the House to do that with that organisation, we should still be able to do that.  I would not like us to lose that ability.  I would like us to retain it and through the Chairman, I would like us to push for that more.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, of all committees, this committee needs to ensure that Standing Order 218 has a better re-balancing for committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#G00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.

We have a problem in the sense that over 2,500 organisations are getting funding from the HSE.  I remember raising an issue relating to an organisation that I wanted to invite before the Oireachtas Committee on Health but we were advised that we could not get it in because the Committee of Public Accounts was dealing with section 38 and section 39 organisations, which I thought was wrong.  In fairness to the Committee of Public Accounts, it could only deal with one or two organisations at the time with regard to cross-examination, whereas the Committee on Health could easily have dealt with other issues.  We need to be careful that we do not prevent other committees from looking at other issues.  Regardless of whether organisations come under the remit of the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Health, we should not prevent other committees from pursuing other aspects.<\/p> <p>  The Committee of Public Accounts still has fairly extensive powers relating to accountability.  The one difficulty we have is that where there is any litigation involving an issue coming before us, it is impossible to deal with any of that.

As it was within the remit of the 2019 accounts, Standing Order 218 was not an issue.  A peculiar angle that was taken that we do not discuss individual cases.  I do not know any law against that.  That might be a practice that is adopted but if we have an individual case, for example, a protected disclosure, there is nothing in law that prevents the relevant Accounting Officer saying &quot;we got that, we're working through that and here's what happening with it.&quot;  There is nothing to prevent that but that has become the practice.  The practice is we do not discuss individual cases.  My view is that we do not have to accept this practice, the practice needs to change and we need a more candid approach.  If some is<i>sub judice<\/i>, that is a different matter.  That applies to all committees.  The question is, was the Prison Service told, as it should have been, that we would be discussing this?  As a matter of basic professionalism, the Secretary General should have come in shouting from the rooftops that it was aware that we were central to a case in which it was found guilty and which it was appealing and the reason it was appealing the decision, because this committee would be entitled to know that.<\/p><p>On the issue relating to other committees, this is the only constitutional committee of the State and it does trump every other committee.<\/p><p>The reality is that we are entitled to talk to any Department or agency that spends public money and is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

They were getting an awful lot of money from the State and we were entitled to quiz them.  It can be a bash to the ego.

There is some uncertainty around it at the moment.  It is unclear what exactly was specified on the invite but the committee secretariat will revert on that in the coming days.  In terms of what we do then, if members want the committee to correspond with the Secretary General of the Department or the head of the Irish Prison Service to express their dissatisfaction with what took place at the meeting, that can be done and we can seek to have them before us again.

I believe that it is an over-the-top interpretation and that it went in the wrong direction.  It is missing the point altogether.  We need to see where we stand legally on that.

That is likely to be a very strong feature of the accounts for this year, which we will look at next year, given that so much had to be bought very quickly.  Would the Comptroller and Auditor General be looking, for example, for the risk analysis?

I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Laura Bambrick.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has widely exposed the failings in how we protect workers' incomes when an interruption to earnings occurs, the lack of statutory sick pay being one of the most glaring examples.  Almost all of the EU 27 member states require employers to provide a minimum period of sick pay to their workers.  With the exception of those covered by a sectoral employment order or employment regulation order, workers in Ireland have no legal right to sick pay.  Sick pay is at the employer's discretion in a contract of employment.  As a result, hundreds of thousands of workers, mainly in the private sector, including many essential workers, are not covered for sick pay.  They face being forced out of financial necessity to continue to work unwell or to rely on social protection.  Illness benefit is onerous to access and inadequate for most workers' needs.<\/p> <p>  The trade union movement has long recognised that our voluntary sick pay provision is not working.  However, it took a pandemic to bring the long-standing flaws in the current arrangement to wider attention, in particular clusters among meat plant workers denied paid sick leave by highly profitable employers.  On foot of our calls for legislation to make sick pay mandatory, significant public and political attention followed.  The Government has committed to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme by the end of 2021.  In our submission to the public consultation, a draft copy of which we have provided to the committee for consideration, we set out our recommendations on key design and operational features which must be included in any new scheme.  In the short time I have available for my opening comments, I will focus on the most fundamental consideration to be decided on.  This is how the cost of statutory sick pay is to be shared between employers and the State.<\/p> <p>  It is commonplace in European statutory sick pay schemes for employers to be responsible for the continued payment of the worker's wage, in full or in part, for a minimum period of absence due to sickness or injury.  In the group of high-income European countries, of which Ireland is a member, the duration of statutory sick pay ranges from two weeks to two years.  Typically, it replaces all or nearly all of the worker's wage.  If the sickness lasts longer than the statutory sick pay entitlement, a social benefit is then paid by the state from social insurance contributions.  Financial measures are in place to support businesses in meeting the cost and for cases where there is a genuine inability to pay.<\/p> <p>  Our unusual practice of social insurance funding sick pay from the outset exposes the Exchequer to greater liabilities than those countries with a statutory scheme.  Department of Social Protection officials estimate each week of employer-funded statutory sick pay would reduce the draw on the Social Insurance Fund by &euro;35 million.  This money could instead be funding other social benefits for workers.  At the same time as employers shift responsibility for paying their sick workers exclusively onto the Social Insurance Fund, their contributions into the fund are markedly below employer's contributions in wealthy western European countries.  Raising employer taxes, including social contributions, to comparator averages would have collected nearly &euro;9 billion in additional receipts at average tax levels in 2018.  ICTU recommends that the new statutory sick pay scheme should follow the EU practice of employers paying for an initial period of absence followed by benefits paid from the Social Insurance Fund for the duration of sick pay where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  ICTU does not underestimate the scale of the economic fallout from Covid-19 and is acutely conscious of the significant challenges facing some businesses.  We view the proposed gradual introduction of the scheme, starting with a modest scheme that is improved on over time, as warranted in principle.  Nonetheless, the pace of the introduction of the full scheme should not be unduly prolonged, as businesses with a genuine inability to pay can be supported in meeting their obligations through financial measures.<\/p> <p>  Finally, having convinced Government of the necessity to introduce statutory sick pay, the priority for ICTU is now to deliver a fit-for-purpose scheme.  We favour a scheme which does not serve to displace current collectively agreed sick pay schemes, which will improve working conditions and protect workers' health and incomes, which will replace the current voluntary approach to sick pay with a statutory obligation on employers to provide a minimum period of sick paid leave, and which will bring workers' basic entitlements into line with European norms.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for its attention, and we are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King and invite Mr. McDonnell to make his brief opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We understand the desire of the Department and the members to extend to workers the availability of a statutory sick pay scheme.  The then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection paid out &euro;13.64 million in illness benefit to 49,000 people in 2019, an average of &euro;276 per person.  However, we note the equivalent in the public service on the basis of a 4.2% sickness rate in 2019 cost &euro;381 million.  Any system of statutory sick pay that relaxes the rules currently applied to illness benefit would result in a far higher cost for statutory sick pay.  Presumably, it is the intention of the House that employers bear this cost.  Sick pay is a material cost for many small businesses, especially those that have to hire temporary replacement labour.<\/p> <p>  There are public comparisons being made in this consultation to rates of sickness benefit being paid in other EU countries where social contribution rates are far higher.  If we want higher personal benefits, we must be willing to pay for them via employee PRSI.  We also acknowledge that our social insurance system is not social insurance in the terms meant by our EU neighbours.  Employer and employee contributions, which used to be capped, are no longer.  However, benefits are capped. This is not how true social insurance systems function.  This is how tax systems function.  <\/p> <p>  Workers earning less than &euro;18,304 make no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  They make a payment of &euro;185.90 as a universal social charge, USC, which some people wish to get rid of.  Many part-time workers fall into this category.  We think it is valid to ask workers who want to avail of social security benefits to make a small contribution to them.  This means we must socialise those costs elsewhere.  If we are going to have a conversation about social insurance entitlements, we need to have an adult conversation about how we fund them.  Putting the burden on employers will simply increase the cost of labour with knock-on implications for annual incomes.  <\/p> <p>  We spend &euro;3.5 billion annually on the pay as you earn, PAYE, tax credit.  Should we revise this?  While Ireland is already heavily and overly dependent on income tax, Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, has previously proposed, and does so again this morning, a solidarity tax of 3% on all PAYE incomes over &euro;100,000.  This would bring PAYE workers in line with high earning self-employed persons, and it would generate &euro;314 million per annum.  Whatever way we choose to fund statutory sick pay, let us not make it a burden on employers, and let us not borrow more money to fund it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I now invited members to discuss the issue with witnesses.

We are well aware that for some businesses, the cost of labour is a decimal percentage of the cost of sales.  Let us be honest; there are some highly profitable mostly multinational companies working in this country for which this does not present an issue.<\/p> <p>  On the other hand, there are small businesses in the service sector where the cost of labour can be north of 50%.  The National Competitiveness Council puts it at 86% in some businesses.  I refer to what one is faced with when someone who is entitled to statutory sick pay is in a small business.  I acknowledge we are having a discussion in the abstract about what percentage of daily or weekly pay that is.  In a small business, if one takes, for example, somewhere where the service has to be delivered by a person physically being there, such as a hairdresser, a barber, security function, coffee shop and what not, one is not merely looking at the statutory sick pay but also the replacement cost of labour.  In businesses which are marginally profitable, that is a significant cost, which potentially makes the delivery of that service on that day loss-making.  <\/p> <p>  We are not suggesting there are businesses that could not pay an element of statutory sick pay.  The worst-case scenario would be an inability-to-pay clause but the reality of some of those European countries that have been quoted earlier is that they have significant rates of employee social insurance - up to 20% in the case of France - so these things have to be paid for somewhere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>In the event that an employer cannot pay, it is surely reasonable that there would be a cannot-pay clause.

Mr. McDonnell made reference in his submission to the perceived lack of contribution by those who earn less than &euro;18,000 a year.  It is pretty obvious those people are not earning enough to be able to make a substantial contribution but the notion that there is a mechanism for employers to be able to assess their own capacity and have their capacity to pay assessed is very important.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms King and it relates to the waiting days.  Can she outline the impact of this for members?  It is pretty clear that if a person is unwell but goes to work because he or she is driven there by his or her financial circumstances, that is not good for anybody.  It is not good for the person him or herself and it is most definitely not good for the people with whom that person is working.  Replacement costs have been talked about but the replacement costs of one person can escalate into replacement costs for multiple persons in the event of somebody going to work when he or she is not well.

I took part in all of the discussions with Government officials in respect of all of this when the pandemic first occurred.  The Deputy will be aware that it adjusted the six waiting days that were in place and so on and so forth.  The collectively bargained agreements contain a variety of provisions with regard to waiting days.  The Deputy will be well aware of the provisions, for instance, in the public sector sick pay agreements and so on, where it just does not occur, full stop.  If people become eligible to receive payment for illness, then they go into that scheme and that is how there are paid for the duration of the illness.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view, ideally there should be no waiting days.  When people are ill, they have to have income.  One clear issue arising in the pandemic was that people were going to work when they were unwell because they could not afford to stay at home and waiting days were a contributory factor.  That is the reality.  As waiting days mean that someone will receive no income, when a person is on very low wages and every cent counts it can therefore have quite disastrous effects.<\/p><p>From our point of view in the consultation, we are trying to get the point across that illness benefit should cover the illness because the illness does not wait for a day, two days or three days.  From that point of view, the illness benefit should do what it needs to do which is cover the worker for the period he or she is out sick.  On some occasions there will be some differences.  Currently the system is quite onerous if one talks about State payments.<\/p><p> One of the benefits of an employer having an obligation is that whatever we agree at the end of this, the employer will continue to pay for a period.  In other words, the issue of waiting should no longer be appropriate or should not even arise, quite candidly, if we get into that scenario.  If we take a person on maternity leave, for example, the day that person goes on maternity leave she gains the benefit of the maternity leave.  In many cases, as the Deputy will know well because she negotiated many of them, workers have top ups from employers.  They also apply from day one and then the State payment kicks in, so there are a whole variety of ways and means to do this.  That comes into play in the construction sector where sick pay is on a daily basis.<\/p><p> We are in a public consultation process and hopefully we are going to be engaging in many discussions under the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, system with the Department on what the final outcome of this will be.  From a starting point, the illness benefit should do what it is meant to do.  The employer has an obligation and a break in wages should not occur if that obligation is met.  That is our point of view on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We learned a lesson from when the sick pay scheme in the public service was slashed.

They have both made valid points that the committee needs to try to understand as it tries to shape this.<\/p> <p>  From ICTU's point of view, where there are collective agreements around sick pay, is there a rule of thumb around how the cost is shared in contributions between the employee and the employer?  Would that be any guide to this issue of how we should try to divide up the relative costs?  In a sick pay scheme, the State will be a significant player as well.<\/p> <p>  Things are changing in terms of the responsibilities of enterprise.  The more volatile nature of employment and the need to invest more in staff means that employers will take on more responsibility for training and for illness arrangements.  From ISME's point of view, have SMEs learned any lessons from the Covid-19 period?  I know Mr. McDonnell talked about the cost of absences but a sick person with Covid-19 coming into the workplace would be a disaster for the workplace.  There has been clear merit in having some arrangements so that people feel confident staying at home.

Is it the duration or the waiting times, etc.?  That is apart from the issue of the cost.  Mr. McDonnell raised the valid issue of the replacement of absent staff being a cost.  It is a cost that we need to think about in terms of the design of a scheme.

By and large, collective agreements usually cover a certain number of weeks.  There is no real provision for a contribution in most of the collective agreements but I would give an example of another collective agreement that does.  For instance, in construction there is a small contribution from workers every week on an ongoing basis.  It is something in the order of cents that is paid into a fund, which then pays out for sick pay, in the order of about &euro;44 per day for someone who is sick.  Most of the collectively bargained agreements would include the provision, much like the maternity leave system, that when State payments kick in, they are refunded back to the employer.  That would be the same in the public sector as well.<\/p> <p>  We are strongly arguing that sick pay paid by the employer should be a condition of employment.  A strong argument has been put forward about labour costs and the increase in same and so on.  I fundamentally disagree with the argument made by employers because if one goes into business, a company cannot go to the ESB and ask for a lesser price for electricity because it is small, for example.  If one goes into business one should be able to counter and deal with the cost of a decent wage and decent terms and conditions.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view, we pay a big bill in this State for the privilege of low pay.  One in four workers in this country is low-paid.  It cost the State just under &euro;1 billion in 2018 to supplement the income of low-paid workers to try to keep them out of the worst levels of deprivation.  That is the price of low pay to this Government and State.  The answer of employers to this is that either the worker should pay through extra tax or PRSI, or the State should pay more money to the employer to put this condition in place.  We fundamentally reject that.  Workers going to work and giving of their labour should be given a decent rate of pay and should have decent conditions.  We regard sick pay as a decent condition of employment and it should be paid for by the employer.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McDonnell is right about having an adult conversation.  That is the piece of the adult conversation we should have.  When one looks across Europe, they have much higher employer contributions for social insurance but their social wage benefits to workers are much better and those states do not have the large level of bill that this country has to uphold employers paying low wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I will follow up on some of the questions the Deputy asked me.  One of the stand-out lessons from Covid-19 goes back to the philosophy of sickness and unemployment benefits as a charge on the social welfare system.  We saw that when the temporary wage supplement scheme was introduced at the start of the pandemic, the payment to workers making more than &euro;76,000 per year through the system was &euro;0.  We should contrast that with countries in continental Europe.  For instance, if someone loses one's job in Denmark, the payment can temporarily be up to 80% of one's salary.  That tapers down to a national basic payment but the principle is that caps on salaries were removed a number of years ago.  The benefits are capped, however, and that is fundamentally unfair.  That is one of the lessons we learned.<\/p> <p>   I will give an example of the high wage costs for businesses.  We represent many people in the personal grooming sector.  The UK has brought in an element of statutory sick pay and in some hair salons in the UK that has meant that salon owners have moved away from employment and what they are doing now is renting the chair.  The outcome of that, which I am sure ICTU would not like to see happening either, is that people who were previously employees are forced to become contractors, generating their own charges for their services and then renting the fixed assets from a salon owner.  That is an example of what is happening on the ground and what those in the grooming industry brought to my attention when I shared this proposal.<\/p><p>In terms of waiting days, there is one element that plays against that.  In the scheme of the management of a statutory sick pay scheme, currently one has a State payment made after day six.  To understand the impact of waiting days and so forth, in the case of a person who is on a daily rate of pay of X per day, what percentage of X would be represented by sick pay and what percentage of that could be recovered from the State that is currently covered by the illness benefit scheme?  Unless we can see meat on the bone in the proposals, it would be difficult for us to deal with issues such as that.<\/p><p> ICTU has actively advertised the benefit of the scheme in the Netherlands, which is up to two years.  Employees who avail of that are put into quite an intrusive return to work and health recovery protocol, which some people might not like.  Second, SMEs can avail of insurance.  The State insures and underwrites the cost of that for them.  It is not an inability to pay.  It is more a question of how one does that.  Does an employer tell the State that he cannot afford to give two weeks' sick pay to that person?  Do we just simply adopt an insurance measure that would be far more practical and sensible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>We certainly do not want people to feel that they have to go to work when they are sick for all kinds of reasons such as lack of pay, loyalty to the company or whatever else.  The other side of that coin is that we do not want people abusing the system by taking so-called sick days either.  There are two sides of the coin and it needs to be balanced.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by how some of the large companies deal with this.  Diageo, for example, offers 26 weeks' paid maternity and paternity leave to its employees.  Other large companies offer significant perks.  This idea of looking after one's employees is important.  Many employers are beginning to realise that to retain talent, they have to look after employees very well.

From my experience on the Low Pay Commission, it is interesting that since 2000, 20 years on, not one claim has ever gone before the Labour Court where an employer was unable to pay.  There is a reason for that.  The provisions of the Act state that an employer must prove he cannot pay.  In other words, the employer must open his books.

They know very well that paying a decent wage and offering good conditions is the manner in which they will retain their employees and that they will get a much better return for the company as well.  That is tried and trusted.<\/p><p>It is now accepted by all of the major bodies that that is a fact of life.  I do not think it would be an easy job to reconcile our position in regard to this, which is that decent work includes a decent rate of pay.  People cannot live on the minimum wage.  It is about &euro;2.20 per hour below the living wage.<\/p><p> Terms and conditions of employment are a matter between workers and employers in the first instance.  Therefore, the obligation on employers to provide sick pay for their employees is a term and condition of employment.  Somebody in business has that judgment to make about affordability and having proper wages and conditions.  Those are very serious considerations that an employer has to make when he or she undertakes to employ people.  The very strongly advocated view from the employer side for years has been that they pay wages but other social matters such as pensions and sick pay are not a matter for them, they are a matter for the State.<\/p><p> Mr. McDonnell asked earlier what the Social Insurance Fund is for.  I can tell him that one of the primary uses of money from the Social Insurance Fund is the provision of a State pension.  Some 70% of the fund is used to provide a State pension to people because they have no other access to a pension and would be in total poverty if there was not a proper State pension in this country.  Those are some of the pieces that also come from the Social Insurance Fund.  I do not know why Mr. McDonnell is questioning what the Social Insurance Fund is for.  It is going to be in deficit.  There is not any doubt about that.  That is the reason we welcome the very good debate that we hope will happen.  I agree with Mr. McDonnell that we will have an adult debate about how sick pay should be funded, but we are fundamental in our view that it is an obligation of the employer to pay sick pay to an employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#F02800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank ISME and ICTU for their presentations.  I apologise if some of my questions have already been asked.  Unfortunately, I was delayed at another event.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. McDonnell and ISME.  I very much welcome the fact that ISME supports the call for the statutory right to sick pay in this country.  That is progress, but I am not sure that the demand that employers pay nothing towards it stands up to scrutiny.  I am struck that his predecessors would have made the very same argument against paid annual leave 70 or 80 years ago, before we had a right to paid annual leave in this country.  My understanding is that there are three types of employers.  There are employers who can afford to pay sick pay, and do.  There are employers who can afford to pay sick pay and choose not to.  Then there is a cohort of employers who are just about getting themselves back up on their feet at the moment and are obviously struggling to make ends meet.<\/p> <p>  What research has been undertaken by ISME on the affordability issue?  Mr. McDonnell talks about the costs to an employer from a statutory right to sick pay.  What share of firms would require temporary replacement cover if a person falls ill?  In some organisations two people have to do the job of three people if somebody is out sick.  In other firms, that is simply not possible.  What share of his membership require temporary replacement cover?  Of the member organisations of ISME, what is the average number of sick days among their workforce on an annual basis?  Does he have any idea of that?  We need to understand what is going on within his representative body in order to take his concerns seriously.

If an employee's entitlement to annual leave is X number of days per annum, that becomes a structured, costed part of his or her remuneration.  Any entitlement to statutory sick pay would have to be treated in the same way if a company was not to go bust, especially those that are more labour dependent.<\/p> <p>  Not being in receipt of any State moneys, I am afraid we are not in a position to survey membership about how many sick days employees take per annum.  We are one of the very few associations one will talk to here that is not in receipt of direct State subvention, so we do not have the resources to do that.  I would love to do it, if the Houses wish to resource me to do it, but I am not in a position to do it.<\/p> <p>  As to those entities where replacement is a necessity, that is very much a sectoral question, but I will give a broad answer.  Typically, people in an office environment are not replaced when they go sick.  In a lot of service entities, staff who are sick must be replaced because the service is sold at point of delivery, so if a cleaner, a security person or a hairdresser does not show up then one cannot deliver the service and therefore there is no turnover.  In those types of service industries, replacement is typically 100% and then there are other areas where it is mixed.  In construction, if one of a number of bricklayers on a site is missing then the work slows down for the day, but if the crane operator is missing then the crane does not work unless a replacement worker is found.

I accept that.  We have to remember that our cost of labour, our national minimum wage, is driven by two factors.  The first is the costs of goods and services, and business charges, which we know are high.  The second is the size of the social wage, which is very low in Ireland.  The social wage is the cost of education, healthcare and public transport.  The reason it is so low is that we spend, on average, approximately &euro;3,500 less per person than comparative EU countries.  The reason for that is that our intake from employer social insurance is comparatively low.  If we do not take in more in employer's social insurance contributions to fund the social wage, the cost of wages is driven up.  The cost is being paid, one way or the other.  Investing more in the social wage will keep us competitive and introducing statutory sick pay is not lose-lose for business.<\/p> <p>  I am not responding in particular to what the Deputy just mentioned but we have heard a lot about absenteeism, moral hazards and how to ensure that people are not abusing the system.  It is one of the great paradoxes that the more generous statutory sick pay is, either in terms of replacement rates or in the low number of waiting days, the lower the level of absenteeism.  That might sound counter-intuitive but the reason is that if people get the opportunity to get themselves better when they have a small ailment, it stops the sickness or illness from festering and becoming a bigger health issue, thus necessitating more time off.  <\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my earlier contribution, statutory sick pay is normal practice across our European partners, including Northern Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p>They also have small businesses.

The report builds on previous work carried out by the Irish Maritime Development Office in the area and it updates the land bridge study, which was delivered in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The report takes account of important issues, including, but not limited to, market conditions, including trade and tourism volumes, capacity and utilisation of maritime transport services, and emerging trends that may influence demand and supply conditions in the future.  The report considers the desirability of State intervention in the shipping industry, taking into account lessons learned in dealing with this question over the past two years.  The report also takes account of recent industry consultations and emerging national and international influences.  The report concludes by updating previous advice and making a series of recommendations, laying particular emphasis on a contingency approach that recognises the complexity and uncertainty of current circumstances and the value of scenario planning in preparing for the unexpected.  The recommendations we make are cautious and prudent, cognisant of the important and serious implications for the national economy and vulnerable sectors within it of failing to protect maritime connectivity.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with some key points in the report.<\/p><p>I will outline the structure of the presentation.  The presentation gives an overview of freight volumes through Irish ports.  It then focuses on roll-on-roll-off, ro-ro, and lift-on-lift-off, lo-lo, traffic or on a combined basis unitised traffic, which are really the areas of concern when it comes to Brexit and Covid-related challenges.  We look at demand and supply factors and discuss the case for State intervention in the shipping market.  I will conclude with summaries and recommendations from the report and inform the committee about a communications campaign that has been running to alert the market to the necessary preparations for Brexit it should be undertaking.  <br\/><br\/>The graph in front of members tracks volumes through Irish ports over the past 13 years.  It relies on the iShip index, which is an aggregate measure of volumes through Irish ports.  The graph is set at 650 so, in many respects, what members see on the screen amplifies the effect but it will give members a clear understanding of how volumes have moved over the course of the past two years in particular.  Members can see that there has been a tapering off in ro-ro volumes, particularly as we came into 2020 and Covid had its effects.  As volumes are at that level, and members can see at previous points on the graph that they were often much higher in Irish ports in the past, there is sufficient capacity in Irish ports to handle forecast volumes.  This gives a more detailed monthly analysis of ro-ro volumes, which is an area of particular interest when it comes to discussing Brexit and land bridge implications.  What members see in this slide is a comparison between 2019 and 2020 monthly carryings through Irish ports.  The blue bar represents 2020.  From the beginning of the year, volumes were running behind last year's levels.  When Covid started to take effect as we went into March, April and May, volumes fell very significantly.  There were points when ro-ro volumes on some services and in some ports were 35% to 40% behind last year's levels.  The decline was not evenly distributed across all ports and all services.  Some services suffered to a greater extent than others.<br\/><br\/>As we moved through the year, particularly in July, September and November, we can see that volumes exceeded last year's levels.  In July, we were coming out of a lockdown period where demand was suppressed because of the restrictions.  As these eased, volumes increased.  In November, it was noteworthy that volumes were significantly ahead of last year's levels.  This is important because our view is that those volumes contain a significant amount of traffic that is building stockpiles in Ireland in preparation for the effects of Brexit.  This is a phenomenon we have seen in previous deadlines as the effects of Brexit came into play and the market took steps to mitigate those risks.  <br\/><br\/>In this slide, members will see the effects of Covid-19 on the passenger business through Irish ports.  They can see that in quarter 2, volumes in the Republic of Ireland were down by 91% while in Northern Ireland, they were down by 83%.  For the island as a whole, volumes were down by 88%.  This phenomenon of suppressed passenger demand and reduced numbers of cars travelling, particularly on ro-ro services, frees up space on those services for freight.  As we head into 2021, our expectation is that passenger volumes will remain suppressed and the space made available because of the absence of passenger cars will contribute to the response of the shipping industry in respect of services with increased volumes of freight were that to occur.  <br\/><br\/>I will discuss some of the demand characteristics of the market.  This slide deals with economic and seasonality effects and some of the effects of stockpiling.  As we head into 2021, economic forecasts suggest a slowing down in the Irish economy.  This will reduce freight volumes.  As we move through this stockpiling period and enter quarter 1 of 2021, the likelihood is that volumes will be reduced as we eat into those stockpiles and those stockpiles are used to meet demand.  In any event, volumes are generally down on peak demand in January of each year - sometimes by as much as 20%.  This occurs routinely for seasonal reasons.  <br\/><br\/>On the supply side, it is interesting to note that there has been significant investment in the market over the course of the past number of years.  Notable among those investments were Irish Ferries' investment in the <i>MV W.B. Yeats<\/i>while CldN made investments like the <i>Selene<\/i>.  These represent very significant increases in capacity.  These vessels were launched on the market as Brexit-busting vessels that offered significant additional capacity when needed on direct services to the Continent.<br\/><br\/>Overall, in the course of the past year, we have seen significant additions to capacity.  Up to this point, six new services have commenced.  Members will see on the screen that eight more services are planned for 2021.  These are either new services or expansions of existing services.  This represents a significant response from the market.  Looking at the route map that outlines the services that are available, members can see the services outlined on the map here representing four different shipping companies and eight different services.  This does not take account of the services that are planned to commence early in 2021.  <br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that lo-lo capacity also makes a significant contribution on an annual basis.  In 2019, more than 1 million 20 ft. equivalent units, TEUs, were moved between Irish ports and continental ports.  The lo-lo industry is notable because it uses vessels that are not as specialised as those operating in the ro-ro market so there is greater availability.  Operators have the ability to increase size.  Given the prevalence of chartering in the lo-lo market, vessels can be off hire and new vessels can be taken on.  Lo-lo has been shown to be a viable alternative to the land bridge with appropriate supply chain adjustments.  That is something to which I will return as we look at other services because there are substitutes but the substitutes that work in terms of accommodating land bridge business require supply chain services for them to work effectively.  On the lo-lo side, members can see the route map.  There are nine different companies offering 23 different services.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand the structure of the shipping market in Ireland.  There are relatively low barriers to entry so it is open to new entrants.  The market is served by a number of large high-quality providers - leading shipping companies in Europe and the rest of the world.  The industry is capital-intensive so the participants in the industry have some costs creating an imperative to generate revenues to meet those costs so the industry will follow demand.<\/p><p>The industry and the market are highly competitive.  There is a history of investment to retain and grow market share.  I have referenced some of the investments in the recent past, and they are ongoing.  The industry has a history of good service and meeting market needs, and it has responded commendably in meeting Covid challenges and demonstrating its resilience.  Our shipping services and port companies have kept going, and they are to be commended for this.<\/p><p> The market structure supports the view that the industry will respond to changes in demand based on commercial imperatives.  On the supply side, the big question, and what is not entirely clear, is the extent to which the land bridge will continue to function.  Undoubtedly, there will be delays and disruptions at UK ports, and we are taking that as a sensible working assumption and advising importers and exporters accordingly.  In the communications campaign we have been running for the last two months, we have been highlighting this and asking importers and exporters to take appropriate steps.  However, the Dover-Calais route and, indeed, the services provided through the Channel Tunnel, are important trading arteries for the UK.  The shipping industry believes that Dover-Calais and the Channel Tunnel will overcome the problems and will continue to provide services, notwithstanding its acceptance of difficulties on 1 January, as the users of the system develop an understanding of the new circumstances.  It is not in the UK's interest for Dover-Calais to fail and it is in its rational self-interest to do everything possible to ensure that it works.<\/p><p> Demand for land bridge services is relatively inelastic, and this is a conclusion we reached in the land bridge report.  Even with some increases in cost and time, there was still significant demand for land bridge services.  We tested this out in regard to delays of up to 12 hours, although beyond that it definitely becomes more difficult to see the extent to which the land bridge will continue to be used.  Nonetheless, inelasticity has been tested out to 12 hours.  Land bridge traffic existed before the Single Market and with customs controls, and I am old enough to remember that.  In those circumstances, it did provide a competitive option for importers and exporters.  We are cautioning, however, that some sectors are heavily reliant on the superior speed of the land bridge, and as the alternatives are not capable of delivering the speed or the flexibility of the land bridge, this means that alterations to supply chains are necessary under those circumstances to make the alternatives work.<\/p><p> On the supply side, we tested our assumptions through consultation with the industry, and those consultations have been ongoing over the course of the last nine months.  What we have found is that there is surplus capacity on all routes and there is a desire in the industry to meet emerging demand, which I described earlier as a commercial imperative.  There is some support for a collaborative approach.  We recommended in the report that we should test the extent to which participants in the industry can collaborate to provide greater coverage and greater frequency for users, and this met with some success in that there have been some announcements in regard to ferry companies operating on different days of the week to provide greater coverage.<\/p><p> We are operating in a benign charter market, so if additional capacity needs to be brought in, it is available in a reasonable time period.  When we look at response times, which are dealt with in the table on the right-hand side, we can see four levels of response.  First, the industry indicates that it has surplus capacity which is available immediately.  Second, it indicates it can alter schedules to provide additional capacity and that is possible within a one-day to three-day time period.  Third, it can redeploy vessels within the respective fleets, which can take up to a week.  Fourth, it can charter in, and that process can take between two weeks and a month, depending on the circumstances in the market, the availability of suitable vessels and so on.<\/p><p> Turning to the case for State intervention, particularly in light of recent developments, we are asking is there a need for State intervention, and if there were a need, what would it look like.  Our understanding is that it would require the State to go to the industry to provide the capacity that is needed, and that it is the self-same industry that is indicating clearly that it will respond in its own way and is capable of doing so.  There is no evidence of market failure at the moment, and we have seen that through the variety of different responses that I have outlined.  If there were to be intervention, there is a risk of market distortion and a risk of doing lasting damage as a result.  There is a risk of breaching state aid guidelines and a risk of legal challenges, such as those that occurred in the UK when an attempt was made to intervene in the market.  The evidence supports the view that the market will respond as I have outlined.  The shipping industry is opposed to State intervention and the response of the shipping industry is demonstrably good, so the conclusion is that the case for State intervention has not been made successfully at this time.  We fully acknowledge that, in extreme circumstances, State intervention may be required but our contention is it is not required at this time.<\/p><p> In summary, freight demand in January will be lower than normal because of economic considerations, because of the stockpiling that is currently ongoing and because of seasonal factors.  Supply of capacity will be higher than normal because of the interventions in the market by the industry that I have mentioned, both from incumbents and from new entrants.  The evidence shows there is surplus capacity on all routes.  The market will be motivated to respond to emerging demand because of the structural issues in the market that I have outlined.  State intervention is problematic.  Holding out the prospect of State intervention in a functioning market is also potentially damaging because it creates an expectation and it can delay the spontaneous response of the market.  However, importers and exporters must &ldquo;ACT now&rdquo;, and this &ldquo;ACT now&rdquo; phrase is an acronym for &ldquo;assess, communicate and trial&rdquo;, which has been part of an ongoing press and radio campaign that has been running for the last couple of months.  We are asking importers and exporters to assess their current arrangements in order to be sure they will work as we go forward, to look at the alternatives and to assess those as well, to communicate their requirements to shipping companies so the steps that shipping companies are capable of making can be taken in advance, and to trial the alternatives and not leave that to 1 January.<\/p><p> To conclude, the recommendations in the report are that State intervention is not required and that we should maximise industry collaboration to overcome the challenges we face.  That is a process that is ongoing and is part of the consultations we have been having and continue to have with industry.  There should be scenario and contingency planning.  That process is ongoing and we are involved regularly with the Department, teasing out different scenarios and planning for the unexpected to the extent that is possible.  We have looked for a commitment from the shipping industry, and we have taken a different direction on this than in the UK.  A capacity framework was put in place with the Department of Transport and we have gone directly to industry and asked it to prioritise vital supplies, such as medicines.  The response was very favourable and a protocol has been put in place that will give access to officials from the Department of Health to shipping companies if there is a difficulty, and shipping companies have agreed to prioritise the response.  We recommended a communications campaign and I have outlined that this is already ongoing.<\/p><p>We have recommended that we closely monitor developments in other member states and in related industries, such as aviation, to ensure that developments there do not place the maritime industry at a disadvantage.  We have recommended that measures taken in those industries, and in other member states, should be applied in Ireland if and when they are applicable and beneficial here.  We also recommend that there will be ongoing monitoring of market conditions.  Such monitoring has been a feature for at least the last two years as we prepared for Brexit and when the Covid pandemic took an effect at the beginning of this year.  We now operate a weekly monitor and update the Department with that information each week.  We consult regularly and that was weekly with industry, shipping companies and ports.  As many of the problems that we faced have been resolved, the meeting schedule has been extended so we now meet as required.  Suffice to say, the monitoring of the market and our engagement with the Department on that issue has never been more intense.  By way of information, I hold aloft the flyer that is being used to encourage importers and exporters to act now and take the necessary steps for assessing, communicating and trialling.  That concludes my presentation and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey for his presentation.

It would be helpful if we could have the Powerpoint presentation as it would make our follow-up work a lot easier.  The movement of goods has been an issue since long before the referendum because people identified the need to focus on Ireland's direct shipping links with our biggest market that is continental Europe.  A move away from the land bridge is something that would have always needed to worked on even if there was no Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I have questions on issues that were touched on in the presentation but I believe that we should use this time to go into a bit more detail about the issues that small business owners all over the country have conveyed to us as their public representatives.  The delegation has spoken at length that there is sustainable capacity.  Is there really roll-on, roll-off capacity?  I was taken aback by the focus on the idea that space has been freed up due to the decline in the number of tourists.  Is it sustainable to use that space?  Please God, the tourism industry will be back and I know lots of people from the Continent who look forward to returning or coming to Ireland for cycling holidays or whatever.  I would like the witnesses to allay my concern.  <\/p> <p>  When we talk about the importance of roll-on, roll-off services and shipping to the Continent, it is not just about the destination ports.  It is the ability to travel much further inland into new markets, particularly when one thinks of the resources that the Government has put into opening a new Enterprise Ireland office in Frankfurt in Germany.  It would great to have new economic chanceries in all of the EU 27 member states and to really tap into the potential of the continental market but that requires long distance haulage to get goods to market in those places, which is an issue that is tied to the land bridge.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Lacey mentioned in his report, or perhaps I have seen it elsewhere, that there is the potential for delays to last up to 12 hours.  To what extent has the IMDO engaged with the UK port operators such as in Holyhead, Folkestone and Dover?  I ask because last weekend worrying scenes of trial runs were broadcast on television, etc., of Kent and other ports in the UK.  Although the trial runs were the result of the impact of work done in France as opposed to the UK, there have been numerous media reports that the UK is not Brexit ready, particularly when it comes to exports and imports.  The gridlock experienced at Dover, Folkestone or Portsmouth could be far worse than what has been speculated with Brexit.  What is the knock-on effect on Irish exporters that are trying to get their goods to market, some of which must drop their goods at British destinations before continuing into continental Europe?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Lacey has mentioned the outreach that has been done with exporters in terms of encouraging awareness.  I am concerned about the time pressure on fresh food exporters and seafood producers in Galway, for example, who only have a set period of time to get their goods to the fish markets in northern France.  There is potential for a 12-hour delay with the land bridge and we know how long direct ferries take to sail across to France.  What supports have the industry and the IMDO put in place to allay the fears of our exporters?  It is all well and good talking about their need to diversify and consider other options but if either the land bridge or direct shipping is not the answer, then what is left for the exporters?  Anyone who works in the fresh food, time sensitive area must be accommodated.<\/p> <p>  An awareness campaign was mentioned but I do not feel that, which is not a slight on Mr. Lacey.  I have spoken to a lot of industry groups, chambers of commerce, exporters and SMEs and they are up against it in terms of dealing with the pandemic.  We have often talked about Brexit preparedness in general terms.  It is very hard for a small company that produces a niche product and perhaps employs three employees to also have a Brexit officer when its managing director is also the head of sales, head of human resources and maybe even the chief cleaner at times.  They may think that the land bridge is fine at the moment but we all know that the situation will change drastically on 1 January.  We all hope that there is a deal in the next day or two but the situation will change drastically, which has permeated the real discussion.  How can we convince the people who are not in a position to appoint a Brexit preparedness officer that there is merit in direct shipping to their markets?  I know that any exporter will tell anyone that their biggest issue is assuring their client and customer that a product will arrive on time.  That level of reliability and guarantee is so important.  When one considers all of the things like cost, price and standards it is the guarantee and level of importance that matter.  The campaign for direct shipping needs to be backed up and tripled because Brexit is like a lot of things in that it is only until one experiences it that one realises all of the problems.  We cannot ease off on getting prepared come the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#F00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I want to ensure everyone has time to contribute so I ask Mr. Lacey to keep his responses as trimmed as possible yet take as much time as he needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#F00400","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>On the issue of the return of passenger business to ferries and the impact that may have on the capacity of ferries to carry freight, we are very hopeful that there will be a significant return of passenger business because that is the lifeblood of RoPax services but it is somewhat unlikely in the first quarter.  I make that point because it gives us some relief from the problem and the absence of passenger business helps.  It is the desire of the industry and our desire that the passenger business will return as quickly as possible, and sooner rather than later, because it is needed.  As that begins to happen, the industry is capable of responding by introducing more capacity.  I have outlined four different responses by the industry and the introduction of additional capacity is the one that takes the longest time.  That can be done.  As the implications of the return of passenger cars to RoPax vessels and the timeframe become clear we can go back and rely on a response like that from industry.<\/p> <p>  I hope that the Deputy will agree that the response by industry over the last six months and the response that is planned from the beginning of 2021 are very significant indeed and will produce sufficient capacity to meet the needs of diverted land bridge traffic.  <\/p> <p>  What is key is the comparison or substitute ability of other services for the land bridge.  The key issue is that the land bridge is the fastest route to market.<\/p><p>That speed cannot be replicated on other services.  In using other services, it is necessary to accept that compromises will have to be made.  It is necessary to accept that there will be some changes to the supply chain because the speed of the land bridge cannot be provided by those other services.<\/p><p> There is another key ingredient, which is the frequency that is possible using land bridge services.  On the Irish Sea, the services that make up part of the land bridge system are those that operate principally between Dublin and Holyhead and those that operate between Rosslare and Fishguard and Pembroke.  On the Holyhead routes, there are up to eight sailings a day.  On the Rosslare routes, there are four sailings a day.  These 12 sailings give options to land bridge users seven days a week.  We cannot replicate that with direct services to the Continent.<\/p><p> The use of direct services to the Continent will be more concentrated.  There are fewer services.  The total land bridge business is a maximum of 150,000 units per annum.  The total amount of business using roll on-roll off, ro-ro, services to and from Ireland in 2019 was almost 1.2 million.  Therefore, land bridge represents 12% of the total.  It is impossible to produce the frequency for 150,000 vehicles that can be produced for 1.2 million vehicles.  We have to accept that there will be less frequency on direct routes and importers and exporters will have to adjust to that.<\/p><p> I am presenting the facts and what represents the next best alternative to the land bridge.  There are a number of different options, all involving changes to supply chain.  The options are direct routes to the Continent.  With a new entrant from January on Rosslare to Dunkirk, we get a model that is closer to what the land bridge delivers because it is delivering traffic into that part of France.  Dunkirk is only 40 km from Calais.  That is a notable addition.  We have other additional services out of Cork into Zeebrugge, and we have Stena Line announcing an additional vessel in January between Rosslare and Cherbourg.  These are all important developments.<\/p><p> Through those developments, we certainly have sufficient capacity.  We have argued heretofore that sufficient capacity exists in the system because there are other services linking Dublin and Zeebrugge and Dublin and Rotterdam that rely mainly on unaccompanied movement of goods, but they are viable substitutes for the land bridge.  Our call to the market is, if people want to protect their business, they should be aware of all of these options, that perhaps a portfolio approach to the range of services that they use is the most appropriate, and that they use different services as appropriate to protect against difficulties in other services and spread the risk in that way.  Being aware of all of the different options gives choice to importers and exporters and improves frequency.  If the speed of transit is increased, and it will be in using any of those other services, there are changes to supply chains that need to be made.  That could mean developing buffer stocks on the Continent in warehousing, etc., to deal with the demand.<\/p><p> Turning specifically to the question of fast-moving perishable goods, and often high-value goods fall into the same category of needing to move quickly, the land bridge is categorised by the movement of perishable goods, which are often of high value.  There is a difficulty there.  The next best alternative does not overcome the difficulty but there must be changes in the supply chain if we are to overcome those problems.  Therefore, a renegotiation of delivery patterns is absolutely embedded in the choice of any of the other alternatives.  This is possible because we know that those alternatives for lots of different types of traffic are good substitutes.  I accept that there is a problem with traffic.  I mentioned it in my presentation.  That is heavily reliant on the transit time of the land bridge because that cannot be replicated by the alternatives.<\/p><p> I was asked as well whether we are monitoring events in other ports, and we are.  There is contact all the time, through ourselves and through the Department, on how matters are proceeding in other ports that are important to Ireland.  We report on that regularly.<\/p><p> It is concerning that as we head into Brexit, there are trials taking place in UK ports and there is talk of disruption, etc., but to a great extent we expected that to happen.  What is unclear is how long lived that will be and how quickly UK ports will return to normal operations, albeit with the requirement for customs controls and inspections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey.

Mr. Lacey has said that the market is sufficiently flexible.  Obviously, this is something that Mr. Lacey is much more <i>au fait<\/i>with than I am.<\/p><p>Mr. Lacey spoke about the land bridge existing before the Single Market.  I would argue that it is a far more complex world for imports and exports than it was at that time.  Mr. Lacey also stated that there is surplus capacity.<\/p><p>Deputy Richmond and, I am sure, others will deal with how we have heard, from the National Audit Office in Britain, of the absolute lack of preparation.  We have all seen the tailbacks.  We have heard the worries that the Irish Road Haulage Association has.  We also had the port companies before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks in the past while on the idea that there is a traffic management system that involves the port tunnel possibly being used as a slow-moving carpark that trucks just keep driving around until space opens up.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that Mr. Lacey talks about communication with other ports.  Does that mean we could deal with problems, such as the one that has been pointed out to us whereby Calais's IT system was prepared too quickly and does not allow for goods from this State coming through Britain as a land bridge?  That seems like it will be a significant problem and will cause chaos on top of chaos.<\/p><p>In fairness, Mr. Lacey has spoken about a conversation with stakeholders and that there will be a need for adjustments to the supply chain.  I want to know what exactly that has consisted of and who are the stakeholders.  I assume that should be the hauliers, the ports and the ferries, but it also needs to be the business sector.  In fairness, Deputy Richmond spoke about the fact that there are certain goods, particularly fresh food, that needs to be delivered within time.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that there are new ferries for direct delivery, but sometimes the problem with them is the length of time they take.  I would say many businesses involving almost every good operates a just-in-time scenario that is based on the speed of delivery available to them at present, and I am not sure that full preparations have been made.  I want to know what conversations Mr. Lacey has had with all these stakeholders.  I understand we do not know exactly what Brexit we will have but we know it is bad.  Therefore, there will be a considerable operation relating to checks, difficulties, etc.  I want to know what Mr. Lacey's plans are, what consultation has happened, with whom it has happened, what is prepared into the future to ensure we can mitigate whatever we can, and that we have some level of operability with imports and exports across Europe from 1 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#G00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The UK land bridge existed before the Single Market.  I take his point that imports and exports are perhaps a lot more sophisticated now than before.  The technology we have for dealing with customs declarations and so on has also changed.  I would make that point, however, that there is an opportunity to rely on technology to mitigate some of the problems.<\/p> <p>  I cannot comment on the detail of traffic management in ports, especially the traffic management system for the Port Tunnel and Dublin Port.  The Deputy indicated that he had meetings with representatives of the ports and I am sure he has had responses from them on that matter.  I am aware, through engagement with the ports over the past year, that they have been working tirelessly on this problem.  Systems have been put in place, or are in the process of being tested, in Dublin Port and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  With regard to communications with industry, since the publication of the report under discussion here we have spoken to representative groups, including IBEC, the Irish Exporters Association, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, the medical devices and pharmaceutical industries, and groups that are linked to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including business and innovation, where we took a session with lots of different stakeholders entering the conversation there.  We also had stakeholders enter the conversation in the session we did with the Irish Exporters Association.  That contact has been ongoing.  In our normal work we engage with the groups to discuss these questions and to try to find the best solutions.  On the issue of finding the solutions for individual sectors or individual importers and exporters, I am not sure that we can help to any great extent in communicating with them, but we can direct their communications to the ports and the shipping companies because they are the actors that can make a difference in this scenario.  If importers and exporters are articulating new demands or different requirements, shipping companies are capable of making adjustments to the frequency and capacity of their services, but that conversation needs to take place.  We have been urging that conversation, going back to a forerunner of the Assess, Communicate, Trial, ACT, campaign in 2019 and a campaign called Be Prepared for Brexit, which dealt with all of these issues.  In the room on that occasion we had representatives of industry, importers and exporters.  We were advising the same sort of approach - that one needs the actors who can make a difference to be talking to each other.  We have been urging that.<\/p> <p>  On the timing of deliveries and the sophistication of supply chains, I understand that point fully, but I believe we must accept that if the land bridge is a lot slower and if we have to rely to a greater extent on direct services, then things change.  We cannot replicate the speed of the land bridge using direct services.  There is going to have to be adjustments in the supply chain and just-in-time systems.  Just-in-time systems operate around the conditions that apply in different parts of the supply chain.  If goods cannot be delivered any sooner than two days, is the just-in-time system into which those goods feed capable of adapting?  Those conversations need to take place again.  I hope this addresses the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has a brief supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#H00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>With regard to technology, I am afraid that the solutions are not there.

Perhaps the State intervention should force a proper conversation - perhaps force is the wrong term - around a renegotiation of what will work for businesses, ports, hauliers and ferry companies.  It could be just a case that everybody is waiting until they see what happens, at which point it will be too late.  Any intervention that the IMDO could make to that would be beneficial.

There was a degree of confidence expressed to me about the ability of Calais to respond.  It is important to differentiate between new systems that are being put in place that are going to have teething problems as they are unfolded, and the long-term effectiveness of these systems.  There is no question that on day one there is going to be significant disruption.  I have never seen port development or new systems being introduced that did not cause that problem initially.  With time, practice, and readjustment, and given the necessity to make these things work, we can be more confident that these issues can be resolved than the Deputy is expressing.  It is in the interests of all parties to resolve them.  In the end, if one is introducing barriers to trade, customs inspections, and health inspections and so on then it is going to take longer to progress through a port.  This is a fact that has to be accepted.

The IRHA has taken issue with the report.  I am not going to go into that now because I suspect that there are others here who will do that.  I have two secondary questions in my capacity as a Deputy for Dublin Bay North, which is adjacent to Dublin Port.  The first question was also referred to in earlier contributions, which is the traffic management plan in and around the port.  I believe that Mr. Lacey said he did not want to comment on that and perhaps it is for other agencies, but I am aware that Mr. Eugene Drennan from the IRHA will say later at another Oireachtas committee that we need a new entity to deal with the traffic congestion issue.  Currently there is a traffic management group under the aegis of the Department of Transport, which includes representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of Public Works, the Revenue Commissioners, and the Dublin Port Company.  Does Mr. Lacey have a view on that?  I believe it is too late to set up a single entity.  This problem is on our doorstep.  We need to proceed with the traffic management group that is in place to deal with any problems arising in traffic congestion.  If it is not a matter for the IMDO then that is fine, but perhaps Mr. Lacey will comment on the proposal from the IRHA for a single entity.<\/p><p>This is a secondary question in terms of the overall issue we are dealing with here.  It relates to Dublin Port.  Does the office have a remit for the physical capacity of Dublin Port from the point of view of space and future development?  The residents of Clontarf, whom I represent, have had a very uneasy relationship with Dublin Port, in particular due to the proposal to infill 52 acres of Dublin Bay.  Does the IMDO have a remit for the future development of the ports from the point of view of physical space?<\/p><p> I saw a newspaper article again this week about the possibility of developing Bremore as a port.  I recall the late Deputy, Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, calling for the complete relocation of Dublin Port to Bremore.  I would not have gone that far.  I am interested to know whether the office has a remit in that regard and if the witnesses think the Dublin Port Company has enough space for anticipated future development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#H00600","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Haughey.  Regarding the traffic management plans and their detail, with respect, I am not in a position to answer the question but I have general comments that I am happy to make.  Dublin Port has developed satisfactorily and has met economic needs in the Dublin area, the hinterland around Dublin and the demands of the national economy for many years.  The port has ambitious plans for the future that will take place within the general footprint that is available to Dublin Port at the moment.  Significant efforts have been made at Dublin Port to move non-essential activities outside the port to free up the land in the port for what one might call core trade purposes.  That has been a welcome development.  Overall, we have seen these plans introduced effectively and implemented well within Dublin Port.  The port has been efficient in the way it has gone about those things.<\/p> <p>  These are my observations as an outsider.  I have a degree of trust in Dublin Port that it can deal with traffic management issues and that the people in Dublin Port are best positioned to engage in that activity.  I do not know the detail of Mr. Drennan's proposals on a single entity to deal with the traffic issues in Dublin Port.  Dublin Port and the people in it are very experienced and are and should be highly motivated to resolve this problem.  I think that should be the locus of attention for this problem, but I would welcome the proposals being put forward by Mr. Drennan, insofar as I would be very happy to read them and see exactly what they entail.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the physical capacity of Dublin Port and its future development, a lot of the development in our ports in recent years has been driven by some of the tenets set out in the national ports policy.  The policy has tiered our ports.  We have three tier 1 ports in Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes, two tier 2 ports in Waterford and Rosslare and then ports of regional significance.  The national ports policy has had the effect of generating economies of scale in the tier 1 ports, and has done so very effectively.  Volumes have grown very significantly in the tier 1 ports as a result of that concentration.  In terms of generating efficiencies and economies of scale, I think the national ports policy has been effective.  The policy is going to be reviewed in the next year or so, and that is the appropriate time to look again at the distribution of capacity around the ports in Ireland.  It is encouraging that we have alternatives being put forward by the Port of Drogheda on the Bremore project.  We see significant developments on the drawing board in ports like Rosslare and there are developments under way in the Port of Cork.  As the sustainability agenda takes more of a hold in terms of how maritime transport and road transport happens in Ireland, the importance of regional ports and ports outside of Dublin may very well increase.<\/p> <p>  These are general comments.  The question the Deputy asked requires much more detailed analysis.  I am quite sure that that will be provided for in the review of the national ports policy when it takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey.

Mr. Lacey talks about the fact that we had the land bridge before we had the Single Market.

I do not believe Mr. Lacey engaged with the IRHA in conducting his review.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the ACT campaign launched on foot of this report, every importer and exporter had to go to their logistics provider for a solution.  It was at that stage that the IMDO report was released.  There was very negative engagement on the fact that the report said we had sufficient capacity and that no intervention or extra services were required.  Vehicles were being left behind as direct services left both the week after the report was released and the week before.  They were not able to access direct ro-ro services to mainland Europe.  This contradicts the report and I ask for comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#K00500","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The Deputy has put a number of questions.

The Deputy will have seen the response within the market over the past year.  Our role is to ensure there is a level playing field and that new operators can enter the market and compete <i>pari passu<\/i>with incumbents and that they are at no disadvantage.  The supports we offer obviously do not extend to providing commercial advice or anything like that, but they extend to making information available so that a would-be new entrant to the Irish market can make a judgment as to the prevailing market conditions.  I am not at liberty to comment on the engagement we have all of the time with companies that are interested in establishing in Ireland or in adjusting the services they offer in Ireland because those matters are commercially sensitive and we have to protect that information.  I am not sure what lies behind the Deputy's question but we deal with all comers fairly and honestly.  We create a picture and present information to enable them to evaluate opportunity.

Does Deputy Harkin wish to speak?  No.  That is fine.  As Mr. Lacey will be aware from our previous interaction, I was concerned about the report when it was published.  I was of the view that it was overly complacent with regard to the real pressures that would come on the land bridge in even the best circumstances and with regard to its complete disruption in the worst circumstances.  I was concerned that we had not prepared for that.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  With regard to the recommendations Mr. Lacey has again presented to the committee, other than the communications campaign, the general recommendations basically amount to advice to watch and wait.  We have dealt with various stakeholders with regard to Brexit and there does not seem to be anything proactive in these preparations.  He asserted that we cannot replicate the 12 daily sailings to the UK, but we could replicate quite a number of them and have done so.  Since our previous interaction with the IMDO, the number of scheduled direct sailings from Rosslare Europort has quadrupled.  That indicates that there is significant market demand.  There is also a new player, although it was indicated that the existing players had sufficient capacity.  That is my understanding of the report.  Despite this, DFDS has entered the market with an initial three new vessels that will sail from Rosslare to Dunkirk from 2 January, as Mr. Lacey indicated.  There is obviously demand.  I spoke to representatives of DFDS on the day it launched this new schedule of sailings and the company had received immediate inquiries, including a request from one very big logistics company for four containers on every sailing.  There was obviously very significant unmet demand.  I am glad these new services have come to meet this demand but I am still not convinced there will be sufficient capacity in the event of significant disruption, which may still potentially arise.<\/p> <p>  To move on to my final point, in Mr. Lacey's presentation he said that it is not in the UK's interest for the Dover-Calais route not to work.  That is self-evident but it will not be direct action by the UK authorities that stops the route.  If, as has been indicated today, agreement on fisheries remains a real pressure point, there is at least the potential for French fishermen to disrupt the unloading of British ferries at French ports.  There are real issues that have not, in my judgment, been substantially addressed in the report or in Mr. Lacey's presentation.  I am interested in hearing his comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#K00800","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>In the Vice Chairman's opening comments, he used the word \"complacent\".  I do not accept that in any way.  We have been working non-stop on these issues since the commencement of the Brexit problem and even more intensively as deadlines approach.  The final deadline is now approaching.  I assure the Vice Chairman that there has been no complacency.  Our approach has generally been to allow the market to respond and to steer clear of State intervention.  My view is that this is a good approach and that it has produced the results we have seen.  What would the circumstances be like had the State intervened to support a service, an individual operator or a group of operators?  What would the response have been from the industry, which has invested heavily and which is prepared to continue to invest and to respond to market demands?<\/p><p>That would have caused a chaotic response and we could have had grave difficulties.  The spontaneous desire of an industry and of participants in that industry are lost in order to solve the problems of the market in such a scenario.<\/p><p> On being proactive, we have been proactive all of the time in the advice we give to the Department and the Minister and in our engagement with the industry, which has been ongoing over the past two or three years.  There has been a non-stop engagement over that period to try to understand, tease out and address problems.  All of this was compounded by Covid-19 since the beginning of 2020 and that intensified that communication with industry.  There has been no lack of communication with industry, therefore.  Our role is in the maritime industry and we have been engaged in a concerted way with the maritime industry throughout this process.  Through colleagues in the Department, we also have access to a broader range of issues that are involved in the Brexit problem that relate to what is happening with Revenue, clearance procedures and engagements with other agencies and Departments that have concerns and issues.  On all occasions, those issues are processed and we try to find solutions and move on.  That has been part of our work in recent years and it continues to be a significant part of our work.<\/p><p> On the new entrant to the market, I am delighted that has happened and I have expressed my views about that.  The news of this new entrant immediately went up on our website and it was pushed out to the market we serve and the contacts we have.  The new service offers a different solution that brings traffic closer to Calais than previous services have done.  The promoter of the service is working with the assumption that this will capture a significant chunk of land bridge business.  If that is the case, we wish it well.  It has been able to enter the market because there is a level playing field and because it will be able to compete on the same basis as everybody else.  We have tried to ensure that this remains the case.  That has resulted in this new endeavour of the DFDS ro-ro service to Europe coming into the market and as I said, we wish it well.<\/p><p> There is an important issue with the substitutability of some of the services that operate on direct routes to the Continent.  There is a concentration on ro-ro, as if it is the only mode of access to the Continent and as if driver-accompanied solutions to the Continent are the only solution.  It is not because we have seen higher growth in recent years in the use of unaccompanied trailer services to the continent.  That growth has been satisfactory and at a faster rate than ro-ro services and the same is true of lo-lo services.  These alternatives provide solutions and I am not saying this is any partisan way.  I am just laying the information before the committee.  These services work and it is in the interests of Irish importers and exporters to know that these services are there and to evaluate whether these services can make a contribution to them meeting the needs of their customers.<\/p><p> I will go back to the issue of overall capacity.  Capacity is a function of the volume of a vessel and the frequency of sailings.  It is a mathematical equation so it is not an entirely difficult thing to calculate capacity.  When that is matched with demand, the evidence is there as to whether there is surplus capacity and the extent of the surplus capacity.  We have carried out that analysis.  When I spoke about the range of direct services to the Continent, I outlined that there were four different operators at the time of writing and now there are the additional services that we have spoken about.  When one looks at capacity across those services and when one adds in what is planned for January, there is sufficient capacity to carry the land bridge business.  That is an irrefutable fact.  The question remains as to whether the frequency and the points of arrival and departure of those services are sufficient to satisfy the market.  If these new services can do that, they stand a good chance of doing well in attracting land bridge business and if they do not, there are other alternatives.<\/p><p> When one combines these alternatives and when one encourages importers and exporters to be aware of the range of solutions that are available, that is when Irish importers and exporters are most protected.  Putting a portfolio of solutions together with one solution countering the risk of another makes for effective solutions.  That is what we have been encouraging for quite some time, going back to 2019 with the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign, the launch of which at least one member of the committee attended.  I hope that answers some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey for his comprehensive reply.

I am back to the same question of whether the State intervention and the involvement of the Irish Maritime Development Office should have a more proactive and collaborative approach to ensure there is a conversation between the ports, ferries, hauliers and representatives of business, as much as that can be done.  We all accept there will have to be changes and moves but we need to ensure that everybody can get enough out of it and that is accepting that some of these measures will have a cost factor and other factors will be involved.  If we were to listen to the port companies previously, they did not want to get into the conversation but they said that they had engaged with the ferry companies and it suited the ferry companies to operate at the times they operate, which creates difficulties for ports and hauliers in the sense of three or four ferries all arriving at the one time and the gridlock that would cause in a normal time.<\/p><p>If we are talking about 1 January on, it could be absolute bedlam.

If one is stepping outside a known system, namely, the land bridge, that has a transit time of, say, 18 to 20 hours, all the alternatives are slower.  One therefore needs to work around that by renegotiating supply chains and making the necessary adjustments.  To do otherwise would be just to bury one's head in the sand and hope it will be okay.  We are very much of the opinion that importers and exporters need to know the realities, including the realities of the alternatives that are available to them, so they can make those choices.  We have been advocating this for a very long time.<\/p> <p>  In the report a recommendation is made on scenario and contingency planning.  In that process, and with the Department, we have looked at and continue on an ongoing basis to look at what might happen.  If the market does not respond in the way in which we want it to respond, what happens then?  It is entirely unhelpful, in the context of a functioning market, to set out a priority that there will be State intervention because the market is demonstrably capable of doing its job.  I do not say this because of any misunderstanding of how the shipping industry behaves.  I am very familiar with the shipping industry.  I know it is driven by commercial imperatives and not by a sense of altruism.  It will do what is in its interest from a commercial point of view, and it is in the interest of shipping companies to follow demand and to service that demand.  If that demand is not being adequately serviced or if there are superior ways of addressing the demand, new entrants are free to come in.  That very much characterises the response from DFDS.  There is an operator that feels it can provide a better solution than the solutions currently available.  I assume that that is the premise of its business plan, that this will be successful because it will do things better and differently from current operators.  If that is the case, it will succeed.<\/p> <p>  As for the operating times of ferries, and in response to a question from Deputy Verona Murphy earlier, I alluded to a previous career with Irish Continental Group.  With the issue of scheduling and the timing of arrivals and departures, one deals with mobile assets.  These things can be changed, but one changes them in response to market conditions.  It is a particularly difficult thing with ro-pax services, where the interests of both passengers and freight are combined on one single service and there is an attempt to strike a balance that will meet the requirements of both markets.  It is less difficult with freight-only operators, which can attend to the singular requirements of a freight market without having to consider the requirements of a passenger market.  Again, my experience with the market is that the times that deliver most for consumers are the times during which shipping companies operate.  There is no logic in suggesting they would want to do otherwise.  They operate at times when the demand is at its maximum and they satisfy the greatest number of customers, whether freight-only customers or a combination of both freight and passengers.  I hope that helps with Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I will take a brief supplementary contribution from Deputy Verona Murphy.

This marks the first time I will do so in my role both as Minister of State with special responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance and as a member of the new subgroup on insurance reform under the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  It is important to listen to and consider the views of as many key stakeholders as possible.  This committee plays an important role in holding the Government to account in this regard.  Accordingly, I look forward to today's engagement on this issue.<\/p> <p>  Since taking up my appointment in July 2020, I have had a series of meetings with a number of key stakeholders.  These include the chief executive officers, CEOs, of the largest insurance companies in the Irish market, the Alliance for Insurance Reform, the State Claims Agency, Insurance Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Bar Council of Ireland, the Central Bank, Brokers Ireland, Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  I discussed with them the Government's insurance reform agenda and asked them to outline what opportunities and challenges they see at present.  I hope I will hear the committee's views today on the various opportunities and challenges, as all Members of the House have a common interest in moving forward on the insurance agenda.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that much work has taken place in the area of insurance reform over the past four years.  Indeed, in 2016, the committee produced its own report on the cost of motor insurance, which fed into the cost of insurance working group's report in the Department of Finance.  Both the committee and the cost of insurance working group found that there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance.  This position remains true.<\/p> <p>  I will outline progress to date on the cost of insurance working group reforms.  Members will be aware that this group published its last progress report on 30 October 2020.  It showed that the majority of its recommendations were implemented.<\/p><p>These included improved transparency through the introduction of the national claims information database, the implementation of the Personal Injuries Commission recommendation to replace the book of quantum with the new personal injuries guidelines, the strengthening of requirements to co-operate with PIAB and civil liability law changes to make it more difficult to make fraudulent claims.<\/p><p> It has been shown that these reforms have largely stabilised the motor insurance market.  The data from the CSO and EUROSTAT show reductions in the cost of private motor insurance of about one third since 2016.  I would like to recognise the contribution of all sides of the House on this issue.  Without cross-party support, I genuinely believe many of the issues might not have been able to be progressed to the extent that they have.  This is an example of how, when we work closely together, we can make progress.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, more needs to be done.  We are all aware of the stories from businesses, charities, voluntary groups, childcare operators and leisure operators of the increase in public liability insurance.  This includes a series of inconsistent awards levels for injuries.  In some cases, injuries appear to be relatively minor but this inevitably creates difficulties for the businesses, such as cr&egrave;ches and play centres, in securing insurance thereafter.  In addition, data from the national claims information database demonstrates that Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, settlements in recent years continued to decrease.  This is despite it being shown that PIAB represents a much more cost-efficient and time-efficient settlement channel than going through litigation.<\/p><p> Our economy and society need a stable and affordable insurance environment.  The programme for Government recognises this and sets out a range of commitments to reform the insurance sector in Ireland, including reducing the size of personal injury awards, increasing competition through new entrants and enforcement, improving transparency and minimising the need for costly litigation through reforming the system.<\/p><p> It was also recognised that, to address these issues, a whole-of-government approach was needed.  In order to achieve this and to elevate the reform agenda to a group closer to the Cabinet, the Government decided that a subgroup on insurance reform, under the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, would be the most effective vehicle to drive the implementation of these commitments.  The subgroup was formally established at the end of September and is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and it also includes the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Michael McGrath, McEntee and O&rsquo;Gorman, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and myself.<\/p><p> One of the first tasks of the subgroup was to commence progressing a number of key areas of reform and to produce an action plan.  The plan was launched on 8 December by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and myself.  The action plan has generally been well received.  It recognises a number of the key issues where progress is needed in the short term and we anticipate that 97% of these actions will be completed by the end of 2021.  The subgroup will continue to meet on a regular basis to monitor the ongoing implementation of those actions due in 2021, and the small number that fall into 2022.<\/p><p> The action plan sets out 62 actions to bring down costs for consumers and businesses, introduce more competition into the market, prevent fraud and reduce the burden on businesses and community and voluntary organisations.  The action plan will replace the book of quantum with new guidelines on the appropriate level of personal injury awards.  It will enhance the role of PIAB.  It will examine the duty of care to strengthen waivers and notices in order to increase protection for consumers, businesses, sporting clubs and community groups.  It will further strengthen transparency through the expansion of the national claims information database and monitor whether personal injury awards need to be capped.  It will reduce insurance fraud, including by placing perjury on a statutory footing, making the offence easier to prosecute.  It will strengthen the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, examine dual pricing and establish an office within the Government to encourage greater insurance market competition.<\/p><p> I will provide an overview of the plan's principal aims.  First, members will be aware that the Judicial Council has been tasked with adopting new guidelines as to the appropriate level of court awards in personal injury actions.  The new guidelines must be adopted by the Judicial Council no later than 31 July 2021, which is three months earlier than had originally been planned.  While I do not have any influence on these guidelines, I believe that at the very least they will bring both certainty and clarity to the settlement of personal injury actions in the courts.  I further believe that since PIAB assessment levels will also be based on these new guidelines, there will be less incentive for claimants to reject a PIAB settlement and proceed to litigation.  The action plan seeks to examine the duty of care to strengthen waivers and notices to increase protection for consumers, businesses, sporting clubs and community groups.  The Department of Justice is reviewing the legislation in this respect and will bring its findings, including any recommendations, to the subgroup in the very near future.<\/p><p> It is also important to progress the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which it is hoped can be passed by the Oireachtas in early 2021.  For the first time, there will be a statutory offence of perjury which will make it a criminal offence.  It is expected to have a significant deterrent effect in regard to fraudulent insurance claims, particularly if these claims are being made attractive.  The Department of Justice is also increasing co-ordination and co-operation between the Garda and the industry, and examining the publication of insurance data fraud details.<\/p><p> The national claims information database reports have shown the clear benefits of PIAB to consumers.  It plays a critical role in the success of what we are trying to do.  We have seen its impact previously in regard to the cost of insurance and we hope it will have a similar impact again.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is considering the role and remit of PIAB and, in particular, how to increase the number of cases which are settled by PIAB without having to go through the recourse of litigation.  It is also worth noting the national claims information database report and that PIAB has commenced an advertising initiative recently to increase awareness of the clear benefits of using PIAB.<\/p><p> Encouraging competition in the insurance sector is another innovation in this action plan, and it is one that I believe can benefit the industry as much as it will benefit consumers going forward.  In this regard, I am pleased that an office has been established within the Department of Finance tasked with encouraging greater competition in the insurance sector.  I believe this can provide a far more joined-up approach between State bodies in the area and will adopt a strategic approach to reduce existing barriers to competition.  I chaired the first meeting of this office yesterday.  We will be holding regular meetings and reporting on the ongoing work of this office to the Cabinet subgroup.<\/p><p> Linked to this, the action plan contains a number of important actions to strengthen competition enforcement.  In this regard, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently preparing the draft general scheme of a competition (amendment) Bill.  The Bill will include the transposition of the relevant EU directive, which will represent a step change in competition enforcement in Ireland.  Included in the provisions are a new civil enforcement regime for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  This will include the power to levy significant administrative sanctions, arrange for statutory immunity and leniency and measures to enhance the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, on Monday the Central Bank published its interim report on differential pricing in the motor and home insurance sector.  I know this is an issue that is important to members of the committee and I believe it needs to be considered further.  That said, we need to recognise that the interim report notes the issue is complex, and there are winners and losers.  I believe, therefore, it is sensible to await the outcome of the Central Bank's full review before deciding what action is required with regard to dual pricing.  That report will be completed in the coming year.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I remind members of the commitment Insurance Ireland made to this committee that if award levels came down, so would the premiums charged by its members.  I believe this continues to be a very important statement, and it is a commitment the Government intends to hold the insurance industry to.  Yesterday, I met with Insurance Ireland and also with the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  As we begin to emerge from Covid-19 next year, I believe the industry will play a key role in helping to reopen the economy and wider society.  I believe that should costs fall for insurers, whether as a result of the reforms or through lower claims costs as a result of the pandemic, insurers need to reflect these savings to their customers.  I believe this is consistent with the previous statement by the industry that it should treat its customers honestly and fairly at all times.  In that regard, I am personally writing to the CEOs of the main insurers in the State within the next week to outline my views and to ask for a further commitment on how these reforms may reduce premiums.<\/p><p> I hope I have outlined a number of the key elements of our work.  I believe last week's launch demonstrates this is an issue the Government will prioritise.  Once implemented, the key reforms should begin to ease affordability and availability difficulties that consumers and businesses have been experiencing.  I would welcome the views of members and I am open to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#A00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The second half concerns information on profitability and costs.  The Central Bank of Ireland is the regulator and has complete access to all that information on a company-by-company basis.  Part of our work will involve greater liaison with the Central Bank from a governance point of view without interfering with its independence or regulatory role.  It has much data and information.  We saw this with the dual-pricing report issued last week.  The Central Bank has a mountain of information that can be of help to policymakers without requiring discussions between us and the Central Bank that cut across its independent regulatory role.  We will be able to get that information.<\/p> <p>  I have stated in the action plan that we want a breakdown of all the costs associated with what makes up an insurance premium.  For example, it goes without saying that claims are the main element.  Legal fees and company overheads are significant, as are the companies' profit margins.  The reinsurance moneys paid are interesting because, of the top eight or nine insurance companies I met, which represent more than 90% of the insurance market in Ireland, only one is locally owned.  One can take it that practically all the insurance policies being written in Ireland for cars, houses and businesses are being written by foreign multinationals selling into the Irish market.  That means two things.  While the companies are big employers, employing 28,000 in the sector, they are mobile.  The main message I got from them in meetings was that up to now, Ireland has been a volatile market.  There have been ups and downs, and profits and losses can vary depending on what happens.  As a result of what has happened in the industry in recent years, every policyholder in Ireland has been lumped with 5% as part of his or her premium to cover stamp duty and levies, primarily as a result of what happened more recently with Quinn Insurance.  Prior to that, we had the PMPA.  If we go back far enough, we had the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  A point that might never have been made publicly before is that Ireland has a bad history when it comes to its own insurance companies.  There is only one of any substance today, FBD.  Every other insurance policy provider in Ireland is not an Irish company.  That is a major issue and it has added to the volatility of the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  It also leads to a second issue, which is related to getting further information on costs of the insurance companies.  In one-to-one discussions with me, the representatives of some of the companies were relatively open, or as open as they could be given that they could be quoted on stock markets.  There is a certain amount of information they cannot disclose.  Some of the individual companies were much less open because they were not in a position to breach arrangements with their organisation's head office.  I queried every one of the companies on the cost of reinsurance, which tends to be about 10%, based on the information I picked up.  Some of the companies say they are in the market for reinsurance and that they can show me how they get it.  I asked how they fix what they pay for reinsurance.  One said that the head office in Zurich just states what the figure is.  These are the issues I am now dealing with, especially when the companies are not home-grown.  I want to make sure that the payments to the head office do not include an element of profit on top of the normal dividends.<\/p> <p>  The last two costs I want to concentrate on are the costs of fraud and exaggerated cases, which have been difficult to prosecute in the past.  Notably, I met representatives of the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland last week and they told me that, on the day, there were 165,000 uninsured drivers on the Irish roads.  That is 7% of all cars here.  They are uninsured or those driving are not insured to drive them.  The cost has to be met by the people who are paying for policies.  That is why there is a levy to cover some of the costs of the Motor of Insurance Bureau of Ireland.  There are significant elements making up the cost a driver's premium, which may be &euro;500.  Claims are a major issue.  That is what we are delving into now.  I have given the Deputy a flavour of the work we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#C00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Has the Minister of State any proposals to put more pressure on claimants or encourage them to accept awards from PIAB as opposed to going to PIAB and straight to court afterwards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#C00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I have met representatives of the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland on that issue.  Their view is that their members are brought in only if a client comes to them.  They say their members are not out looking for business.  That is a moot point but what we are doing, as part of a key element, is engaging in PIAB reform.  Under the action plan, there is to be public consultation in the first quarter of next year.  By June 2021, we will have legislative proposals to reform PIAB.  We want it to be the case that when people bring cases to PIAB, they should know that it is the end of the road, by and large, and that by going to court, they will not get any more.<\/p> <p>  This brings me directly to the book of quantum.  Some people believe that if they go to court, they might get a bigger award.  They might get an extra 5% but it is minimal because there are substantial legal costs when going to court.  Therefore, the book of quantum is the issue.  It has been set by PIAB but people feel that if they go to court, they might get more.  What is happening now, which is already well under way owing to previous legislation, is that the book of quantum is going to be set by the Judicial Council.  The last Government had legislation in place.  The council was to report by the end of October next year.  When the council sets the book of quantum, everyone will know it is fixed because it will have been set by the judges.  The judges are not going to set it and have it changed when people go to court after going to PIAB.

Many people, however, may feel that there has been much talk about insurance in recent years but not the necessary level of action.  They might also think that there is an element of horizon politics at work, because these initiatives are still on the horizon and in the future.  If we look at many sectors of the economy, the structure of the market itself has enormous influence on how those sectors function, whether that is in housing, banking, the beef industry or insurance.  Those are dysfunctional markets, to a certain extent, in that a small number of players exert enormous influence.  Six car insurers have 80% of the market, while eight insurers have about 90% of the market in house insurance.  Even if we do not bring in the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the structure of that market is not one which a Government should be looking to create.  We should be seeking to create a far more diverse market so that there is more competition and there are more opportunities for people.  What is going to be done to increase the number of players within the market?<\/p> <p>  There has also been an EU investigation into the insurance market here, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has carried out an investigation.  What plans are there to strengthen the ability of that agency to ensure there is functional competition?  Another issue is that there are no caps on claims.  I understand the absence of a cap in a catastrophic accident case scenario, because that kind of situation would necessitate some judicial understanding of the needs of individuals before making a decision.  For 80% of cases, however, those which are run of the mill, such as soft tissue type of accidents, we should be introducing a cap.  Why has that not happened?  In February, Deputy Michael McGrath, who is now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, said he would be bringing in caps.  Why has that not been brought into place in this plan?  Perhaps the Minister of State could address those three questions first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#D00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>That is fine.  The first aspect concerns getting more players and competition into the market so that we will not be just relying on eight or ten insurance companies.  That is exactly the reason the new office was established.  It was created to promote competition and it held its first meeting yesterday.  We saw that one of the key problems was exactly as the Deputy described it.  The structure of the market is very small and dependent on companies from outside the State.  That is our number one objective.<\/p> <p>  I chaired the first meeting of that committee yesterday, and that is an aspect on which I would be happy to come back to the committee and report on.  It has been set up specifically in respect of the purpose mentioned by the Deputy.  If we achieve much of what is in the action plan, that in itself will help.  Bringing a bit of stability to the market will be the best way of attracting new businesses into Ireland.  If companies feel that the market here is one where it is not possible for them to predict awards and costs, then that is going to put companies off coming here.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the second issue, I have also noticed in my meetings with the companies that some of them have scaled back their activities.  The representatives from those companies told us that they had been big in the leisure and hospitality areas, but there were so many trips and falls and people crossing the thresholds of businesses that they had been scaling back their activities.  Others, however, have increased their activity in the market.  Some car insurance companies told us that they have scaled back on providing insurance for those aged under 25 years old, while another company has heavily stepped into that same market.  We can, therefore, increase competition in the various insurance sectors by getting all eight or nine companies already there to compete in all the segments in the sector.  The purpose of this new office is to promote competition in the Irish market, by bringing in new businesses and getting those currently in the field to do more business.  Those companies, however, will want a stable market in respect of the cost of claims.  Regarding the EU agency issue mentioned by the Deputy, I do not have the answer in front of me now.  We will send a note on that issue to the committee, if that is okay.  I might get a note on it now, but I will give a comprehensive answer in writing in any event.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the cap on claims, that is something which many people before the previous election, including us, said would be considered.  We said it would be \"considered\".  That was the word used, because nobody could make a blanket statement that we would guarantee to do something.  That is because there may be constitutional implications, especially for the very catastrophic cases.  A young child involved in a car accident could live for 60 or 70 years.  Who can know that?  The Law Reform Commission recently published a report on that specific issue.  That report is independent of all of us and we will be guided by it.  It is stated in that report that we could pass legislation to set awards at a particular level based on the level of injuries, provided that a judge stepping outside those awards in exceptional cases had to state the exact reasons for doing so.<\/p> <p>  The idea of having an absolute cap could require a constitutional amendment.  Some people will say that would be great, and it would allow certainty in 99% of cases and flexibility in 1% of those cases where judges require it.  Other people might suggest that once some people get their foot in the door with the 1% flexibility, there will then be expansion.  We are therefore being guided by the report of the Law Reform Commission.  Having the Judicial Council set the book of quantum will ensure that it will be written by the judges, and the people will know that.  When claimants go to the PIAB seeking awards, they will know that it is not an award which the PIAB made up but an award which the Judicial Council has given to the PIAB to implement according to the book of quantum document.  There will be little incentive to take that award before the judges who have already written that book of quantum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#D00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>If there is flexibility for judges on payouts, then there may still be an incentive because an individual judge could still deviate from the book of quantum.

Setting awards in catastrophic injury cases is a difficult issue to resolve.  We cannot have caps for 99% of the cases and then an exception for the other 1%.

The reason those companies probably do not challenge enough is that, in general, they feel that the courts are on the side of the claimant rather than a foreign multinational insurance company.  That is the perception of the insurance companies regarding how they think cases will be looked at in the courts.

They were so cheap as to prevent the companies issuing them from being viable.  Quinn Insurance is the most recent example of a company that went under because it did not have the necessary reserves.  As a result of that, we are all paying the extra levies I mentioned.  There is a 2% levy and a 3% stamp duty in place to cover the costs arising.  One of these levies raises approximately &euro;40 million per annum and comprises a percentage of every insurance premium.  The legislation requires that a fund of &euro;200 million be built up, which will then be held in reserve on the State's behalf and can be used if another insurance company goes bust so as to avoid having to introduce a new levy every time an insurance company goes bust.  It will take a couple of years to build up that fund.  As we speak, every policyholder in Ireland is paying for the cheap policies that were available earlier because the reserves were not there when needed.  We have now had to introduce levies to build up a fund to prevent that happening again.<\/p> <p>  On cash flow, I do not have a clear answer but I will come back to the Deputy on the issue.  Generally, these companies invest in Government bonds because they are looking for stability.  They obviously have to hold a significant amount in reserve because the industry is regulated.  They must always maintain some cash to meet current claims.  I will seek further information on that issue as part of my ongoing work in my role in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#E00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It has been the most keen on helping young drivers under 25 years of age.  It concentrates on that market, which is good.   I hope it continues in that way.  The cost of insurance for young drivers is a big issue but that cost has been coming down.  I have met representatives of many youth organisations and they have said that, while it remains a big issue, the costs have been coming down.  The first year of insurance can be very dear but many young people have said that, by the second or third year, the cost comes down.  I hope this company, which is strong in that market, continues to do as it is doing but I also want more competition.

I am glad the Minister of State mentioned that because I am concerned that, no matter what level of insurance cover is provided, if the entity providing that cover decides to invest foolishly in high-return investment proposals, it will eventually undermine the solvency of the company offering the cover, which will create a problem for insured members of the general public.<\/p> <p>  The question of capping has already been mentioned.  Like everybody else, I have looked at this again and again.  I am not so sure of its merits.  As far as I am concerned, the jury is still out.  One has no way of assessing the extent of an injury in a particular situation and how it might develop in the future.  A classic example is a child receiving serious, life-altering injuries at the age of ten or 12.  Such a child may receive an award that seems to be consistent with the degree of the disability arising and the need to provide a reasonable quality of follow-up services to that person but, unfortunately, with the passage of time even a high award will diminish and may be insufficient to meet modern-day demands.  I and, I am sure, everybody else have seen cases in which large awards were given to children who had become wards of court.  In these cases, the awards came to be less significant over time and it became very difficult to eke out sufficient funds to cater for these people, who were now adults of 45, 50 or 60 years of age.  I would like such people to be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  I have two or three last questions.  I know many motor insurance claims are said to be exaggerated and that there are questions around whiplash and so on.  We have looked at these issues but, at the time and the site of an accident, it is not always possible to have all information made available.  The person directly involved may not be in a position to give such information and his or her recollection of the accident may be flawed due to shock or other factors.  I believe we have a responsibility to look after the people who are injured in such situations and that we should try to ensure that they are not disadvantaged because, it is to be hoped, they have a life to live afterwards.<\/p> <p>  My next point relates to when an insurance company informs the insured that he or she is liable and must accept responsibility.  This is classic stuff.  That is an arbitrary decision on which people should be very slow to come to a conclusion.  Again, the person involved in the accident, whether that accident was little or large, may not be in the best position to judge whether he or she was liable.  I know that, like myself, everybody here has dealt with cases in which people asked why they were liable only to be told it was because the injured party was crossing the road at the time of the accident.  There is a failure to mention that the insured party was stopped at the time and that a vehicle coming in the other direction ploughed into them.  The owners of this vehicle manage to walk off with no liability whatsoever whereas the person who followed due process, who stopped when an accident was about to occur, is held liable.  That also needs to be borne in mind.  The advice of the insured person's insurance company may sometimes be wrong, leading to a liability on the part of the insured which should not arise.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be glad to know I only have two last points.  The first is on health insurance and, in particular, death benefit.  Every one of us could paper the walls with correspondence on the cases we have had to deal with regarding people who were not really covered at all when one read the small print.  In these cases, if the insured people had read the small print more carefully, they would have realised they were not covered.  There are other cases in which people were found to have already been suffering from an illness which could then have related to their later demise.  As a result, it is argued that no liability arises as far as the insurance company is concerned even though medical evidence was made available in such cases demonstrating that the person died from a totally different illness or complaint.  The theory seems to be that the existing illness might have led to the later complaint and that the insurance company cannot be sure.<\/p><p>We do not know about that and we will never know.  <\/p><p> The last thing I want to talk about concerns drivers who were not born in this jurisdiction, although they may be Irish citizens, and who are involved in a road traffic accident.  Sometimes they may not have the best English to explain themselves.  Not so long ago I dealt with a case where the person was summoned to court, fined and deemed to be liable for the accident.  I am not a lawyer, and I apologise to all the lawyers present and the police outside, but when I examined the case, there was no way the driver was liable as he had observed the rules.  The insurance company said he was liable beyond all doubt.  However, the person took the case to court and won.  We went back to the insurance company stating that it had been clearly demonstrated that the insured person was not liable and asking it whether it was in a position to resolve the matter.  Reluctantly, after an awful lot of hand-wringing, the result was accepted.  That is the kind of everyday thing that we, as representatives, have to deal with.  I am sure the Minister of State has had to deal with such cases as well.  A balance must be struck between the outrageously high awards and a need to ensure the general public is protected and that the State does not have to come in help the people who should have been sufficiently provided for in the first instance by the insurers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#E00500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I take the comments on board.

It has stated that home insurance will go up by 35% and motor insurance by 25%.  These companies, which have a legal responsibility under the consumer protection code to act fairly, honestly and with integrity with their consumers, have basically lied to the Government and their consumers, as well as having false documents on their website, because they are hiding the fact that dual pricing is an issue.  I made a major complaint, as well as a submission of 130 pages, to the Central Bank on dual pricing over a year ago.  Page 12 outlined exactly what the Central Bank found, which is that the longer one is with an insurance company, the more one will be fleeced by it.  The graph is the same as that in this report.<\/p> <p>  What is the Minister of State going to do now that the insurance companies have lied to the Government and to their consumers in not acknowledging that dual pricing, price-walking or price optimisation - whatever one wants to call it - is a factor in premiums being pushed up?  What is he going to do about the fact that they have breached the consumer protection code?  Is he going to challenge them?<\/p> <p>  In 2015, the then Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, wrote to the then Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, stating that representatives of regulated entities, insurance companies, were providing deliberately false information to the Central Bank but it had no remedy to deal with this issue because there was a lacuna in the legislation.  I have challenged Governments upside down, inside out and produced legislation to close that gap.

Then we are trying to battle against all the false narratives.  For example, one of the final sections of the Central Bank report refers to false narratives such as costs of claims increases and fraud.  While there are issues in that regard which have to be dealt with, none of this is the reason insurance premiums have been increasing.  One of the main reasons is actually price-walking or dual pricing which is about boosting the profits of the industry.  The Minister of State should not take the industry at its word.  He needs to challenge everything it says.  It is unfortunate that one of the first things the Minister of State did was suggest that recommendation No. 1 was implemented when, clearly, it was not.

Page 12 in my report looks at what the Central Bank has done.  They nearly coalesce.  It is in the same ballpark.  After nine years or more the premiums charged are 30% higher.  After the first year and into the second and third years, it is approximately 10% higher.  We talk of this as the loyalty premium.<\/p><p> I have asked for dual pricing to be banned for more than a year.  I asked the Central Bank to carry out an investigation, which it agreed to do, on receipt of my report.  The Central Bank has confirmed everything in my initial claim.  In Trump's America, dual pricing is banned in 20 states.  In Britain, it will probably be banned in the second quarter of next year.  In fact, it is not probably; they are going to ban it.  The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in the UK has made it clear that it will ban dual pricing.  Yet, the Government here is not willing to make a policy decision that this practice will end.  Let us be clear about what this means.  The Central Bank's report conclusions are, as we can extrapolate, that some 2.5 million policy holders in the State were charged annually &euro;187 million more than it costs to insure those policies.  In Britain, where they have done far more research on this, they estimate that the banning of dual pricing would benefit the consumers there by between &euro;4 billion and &euro;12 billion.  The FCA says that average prices would decrease by between 10% and 15% for consumers and that it would encourage competition in the market.  Why is the Government delaying on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#G02000","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>As I said, the staff of new office to promote competition in the insurance market only met yesterday for the first time.

The Central Bank should not have had to be told by a Member of the Oireachtas to carry out this work.  It is way behind the curve on this matter.  These insurance companies have been practicing dual pricing for ages.  What we know from the Central Bank's work is that this is happening and that people are being price gouged the longer they stay with an insurance company.  It is not just about not renewing a policy; these insurance companies gather information on their consumers.  They gather data through legal means, which the customer gives in the renewal policy or when taking out a new policy.  The companies can also gather the information by purchasing third party information about our shopping and other habits, and they can gather information from social media posts and videos that people put up.  This information is gathered for one purpose: how can they increase prices before we decide to move to a competitor.  It should be banned.  The Government should make a statement of intent that this practice will end and that it is going to protect consumers.  In the middle of next year, for example, Aviva will not be able to price gouge their customers, motorists and homeowners in Belfast, Newry or Derry.  Aviva here, however, will still be able to engage in dual pricing.

When a person gets a renewal notice and automatically sends back the cheque the insurance company knows that this person never contests the costs of their policy and the person is deemed a soft touch.  If a person rings the insurance company and says \"I want to check the price\" and then rings back a fortnight later, because he or she must be issued with the renewal premium notice one month in advance, they will be able to tell the customer that he or she rang three weeks ago at such a time.

I wish him well in his role and I know that he is committed to it.  More than 25 years ago, a gentleman walked into my premises and fell and broke his hip.  He was an English gentleman and claimed through the English system, to the relief of the Irish insurance company, because the claim was capped.  That was 25 years ago and we have much to catch up on with regard to claims.  A key issue in Ireland is that one does not know what the payout will be.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the whole-of-government approach to the insurance industry.  I know it spreads across a number of Departments and is quite complex.  Equally, I hope that the Government will look at individual sections, because much can be done that does not necessarily require other Departments to be involved.  Most people have spoken about high-level matters.  I want to focus on the clients, the role of clients and their interaction with insurance companies.  Having run my own business for more than 30 years, I have had numerous engagements with insurance companies, some of which have been positive, while others have been negative.  As the Minister of State mentioned, transparency about what one is entitled to know as a client and the information one is given has been an issue.  I went to court on one occasion to give my evidence and the claim was settled while we were at lunch.  I am still waiting to find out what exactly was settled and how exactly the settlement was reached.<\/p> <p>  Companies are being held to ransom more and more because there is not competition in the insurance industry.  We are getting more fearful about what we can or cannot do.  Another example of a practical experience is a claim a number of years ago, which we were not aware of until it arrived in the post from a solicitor.  We rang the insurance company to say there was a potential claim.  The insurance company said it was not notified of that claim when it occurred and I said that I was not notified of it either.  The company said that I must notify it if there was a potential claim.  Now when one is looking at renewing insurance, one looks at the number of potential claims that are on one's books that may never turn into a claim, yet one is penalised because of them.  One then has a number of actual claims on one's books.  Some might be genuine while many are fraudulent.  They can hang in a system for six to eight years before they are settled.  During that process, one has to pay a premium because the claim sits on one's books, unresolved.  I would like to see much more focus on transparency and reform.<\/p> <p>  I feel that as a client, I am not treated fairly or getting enough information to allow me to understand why the premiums that I am presented with are coming.  Having had a 15 year clear record, my insurance jumped by 300% in two years, and almost made the company unviable.  Even my  own brother, who is a chartered accountant, looked at the option of providing our own insurance, because we could not pay the premium we were being asked for.  That happened because we had three claims after 15 years without any.  The three claims, which are now four years old, still have not progressed anywhere and no settlement has been made on any of them, but we pay a premium on that year after year.  There is no clawback on that.  The insurance company will not say that because the claim was never settled and nothing was paid out on it, one will get the premiums paid for the last four years back.  I would like to see more work on transparency and what we are entitled to as clients with regard to the operation of the insurance industry.<\/p> <p>  Under GDPR, we are not allowed to hold our video evidence for longer than a month.  It is a simple, practical thing.  One thing that worked in our favour was that when we were told of a potential claim, we had CCTV on file.  Unless that claim comes within a month, that CCTV information has to be wiped.  If somebody makes a claim in six months, I have no evidence.  I have nothing to back me up, as a client, to try to mitigate that claim.  I find it frustrating that when I hold my hands up and say that a genuine accident took place and think I was liable, the person on the other side will be put through the same process even though we are holding our hands up.  The fraudulent ones drag things out and every year that they drag it out is another year with excess on my premium.  The Minister of State mentioned the level of competition.  There is no competition for the hospitality sector at the moment and one is held to ransom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#J00200","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I have listened carefully to the Senator.  I am here to give an update and to hear the committee's views.  Members have made clear that we all have a common interest in this.  The Senator is clear that if one notifies an insurance company of a potential claim, it marks it on the book as a potential claim and makes a provision for it, stating that it might cost &euro;6,000 whenever it comes to settled.  It is marked against the policyholder and the company makes provision for it.  If that potential claim never materialises into an actual claim, is there a write-back or clawback for the extra increase?  I am conscious of that and will take it up with the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland.  It would seem fair if a company makes a provision on the basis of something happening.  Banks do it all the time, making a provision for loans in financial statements.  If it reassesses the provision a year later and finds that it was too generous, it will write it back and it will go back into the system.  The same should happen here, with insurance companies writing back provisions they make and passing it on to the customer.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the situation with regard to video evidence.  I do not know the answer to that but we will look at it.  Businesses can be defenceless if somebody waits for a significant period before making a claim, at which time there will be no video evidence in place to prove otherwise.  While that legislation has good points, it has downsides related to these issues.  While I am sure other people will have a different view, if the law provides a certain period in which a person can make a claim, logic would say that the person against whom the claim has been made should have an equal right to be able to defend himself or herself for the same period by having CCTV available.  I am not giving that commitment but I am saying that logic suggests that it should be looked at.  It is an issue that we will have to take up with the Data Protection Commissioner, the Department of Justice and many people in wider society.  It is not fair that one side of litigation can be disadvantaged by not having access to information that it had but was required to destroy, or is not allowed to use in a case to defend itself.

The Senator might note my earlier comment that this is the problem with insurance in Ireland.  We have only one Irish insurance company.  I am sure more than 80% of all insurance policies written in Ireland are written by foreign companies.  As I said, I have met the eight largest insurance companies operating in Ireland.  Only one, FBD, is Irish owned.  The rest of them are foreign multinationals.  The issue the Senator highlighted of a person having to get cover from a foreign insurance company is what happens in the case of 85% of all insurance policies in Ireland.  That is an issue with which we need to deal.<\/p> <p>  I highlighted that the history of Irish insurance companies has not been good.  All we need do is note what happened with Quinn Insurance.

We are picking up the cost of that, and prior to that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland also went bust.  Three major Irish insurance companies have gone bust.  That is not a good track record for any country to have.  We have only one Irish insurance company left.  We are relying on foreign multinational insurance companies to provide insurance cover for almost everything in Ireland.  I want increased competition in that area to increase what is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#K00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I heard the Minister of State say this issue has been satisfactorily dealt with in terms of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#K00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#K00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I am dealing with a company involved in adventure services that cannot source insurance here.

I was at a meeting immediately before I came here with a group who are working with a small group of people who are trying to get insurance for a bouncy castle type of industry group.  The insurance company that was providing the cover was a UK company and was governed by UK standards with respect to the annual testing of the equipment.  Those standards did not apply in Ireland.  People thought they had insurance cover only to find their claim was not accepted, and when somebody checked the small print for them, they found their claim did not apply.  Such a company would not have cover if it made a claim because it would not meet the UK standards of inspection.  Clear issues arise.<\/p> <p>  That group raised with me exactly the point the Senator has made, namely, to see if something could be done across the sector.  Some of those involved are voluntary and community groups as well as some very small businesses that might have one employee or be a self-employed person.  The issue of the community groups was raised.  I asked about the Tidy Towns groups and where they get their insurance.  The 500 or 600 Tidy Town groups around the country generally make their own individual arrangements.  If there is a federation operating at a county level for Tidy Town federations or community groups through the public participation networks, PPNs, in the local authorities, I would see a great opportunity for somebody to work on a collective basis bringing groups together engaged in similar activities to get a group insurance policy in place.

One can drive down the road and get fuel in one filling station at one price but at a different price in another filling station a mile down the road.  A level of competition between companies in a given area of activity on the same product is valid and helpful.  It gives consumers choice if they shop around.  Having said that, not everybody goes to the filling station that sells the cheapest fuel.  If that was the case, none of the more expensive ones would do business.  People make choices on a number of bases, one of which is the price of the insurance.  In some instances, people might be happy with the personnel they have dealt with in the company or the service they have received.  It may be the case that they had claims years ago which were looked at satisfactorily.  Quality of service comes into it as well; it is not just a matter of the price of the product.  Price is a major element in people's decisions but the quality of the product is also important, as is the small print because there can be several exclusions.<\/p><p> When looking at the issue of dual pricing and at introducing legislation to deal with it, we must ensure everything is on an equal footing because we do not want people to lose out financially.

He can.  I will talk about motor insurance.  I am reminded of the words of the late great Woody Guthrie who said that, as he travelled through life, he met many kinds of men; some would rob him would rob him with a six-gun and others with a fountain pen.  I certainly think that is applicable to the insurance industry in this country.  The area of motor insurance really underlines that point.  I put it to the Minister of State that the issue here is, first and foremost and overwhelmingly, one of plain old-fashioned profiteering.  Even a cursory look at the facts underlines that this is the case.<\/p> <p>  I will not try to blind the committee with science or with an avalanche of facts and figures, but let us have a look at a few.  Between 2009 and 2019, the volume of claims decreased substantially, by 45%.  The cost of claims was also down 9%.  One would expect that, in those circumstances, premiums would have fallen but not only have they not fallen, they increased by 35% between 2009 and 2019.  It is little wonder that profits of &euro;142 million were raked in by the motor insurance sector.  This was once again an increase on the previous year, and not by a small amount but by 9%.  That is quite a hike in this space over only 12 months.  How does this compare to other jurisdictions?  Many of the big insurance corporations that operate in this State also operate in the UK.  Do they get more bang for their buck in the UK or in the Republic of Ireland?  There is no comparison.  They make nearly double the profits per unit of investment here that they do in the UK.  <\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, a stop must be put to this profiteering.  There is only question really worth considering.  What is the best and most effective way to put a halt to profiteering and to provide an efficient service of good quality for the population?  That is only real issue here.  From many of the contributions to this discussion, and certainly from those of the Minister of State, it seems to be taken as a given that it is all about competition.  Motor insurance could actually be organised in such a way that there would be zero competition while providing a far better and cheaper reliable service for ordinary people.  It happens in other jurisdictions.  In some other jurisdictions, the cost of motor insurance claims for a given year is calculated and a little bit more is added to allow for rollover of certain investments.  The number of motorists using petrol and diesel respectively is calculated.  An additional charge is then levied on petrol and diesel which then builds up the fund to pay the costs of motor insurance payouts.  That has been done in the past in New Zealand and in various provinces of Canada.<\/p><p>It is not a particularly complex scheme to work out.  That would be one way of doing it.<\/p><p> I would favour focus on and debate around the idea that the people have been bled dry for years by the motor insurance rip-off.  Let us look at the idea of public ownership and nationalisation.  Does that mean compensation for shareholders?  Yes it does if it is a pension fund or an ordinary person who has invested a few bob in shares, but for millionaire and billionaire shareholders, then no, it does not.  Then the resources available to society are used for the common good and providing a decent service but eliminating the profit motive from it.  I am open to a discussion and debate around those points but it should be on the basis of how we get to the root of the issue here, and the root of the issue is profiteering.  The debate has to be around the best way to eliminate profiteering from the insurance industry.  Does the Minister of State accept the proposition that the fundamental problem here is profiteering?  If he does not accept that, I want to hear an argument against it because it seems that the facts speak very clearly to it and the majority of ordinary people who have experienced the insurance racket and the motor insurance rip-off would be interested in hearing the argument against that because I think they are convinced that is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#L01000","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We are caught for time again, so I will also put some questions before the Minister of State answers.  To give an example, Irish Life issues a premium to one of its clients for life assurance of &euro;1,049.  This year, it went up by &euro;360 per month, a colossal increase.  There is no justification for it.  The policy is for elderly people and so they are finding it really difficult to grapple with a huge company like that and get some form of justice.  Charlie Weston's article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>which quotes from the Central Bank, is headlined &quot;Elderly hit hardest&quot;.  It is the elderly and vulnerable who find it most difficult to move around and change insurance companies to test the cost of premium against another company.  They are really suffering badly.  Out of respect for those who are marginalised or elderly, we should do something specific about their cases now to assist them in the context of the rip-off that is taking place and the fact that their vulnerability is what is playing against them.  It is shocking in the extreme that a big insurance company that is profiteering, gouging and into price fixing, to a degree, will target the elderly in the way it does and make it impossible for them to exercise their right to change insurance companies.  I ask the Minister of State to address that specifically or give me information on how a Member of the House can address it directly to the company because it is an outrage.<\/p><p>Second, for the last term in Government, I listened patiently here to the arguments around the insurance companies and what they were doing and the rather big talk about reform and very little action.  The T&aacute;naiste, in particular, in the foreword by him to this document, has a brass neck to make the comments he has made.  One would be led to believe that he had just been elected to the D&aacute;il and that he had no input on this in the previous Government when he did.  This committee listened to many contributions giving us the impression that we are actually moving to a point where the insurance companies were going to be stopped in their tracks in how they treated their customers and that did not happen.  Now we are embarking on a new Government, of which the Minister of State is part, and I will be looking for actions, not reports.  In this foreword the T&aacute;naiste says, &quot;It is my firm intention to have updates on these timelines on a quarterly basis.&quot;  He is making a mockery of what is going on here and he needs to be challenged on it in the Department of Finance because all we have had for the past four years has been this type of play on words and play on presentation to give the impression that actually we are doing something positive and people will feel a reduction in their premiums.  I know from my premium and those of business that they have all gone up and not gone down.  I would say the same, and the Minister of State is photographed beside him, to Paschal Donohoe.<\/p><p>The content of that foreword must disgust people because of what they know is happening in the insurance industry.  I ask for clear action across the board to bring down the cost of insurance.  Insurance Ireland made presentations here, as did others.  The one thing that came across in every presentation that was made - there was one side against the other, the insurance companies on one side, and the customers on the other - was that the insurance companies and their umbrella organisation were simply not making the information available about what is happening in Ireland in terms of insurance.  Therefore an outside player comes in blind rather than being fully informed.  That, in short, is the problem.  We will certainly have engagements with the Minister of State over the duration of the Government, but on reflection, our engagement with the previous Administration and Minister was hopeless.  I would like to be able to say differently but that is not the case.  The Minister of State says the subcommittee is dealing with this.

It is a little longer than five minutes but not too much longer.  I will try to shorten it as much as I can to make it more accessible for the members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Government established the High-Level Task Force on Covid-19 Vaccination on 10 November 2020 to ensure that the right oversight and specialist input is available to support the HSE and the Department of Health in the effective, efficient and agile delivery of the Covid-19 vaccination programme.  I was appointed chair of the task force, which has met three times to date.  A fourth meeting is scheduled for this afternoon. <\/p> <p>  The agreed terms of reference are: to support the Department of Health and Health Service Executive to deliver a Covid-19 immunisation programme, that meets best practice and provides good governance, as a critical public health intervention in the prevention and control of Covid-19; working with the Department of Health and the HSE, to develop a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan for the safe, effective and efficient procurement, distribution, delivery and recording of Covid-19 vaccines when approved vaccines are ready to be distributed; to provide a focal point for engagements with sectoral and specialist expertise as may be needed to support the development, implementation and agile iteration of both the strategy and the plan; and to monitor progress and report to Government, as may be required, on the development and implementation of the strategy and plan. <\/p> <p>  When the task force was established, there was already significant work on a vaccination programme ongoing across both the HSE and the Department of Health, and implementation of the strategy will rely in the normal way on the governance structures and statutory responsibilities of a range of existing bodies.  Given the range of responsibilities and actors, and the level of responsiveness that will be required as the programme rolls out, there will be a need to augment and support existing arrangements.  It is useful in that context to be clear about the role of the task force in the context of those existing roles and responsibilities. <\/p> <p>  In respect of immunisation programmes and policies, the role of the Department of Health includes making policy decisions based on advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, these are then implemented by the HSE through the National Immunisation Office, NIO.  In the context of this vaccination programme, the Department of Health has responsibility for overall public health policy, legislative and regulatory arrangements, and EU co-operation arrangements, and it is also leading on communications for the programme.  The HSE has ultimate responsibility for the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccination programme through its NIO, which designs and implements all vaccination programmes in Ireland.  The role of the NIO in the vaccination programme includes vaccine procurement and distribution; immunisation training; certain communications to the public; and logistical considerations for vaccine storage, and distribution and return where appropriate.  The HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, is responsible for compiling and publishing data in respect of uptake and coverage of Covid-19 vaccines, liaising closely with the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC. <\/p> <p>  Where medicines are licensed centrally for all EU member states, as in this case, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, works closely with the European Medicines Agency, EMA, including participating in the EMA assessment process and post-marketing benefit-risk monitoring. The HPRA operates the national safety monitoring and risk management system and oversees quality defect reports on vaccines and other medicines. It also licences the facilities that carry out related manufacturing and distribution. <\/p> <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET oversees and provides national direction, guidance, support and expert advice on the development and implementation of a strategy to contain Covid-19 in Ireland.<\/p><p>It advises the Government on the public health aspects of the cross-Government response to Covid-19, including on the vaccination programme and, in particular, prioritisation in the context of pandemic management.<\/p><p> Both the HPSC and the Department of Health work closely with the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, and the Department is represented on the Health Security Committee, HSC, of the European Commission, which co-ordinates the EU response to infectious disease threats.  These will continue to provide advice on the vaccination programme and its impact in terms of pandemic management, the sequencing of the roll-out of the vaccine and the response to any emerging issues.<\/p><p> The challenge in devising and implementing a vaccination programme of this scale, complexity and desire for speed is unparalleled here and around the world.  Successful roll-out of the vaccination programme is dependent upon careful and precise co-ordination across Government, several State agencies, the HSE and a wide range of advisory, regulatory and delivery partners across the health sector and private sector providers.<\/p><p> The high-level task force I chair is ensuring that all of this ongoing work is co-ordinated within a single integrated work programme and supporting the Department of Health and the HSE to deliver a Covid-19 vaccination programme that meets best practice and good governance and it will play an ongoing role in the oversight and monitoring of programme implementation, harnessing the wide range of high-level expertise and experience of task force members.  The task force includes senior representatives from across the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the HPRA, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of Government Procurement, IDA Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Taoiseach.  It includes expertise in the areas of public health, supply chain logistics, cold chain logistics, and programme management.<\/p><p> A programme office has been established to support the high-level task force in its ongoing oversight and support role.  An integrated work programme, comprising seven work streams, has been established by the high-level task force, HLTF, which fully integrates the work that is ongoing across the Department of Health and the HSE.  The programme is using a structured programme and project management approach to manage and deliver all the core elements.  I will not list all of the work streams but I am happy to talk about them at any stage, as they affect all the core elements of the end-to-end vaccination process.<\/p><p> Each work stream is led by a senior responsible officer, SRO, and is supported by programme and project professionals as well as subject matter experts.  The SROs, the programme director and a number of subject matter experts form a programme working group, which has been established to co-ordinate, integrate and to report progress on work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#A01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I must stop Professor MacCraith.

I am here today in my capacity as chair of that committee.  It is less than one year since any one of us first heard of Covid.  Since then, globally, more than 72 million people have been infected and just over 1.6 million have died.  In Ireland, there have been more than 76,000 cases and 2,000 deaths.  Spurred by the urgency of the problem, it has taken scientists less than one year to develop effective vaccines.  We are now preparing for the roll-out of potentially three, but likely six, different Covid vaccines over the coming year.<\/p> <p>  Even just two to three years ago, the speed at which this has happened was inconceivable.  However, although rapid, it has not been rushed or reckless.  Rather, the speed is a reflection of the extraordinary advancements in the vaccination field that were under way before Covid19, harnessed together with unprecedented scientific co-operation and financial and human resource investment.  In the case of Covid, there was already much vaccine research that could be built on to facilitate rapid development of the vaccines and compress usual timelines.  Covid19 vaccine development was a single common global priority.  Large-scale investment both in human resource and finance enabled many steps to be undertaken in parallel and with much greater efficiency.  As Covid19 was, unfortunately, all too common and people were eager to help in finding a solution, recruitment to clinical trials was rapid.  Similarly, as symptomatic Covid19 and severe Covid disease were also very common, clinical trial endpoints, that is, reaching the point in a trial where one is able to tell if there was a difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, were quickly reached.<\/p> <p>  Vaccine safety is an overriding concern.  With vaccination, a higher safety bar is required than for most other medical interventions, as vaccines are administered to healthy individuals or those with stable underlying medical conditions.  Most adverse events following immunisation have onset within six weeks of vaccination.  Thus, a minimum median follow up of two months was required prior to evaluation of the clinical trial data by the regulatory agencies.  As with all newly licensed vaccines, it is possible that some rare or very rare, less than 1:10,000, adverse events following immunisation, AEFI, particularly those unique to specific populations, may not be known when the Covid19 vaccines are authorised.  Thus, it is critically important that, as planned, continued surveillance in the post-marketing phase is undertaken when vaccines will be administered not to tens of thousands but millions of individuals.<\/p> <p>  The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is likely to be the first Covid19 vaccine administered in Ireland.  Data from the randomised phase 3 trial based on more than 36,000 participants demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 95% in those aged 16 and over.  There were nine cases of Covid19 in almost 20,000 vaccinated participants compared with 169 cases in a similar number of placebo recipients.  These results far exceeded what had been hoped.  It can be anticipated however that, as vaccine is rolled out in the real world, the effectiveness is likely to drop a little compared to the very controlled clinical trial situation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding safety, local site reactions and, less commonly, more general shortterm systemic reactions such as fatigue, flu-like symptoms and fever, can be anticipated.  These events occurred at increased frequency following the second vaccine dose and were more common in the younger rather than older age groups.  These effects are partly a result of the efficacy of the vaccines in stimulating the immune response.  We will know more detail about the side effects when the licence documentation is published by the EMA.  Reports from the regulatory agencies in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada raised no significant safety concerns.  Reports of anaphylactic-type reaction in two vaccines in the UK outside of the clinical trial naturally draw attention.  Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis or severe immediate allergic reaction is extremely rare.  It is estimated to occur at 1.31 per million vaccine doses.  Its occurrence in the UK is being investigated.  Continued surveillance data is needed to determine whether this was a chance occurrence or whether the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid19 vaccine is associated with a higher risk of allergy compared with other vaccines.<\/p> <p>  It is standard practice for vaccinations to be administered by trained health professionals who are appropriately trained in the management of anaphylaxis and have the appropriate equipment available.  Where there is doubt, rather than forgoing the benefits of vaccination, appropriate advice should be sought from the relevant specialist or the local immunisation team.  NIAC was asked to advise regarding prioritisation for vaccination, given that there will be limited vaccine supply in the initial phases of the rollout.  Recommendations were informed by local epidemiology, focused on the key objectives to prevent Covid19 associated disease and death, while striving to ensure equitable access with attention to the ethical principles of moral equality, minimising harm, fairness and reciprocity.  Recommendations are based on the currently available evidence and are subject to updating and refinement as data pertaining to risk groups is refined, vaccine availability increases and as even more data regarding the different vaccines is collated and analysed.  The document should be regarded as a living document and subject to updating.  In summary, this is an exciting time when we can be filled with hope that we are being equipped to begin a path back towards a more normal lifestyle.  This will not happen overnight.<\/p><p>There are many challenges ahead, including providing clear, accurate, and up-to-date information to potential vaccine recipients such that they can feel fully informed of the potential benefits, the direct benefit in preventing Covid19 for themselves, the benefit of reducing the case numbers for our communities and to accurately balance that against any small but as yet unknown risks that might be associated with vaccinations.<\/p><p> A further challenge is to finalise the development of a national injury redress program to provide support and care in the event that any vaccine recipient develops a serious vaccine reaction as recommended by the WHO.  We have been relatively lucky in Ireland.  Our case numbers are remarkable given what has happened in many other countries in Europe and elsewhere.  Data have shown that in early autumn we were on an identical trajectory to other countries.  Significant restrictions impacting how we live and causing significant economic hardship for some, has brought relief from spiralling case numbers.  However, we cannot continue to depend indefinitely on those measures. <\/p><p> Vaccination is the key that will help open that pathway back to normality.  It is very our hope that in time, this virus will be listed along with other infections such as diphtheria and polio as organisms that vaccination has controlled, if not completely conquered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank everyone for the work they have done and continue to do to address the challenges of Covid-19.

From reading the strategy and the plan, it is clear the guidance and advice received from the European Commission in October has been used to develop these and that the plan is in line with international best practice outlined by the EU, such as ensuring that we view the vaccine as an addition rather than a replacement for other measures, target at-risk groups, resource the deployment properly, and that there is co-operation and consultation with our European partners and neighbours.<\/p> <p>  What engagement has there been with GPs and pharmacists on the roll-out of the plan?  <\/p> <p>  The most important part of the plan is the immense need to build confidence in the vaccine programme and in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.  Five companies have been signed up so far.  It is vital that people are given accurate, factual, objective information about the importance of the vaccine but also its safety and effectiveness.  We saw this in the early stages of Covid when there was a lot of explaining what it was, how it operates, how it spreads, how it effects the body, the signs to watch for and, most importantly, what one needs to do to protect oneself and others.  That is what is needed now.  To what extent has there been engagement in implementing the most effective communication and public awareness campaign?  Have we identified the organisation or agency most responsible for this?  The European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine, while the HPRA advises on the regulation and safety of medicines and vaccines.  Which organisation will lead the information and public awareness campaign?  It is not enough to react; we must actively build and maintain confidence.  False claims and misleading information can spread faster than the virus itself and be just as lethal.  <\/p> <p>  What is the view of the witnesses on actions such as an information booklet being sent to every household with details on vaccines, how they work, what they do and details on the sources of the research and engaging with social media companies including Facebook and Twitter so that inaccurate, misleading or scaremongering claims are marked as disputed in a similar way to some of President Trump's tweets claiming he had won the election are marked as being disputed, and so on?  People could then be directed to an impartial, verified accurate account providing that information.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly agree with the assertion in the implementation plan that vaccines are a proven and cost-effective intervention to protect public health, second only to the provision of clean water.  However, I worry about the impact of campaigns to discredit vaccines.  I fear they will cost lives if we do not prepare properly and proactively.

Specifically on immunisation, it is worth reflecting that significant work was done in the area more generally in regard to the HPV vaccine and the establishment of the Vaccine Alliance back in September 2019.  Hopefully all that will come to fruition - and the alliance has met in recent days - so that we can move this forward.  Significant information is up online both on the HSE website, <i>immunisation.ie<\/i>, and <i>gov.ie\/covid, <\/i>which has specific information on Covid vaccines.<br\/><br\/>As a general point, while obviously we are concerned about misinformation and the extent to which that might influence people's intention to get vaccinated.  It is important we do not give a perception that is a majority view.  We know that 70% to 80% of people in Ireland either definitely or probably will get the vaccine when they are offered.  Perhaps rather than focusing on vaccine hesitancy <i>per se, <\/i>we should promote and build even better levels of vaccine confidence.<\/p><p>What we need to do is continue to build on the basic information materials that were sent out over the past year and, hopefully, over the coming weeks as we get more information from the European Medicines Agency but also in consultation with NIAC, the HPRA and the HSE national immunisation office.

My understanding is that many of these companies have already produced tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of doses that are simply waiting for regulatory approval.  I will start with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  Do we have any idea how many of the 2.2 million doses we are in line to get under the advanced purchase agreement as part of the European Commission's proposals?  Do we have any idea how many of those will come on stream when or if regulatory approval is given?  Let us just that the regulator signs off on this vaccine on whenever date it is.

Regarding the potential imminent granting of conditional marketing authorisation, CMA, possibly as early as 23 December, the only strong indication we have is that a small supply of an initial quantity of vaccines is likely to be delivered to us before the end of December but we do not have confirmed details of exactly what we will be getting and when.

Should the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have to wait in line until their time comes or do our guests think it would helpful, from a public confidence point of view, if they were to receive the vaccine initially?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#F00400","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The useful thing with the list of patient priorities is that it is a transparent description, not just that there are priority groups but that they are arrived at based on the ethical principles that I described and that are contained in the document.

As I said at the beginning, this is a living document.  We have to be pragmatic and flexible.  For example, if a vial of vaccine with five doses in it is being opened and four people who are scheduled turn up to receive it and there is a fifth person in the room who is not on the priority list, the vaccine is not going to be wasted if that fifth person is agreeable to getting it.  There should be that level of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  The point the Deputy has made about people in leadership roles is important and we should be able to do whatever helps people and builds confidence.  However, that does not apply to a point where people feel that we are holding back or depriving someone else.  I am sure that people do not want to be seen as if they are jumping ahead.  This is a finely balanced situation.  There are people who absolutely want to be up there at the front of the line.  We do not want others who feel they should put themselves ahead of the queue.  We have got to be reasonable about it.  That is all I have to say on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about delays.  I am not involved in the logistics of this, but we may get a limited amount of a vaccine.  We all need to recognise the time of year we are in.  The first priorities are people in nursing homes and healthcare professionals.  It is not going to be a matter of completing that as number 1 on the list and moving on to number 2.  We will be looking at what is practical and some of those people may be vaccinated in parallel.  It may not be reasonable to land suddenly at a nursing home to give vaccinations in the period between Christmas and the new year.  People need to have time to get the information and give informed consent.  It may be reasonable to start vaccinating a small group who are at the highest risk.  Those might be the vaccinators themselves or people in critical care areas and emergency rooms.  That kind would be a practical approach to using the vaccine as soon as it becomes available and not delaying anybody's vaccination.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier and as is contained in the statement, all of this has to be done rapidly but not rushed.  Even during the little delays that are occurring at this stage, we are learning as we go along.  We are getting the experience from the beginning of the roll-out in other areas, and all of that is to the good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank all of our guests for their attendance and for the incredible work that they have been doing, particularly in recent times.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions to ask about the practicalities of registration but I will start with one on clinical advice.  I would appreciate a response on it.  It has regard to the potential impact of the vaccine on fertility.  I note that pregnant women are in the 14th category, which is the last, so the question is unlikely to arise for some time.  We also need clarification with regard to breastfeeding mothers.  At yesterday's launch, Dr. Lorraine Nolan said that there are implications for fertility.  Women considering pregnancy or fertility treatment were advised to put that off or, otherwise, to put off having the vaccine.  I know it is early days, but it is important that advice be made available for women in these circumstances, who constitute a big part of the population.

Although pregnant people were excluded from the trials, it is always the case that there are people who do not know they are pregnant or who end up getting pregnant unexpectedly.  There were small numbers of pregnant people in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna trials.  We do not have data on the outcomes for those pregnant people yet.  There is a mood within the State to start trials.  It was a matter of balancing risk.  Some felt that pregnant women should be included.  We will just have to wait for the information.  Pregnant women were not prioritised in this list because of the absence of data.

Basically, that will depend on the information which we will get about all the vaccines.  It might turn out, as it did with the hepatitis B vaccines, for example, that there will be different manufacturers and different products but that they will do the same thing.  Although there may be an attempt to vaccinate the same person with doses of the same product, it does not matter because the vaccines are interchangeable and any of them can be used.

It might be that, ultimately, they will be interchangeable and it will not matter, but we do not know that yet.  When it comes down to it, as well, we will be looking at what data we have on the vaccines and what age groups they might be most effective in.  <\/p> <p>  Some of these types of vaccines might be more effective in older people rather than younger people, and we might choose on that basis.

For now, however, we do not have the data to comment on one versus another.  We really only have data, to any extent, on the Pfizer vaccine, a little bit more on the Moderna and then on the AstraZeneca vaccine.  There have been no head-to-head studies on those vaccines.

My fear is that they will use the confusion around the certificate for people who have taken the vaccine.  He might provide some clarity on his thinking with regard to the certificate.  Some airlines have said they will require the certificate to allow the passenger fly.  I would like to hear his thoughts on those two points initially and I will come back in again with a couple of other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#J00100","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I will start with the second part of the Senator's question about the certificate.  Within the work programme we are on the IT infrastructure and so on.  Discussions are under way about the nature of any potential certificate but it is a certificate of vaccination and nothing else.  That is a record of the fact that one has taken the vaccine, the number of doses and the type of vaccine.  There has been a conflation publicly between a vaccination record or certificate and now the immunity passport, which is something quite different, particularly as we do not have anywhere near enough information about the impact of the vaccines on preventing or reducing transmission.  That will come in time.  Throughout this programme, both at national and European level, there was a long discussion on having a simple record of vaccination, whether that be a hard copy or a digital or both, but those discussions have not concluded yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>If I may add to that, and Professor Butler may want to come on this, the information is not available.

On the first point, there is a real risk that premature complacency will set in over these weeks as people, very understandably, see hope on the horizon but, as I said previously, unfortunately, a vaccine simply will not come soon enough to have any positive effect at a population level.  As soon as it is rolled out, it will have a wonderful beneficial protective effective for the individuals who get it in the first instance but we are looking at a number of months before we see a vaccine having a significant effect on how we manage this disease overall in Ireland.  Unfortunately, our messaging will not be changing any time soon.  Whether a vaccine comes next week, the week after or the week after that, the reality is that, unfortunately, for the next number of months we will ask people to continue with all of the basic measures that have been so important over the past year and to which people have been so good at adhering.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's second point, the situation in Northern Ireland is of real concern.  NPHET will meet tomorrow and will consider both that situation and the situation internationally.  The situation internationally over the past number of weeks can only be described as devastating when we look at the number of people in intensive care across Europe and the number of deaths and hospitalisations.  NPHET's primary concern is the situation here in Ireland and while we have avoided to a large extent what has happened internationally over recent weeks, I emphasise again that our situation is very fragile.  We have seen numbers tick up in recent days and the indicators are that, unfortunately, we have bottomed out in terms of it being as good as it was going to get and are beginning to see a deterioration once again.

On the definition of \"key workers\", in the document educated staff such as teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and childcare workers are not defined as a key worker, which seems strange.  They are in a different category, which comes after key workers.  There are many comments online and fun things on Twitter about people being at this or that level on the list but what jumped out at me was our definitions.  How flexible or malleable will they be as we go along or are they set in stone?<\/p> <p>  People aged between 18 and 64 who are living or working in crowded situations will be considered quite high up the list but how will we define that?  How will people be able to prove that they are in that position?  Those can be quite personal details and I am wondering how a person would go about proving that they deserve to be further up the list because of an unfortunate living situation that may be out of their control.  What steps will be taken to deal with that sensitively but also how will that be proven?

There are two factors to this, the first of which is how high the risk is for people who cannot maintain social distancing.  Teachers have done a fantastic job in schools, in that they are able to maintain social distancing.  They are young and in a situation where transmission is not as great a problem as it can be in other settings, but their risk of adverse outcomes is much lower than some of the people who are at higher risk.

Usually, we rely on information from a GP referral letter, from direct contact with the GP on people coming into hospital, their background, their medications and their vaccination history, if it is relevant.  In this case, a great enabler will be the universal health identifier, which is used for e-referrals and school vaccination programmes.

As I said earlier, we want to give certainty to members of the public around this and to manage their expectations in as transparent a way as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":586,"content":"<p>If it will be mid-February for that cohort, what about healthcare workers?

We are just indicating to the committee that we are working through real data across all of the cohorts and through various potential vaccine arrival schedules.

Professor MacCraith has already said that there will be a campaign to combat any negativity that may arise from certain quarters, including from conspiracy theorists.  It is hugely important to be able to rebut their arguments instantly and to do so authoritatively.  The scientific evidence and information necessary to rebut them must be readily available.

What has been proven internationally over time is that as important as responding to misinformation - which is clearly very important, as we have seen over the last year in terms of Covid-19 more generally - is ensuring that the basic correct information is put out regularly, transparently, as quickly as we have it to hand and in a form that is digestible for the public.  It needs to be in many different forms because people digest information in many different ways.  As I said earlier, there will be a campaign at national level but at local level elected representatives, GPs, pharmacists, healthcare professionals of all types as well as community organisations and others will have a fundamental role to play in addressing misinformation over the coming months.

Can the witnesses assure us that they will not be pulling front-line staff away from the provision of already-delayed services, such as processing primary medical certificates, to carry out the vaccination programme?<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Henry for his clarification on informed consent in the context of vulnerable settings but I ask him to provide us with a copy of the protocol to which he referred.  I also ask him to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that a code of conduct is issued to all of our nursing home settings around the country detailing how they should engage with older people.  Naturally enough, older people are going to start asking questions as soon as the first vaccine is approved.  It is very important that they are not told that they will not have access to X or Y service if they do not avail of the vaccine so that they are giving proper, informed consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#M01200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I will start with the final point first.  We have built up experience in informed consent for vaccination programmes among older people with the pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza vaccine programmes.  Deputy Naughten is correct that they should never involve a threat, direct, indirect or otherwise, and should involve providing information in a way that a person can best understand the benefits and risks.  The principle of informed consent has evolved over the years.  It is not a binary concept.  It is complex.  In this case, it is the duty of the healthcare provider, namely, ourselves, to explain things as best we can, according to each individual situation.  That includes people who may have cognitive impairment.  They should not be excluded from consent just because they are on a journey of cognitive impairment towards dementia.  Our colleagues in nursing and GPs who vaccinate older people have a lot of experience in explaining the benefits of vaccines.  They trust that older people, like younger people, are able to ask for the information that is important to them.  It is obvious to everybody that they have suffered greatly, not just in terms of the impact of the virus, but from the impact of the social restrictions.  I hope we would be leading from the front and providing impartial, correct information to people.  My guess is that based on the optics from the influenza vaccine this season, which has been taken up at very high levels among this age group, we would see a big appetite among older people for a vaccine that would reduce what is a very high risk for some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Is there a response on the adequacy of the legislation in terms of the unique identifier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#N00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I asked about the unique identifier amending legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#N00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Will anyone comment on that?

It is more to do with the UK but it is what we are looking for as well.  We are looking for a level playing field in order that we can still compete in Europe.  We are an island off an island and we cannot change the time that ferries take but it leads to logistical nightmares and other issues with which we need some assistance to keep on that playing field.<\/p><p> The Irish road hauliers have responded over the years to the requirements of industry and customers, whatever they may be.  They have given a very good and thorough service to the customers and by doing so, we may have somewhat inadvertently created an excellent, streamlined and efficient business to take the goods of Ireland to market and the requirements of Ireland home.  We must do our best and perhaps go the extra steps in order to keep that streamlined service in place.  That is why we are here today.<\/p><p> At the outset, I commend the committee on having us here today and it is vital that it retains its vigilance and interest in what happens to our freight and transport industry in the coming months.  The committee has a particular role in holding the State and its agencies to account to ensure that they do their jobs properly and place the needs and well-being of our citizens to the fore of their consideration and focus.  It is very important that the committee understands that the next four weeks will be a period of unprecedented disruption for the movement of goods in Ireland.  The period might stretch longer than four weeks because of stockpiling, and there may be a quiet period in January.  I can reassure the committee that the disruption is on the way nonetheless.<\/p><p> For the first time in nearly 50 years, we will be back with customs and import controls coming and going to the island.  Even if a deal is reached and implemented between the EU and the UK on tariffs, the new arrangements involving inspections by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will create hold-ups at our ports and airports.  For hauliers, these disruptions and obstructions will have catastrophic consequences if the process is not streamlined as much as possible.<\/p><p> For a start we do not influence the scheduling of ferries, the opening of terminals or the management of traffic at our ports and approaching roads.  We are entirely dependent on the people who run the ferries, control the ports and manage the traffic to ensure that they operate effectively and efficiently.  Even without the new checks and controls, our ports are heavily congested at certain peak times.  God only knows what the level of disruption will be in the weeks ahead.  For our members, these new checks and controls will have huge implications and massive consequences.<\/p><p> As hauliers we are under considerable pressure to get our goods to their destination on time and in good condition for our customers.  Our drivers also operate under strict tachograph rules, which tightly regulate their driving hours.  If a driver goes over his or her hours, for example, while waiting for a customs or departmental check, he or she is hit by a mandatory rest period and can go no further.  The driver would have to park up in the parking spaces of these authorities and cannot move if he or she is over that time.  The disruption that this will cause is immense and has the capacity to slow the licensed haulage industry and introduce a logistical nightmare.<\/p><p> What can be done to ensure that we reduce the risks of delay, congestion and disruption to trade?  First, it is vital that there is a single entity that takes responsibility for the free movement of traffic at our ports so that this does not fall between the cracks.  For example, in Dublin Port, where any delays and congestion could be acute when the new system of checks and controls is introduced, the movement of traffic into and around the port falls to no fewer than six separate entities.  These are Dublin Port Company, Dublin City Council, the National Roads Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport.  Some single entity needs to take overall control and responsibility for traffic into out of and around the port as otherwise, the ball will be passed from Billy to Jack and we will end up with unco-ordinated chaos.<\/p><p> Let us tackle the obvious pressure points which we can do something about.  For example, it is completely insane that the main roll-on, roll-off ferry services in Dublin Port all arrive and depart roughly within 30 minutes, 45 minutes or an hour of each other.  The main four services in the morning come in between 5.30 a.m. and 6.30 a.m., and they reload and get ready to go back out to sea within 45 minutes to an hour between 8 a.m. and 9.15 a.m.  This schedule ensures that there is massive pressure on facilities and the road network at specific times rather than being spread throughout the day.  It makes sense that in the context of the challenges that Brexit will present, the schedules for these ferries should be spread out and not so concentrated.  It is plain that we are creating this congestion ourselves and something will have to change.<\/p><p> This is happening when the ro-ro depots are opening in the morning.  If the ferry companies do not make these changes themselves, then the port authorities should force them to do so and use whatever statutory powers they have to control ships within the ports under the Harbours Acts.  There is also an added concern that we need to be assured that the ferry companies are not acting in unison, talking to each other or doing anything uncompetitive.  I am not saying they are but the regulatory authorities should keep an eye on this and ensure it does not happen.<\/p><p> We also need the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Department of Transport to observe that this is going on and that this is not business as usual.  They must recognise that licensed hauliers will face unprecedented challenges due to obstructions and delays and as such, they require an element of flexibility in the application of existing rules.  We are not talking about compromising road safety or driver welfare, but instead about taking account of the acute pressure and stress on the sector with a more purposeful enforcement regime.  They should actively pursue the scope for any derogations that can be applied for the next extraordinary period.  Some of the very tight rules around the tachograph can be adjusted, as was done at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is not a very big adjustment but at least it allows flexibility and an easing of how we do business and allows us to get on with it a bit better.<\/p><p> Finally, it is imperative that the State agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, the HSE, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport, which are going to be conducting the inspections and controls at our ports, deploy adequate resources and technology to allow them to do so with the least disruption possible.  The inspection points need to be manned to meet demand, and IT should be used to the maximum to ensure that drivers can prepare for and minimise delays.  A risk-based approach should be adopted to inspections.<\/p><p> The success or failure of Ireland&rsquo;s preparation for Brexit will not be on the shoulders of us but rather it will firmly rest with the State and the different State agencies that have been asked by the Government to carry out the preparations.  We are asking that this committee should be fearless and relentless in holding these entities to account to do their job as efficiently as possible.  They may need to take some steps outside their own remit, by which I mean that the liaison between customs staff here and their counterparts in different countries must be to facilitate the bringing about of practical steps to facilitate the streamlined movement of freight.<\/p><p> For example, some of the direct ferries are now in operation for the Continent and the main hub of Europe.  They will be the ship of choice for most people but there will be times, perhaps as a result of sea conditions or customs requirements, when we will have to go through the land bridge of England.  We also have a great fisheries industry, including shellfish, and with what is called a groupage load, a number of small fisheries people may send to destinations across northern France and perhaps down to Spain.  That groupage requires a set of papers to be declared.  We accept that we have to declare this in Dublin or Holyhead but what is declared in Dublin should be accepted immediately by France.<\/p><p>Ireland is an EU country and we are only using Britain as a land bridge.  Trucks are sealed and when they arrive in France, the register coming off the ship should be accepted.  We should flow on simply with the paperwork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Drennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":620,"content":"<p>That is a matter the committee can explore.

Brexit and its potential fallout comprised a recurring theme throughout.  The guest speakers were talking all things Brexit but, to my surprise, the conversation was centred mainly on air passengers travelling through the UK, with no reference to what Brexit could mean for our supply chain.  The supply chain is the roof over our heads, the clothes on our back and the food on our table, etc.  Transport drives our supply chain and thus it is the backbone of our economy.  From the conference, it became evident to me quickly that change in transport methodology was needed.<br\/><br\/>The discussions today should not just focus on damage limitation in respect of how we can avoid delays on the UK land bridge and minimise the risk and disruption of such delays; rather, we should use these discussions to understand how we can shape an autonomous supply chain, how the Government can invest in our air, sea and road freight models to deliver a supply chain infrastructure that can underpin our economy and express our vision as a country to prospective foreign direct investors and opportunities in the e-commerce and logistics space.  <br\/><br\/>My expertise specifically relates to the air freight model, which is built on the components of speed and time-definite delivery.  I began my career in freight forwarding in 1981.  I have worked at home and abroad in leading senior management positions, and I became CEO of one of Ireland's leading mid-west freight-forwarding companies.  The company ceased trading during the economic crash in 2009 and I have worked as a consultant since then.  This experience has allowed me to evaluate Brexit and identify the three key risks that present themselves to the air freight modelfrom 1 January.<br\/><br\/>Before I move on to the risk assessment, it is important to provide context.  The most recent Irish air freight study outlined how air freight represented less than 1% of the export volume but equated to 30% of total exports by value.  This is also representative of global trends.  The exports of 2019 were valued at &euro;152 billion so clearly air freight is an extremely important cog in the Irish economic machine.  To break down that number further, we estimate that more than half of that air freight is currently using the UK land bridge for global forwarding from UK and EU airports.  <br\/><br\/>The first and most immediate and obvious risk to this air freight model are the bottlenecks that will, and already have started, to present themselves in the UK.  Speed and time-definite delivery are foundations of our air freight model, which overnight will be in complete disarray.<br\/><br\/>The second key risk relates to the sphere of influence the UK will maintain over our supply chain after Brexit due to our over-reliance on the UK land bridge.  The purpose of Brexit is for the UK to take control of its own destiny, but a by-product of that process is that it will also assume a level of control over our supply chain.  <br\/><br\/>The final key risk identified, which is not exclusively related to the air freight model, relates to the transfer of data.  The UK land bridge will facilitate the transfer of key economic data through customs AEP and documentation to UK customs, now that the UK is a third country and trading competitor.  This is confidential economic data pertaining to our supply chain.  <br\/><br\/>The solution, unfortunately, is not the daily ferry service direct to France because this increases the key risk to the air freight model, which is speed.  The solution is a cargo air bridge service into Liege that bypasses the UK.  This will provide speed, reliability and autonomy to our air freight model and ultimately our supply chain.  The investment in the cargo air bridge service not only solves a Brexit problem but also enhances Ireland's value proposition to prospective foreign direct investors and indigenous entrepreneurs.  <br\/><br\/>I have put together an experienced team that has the skill set required to create, operate, manage and further develop a cargo air bridge service for the Irish market in the most efficient and cost-effective way.  Our team has broad experience of leadership and experience of all modes of domestic and international transport, including broad experience in logistics, avionics, IT and finance.  <br\/><br\/>The landscape of global trade has significantly changed in recent years, particularly with the emergence of e-commerce increasing the reliance on just-in-time cargo and logistics from business to end user.  It is time for Ireland's supply chain model to adapt.  It is time to put a best-in-class supply chain model in place in terms of connectivity and reliability.  The Government has an opportunity to make a clear statement to the world that we are open for business and we mean business by investing in a cargo air bridge service.  It is a simple choice: fall behind under UK control or create a world-leading air cargo hub to service current and future foreign direct investment and Irish indigenous manufacturing, including e-commerce and logistics industries supported by the Irish Government and the IDA, creating thousands of jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Callaghan.

The route will be serviced by three ferries, each with a capacity of in the region of 125 lorries, both accompanied and unaccompanied.<br\/><br\/>DFDS Seaways Ireland was proud to announce this morning that the route will commence with the chartered ships <i>MS Visby<\/i>and <i>MV Kerry<\/i>, along with our own DFDS ship, <i>Optima Seaways<\/i>.  The route will initially be serviced with six weekly departures from each port, with a crossing time of 23 hours and 50 minutes.  From the outset, this will predominantly be seen as a freight service, reserving all cabins for freight drivers because the route has been initiated to support the Irish industry.  After Covid-19, however, we might open up to accommodating passengers.<br\/><br\/>A new company, DFDS Seaways Ireland Limited, has been formed under the stewardship of the DFDS A\/S umbrella in Denmark to develop this essential route to give direct connectivity between Ireland and mainland Europe after Brexit.  DFDS has 154 years of experience in international shipping.  It has a very large team of industry professionals on hand as it develops the new direct service.<br\/><br\/>We at DFDS are extremely pleased to offer customers in Ireland the opportunity to transport goods directly to or from other EU countries without the customs formalities and possible waiting times that the end of the Brexit transition period will bring about for the road haulage industry.  The route will be registered as a regular shipping service, ensuring all goods transported remain within the Single Market and customs union.  Over the past nine months, we have carried out extensive market research in all areas, including volume, capacity, speed, frequency and, most important, location of ports.  Both Rosslare Europort and the port of Dunkirk were selected for their strategic locations, accessibility and preparedness for Brexit, with both having systems in place to ensure direct free-flowing access for Europe-bound traffic.<br\/><br\/>Timing and frequency are important because, upon arrival in Dunkirk or Rosslare, drivers will be fully rested, will be able to continue driving immediately and will be able to reach their many major destinations within their legal driving limit.  In addition, the sea voyage will reduce the dependency on the UK land bridge and open direct opportunities for trade within the EU Single Market.  Since the announcement of our service on 27 November 2020, we have received many inquiries and bookings because many manufacturers and producers, along with haulage industry professionals, are looking for new direct routes to mainland Europe while keeping their goods within the Single Market.  The new line will create jobs and activities in Rosslare and Cork, where DFDS will be represented by new offices, and in Dunkirk.  In Ireland, the route will be led by me, as route director, and Mr. Darren Mooney, as sales and customer service director.  We are extremely grateful for the support we have received from the port of Rosslare, namely from the general manager, Mr. Glenn Carr, and his team, and from the port of Dunkirk.  Their flexibility, professionalism and excellent co-operation have enabled us to be ready with this service before the end of the transition period at the end of the year.  We are confident the service will benefit customers on both sides of the route.  We acknowledge the assistance of the Department of Transport, the Customs and Excise, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda and the Irish Road Haulage Association to date in helping us to bring this service to fruition in such a short period.<\/p><p>We look forward to continuing to work with them in the coming weeks as we prepare for the launch on 2 January.

We completely changed our views two years ago regarding the potential of Ireland.  We originally operated a route between Cork and Santander twice a week but we have now moved it from Cork to Rosslare and from Santander to Bilbao because we were slightly disappointed by the volumes at the beginning.  There was also a security issue in Santander relating to migrants.  We currently operate the service twice a week between Rosslare and Bilbao.<br\/><br\/>For the information of the committee, the service has a potential capacity of 20,000 pieces of freight per year.  In recent weeks, we have seen a surge in demand for the service, which is very pleasing.  We have gone from an average of 30 to 35 units per departure to well over 60 units.  There is capacity for up to 110 units.  It is very pleasing that Irish and Spanish hauliers are starting to use that service, which we opened two years ago in preparation for Brexit and the issues with the land bridge.  Complementary to this service, on the Ireland-France connection, with the same vessels that operate on the Rosslare-Bilbao route, we will operate a service between Rosslare and Cherbourg.  That comes in addition to Stena Line and Irish Ferries services on the route.  In 2021 we will deploy another ship, the <i>Armorique<\/i>, to travel between Cork and Roscoff, which will provide further freight capacity.<br\/><br\/>In a nutshell, Brittany Ferries will go from historically having one passenger service crossing per week on the <i>Pont-Aven<\/i>to having five departures per week in 2021 with much more freight capacity.  If my mathematics are correct, these services will be able to transport up to the equivalent of 30,000 freight units out of Ireland and directly to France or Spain.  Brittany Ferries identified there was a business case for the service, as did my colleagues in DFDS, Stena Line and Irish Ferries.  We recognise it is very important for Ireland to have these direct connections to the Continent.  Cobelfret has also has reinforced its capacity out of Ireland.  I fully understand that there is nervousness because there will still be some requirement to go across the UK and the land bridge.  However, the ferry industry has seriously developed its capacity out of Ireland.  There is still room for more freight.  For example, we are averaging 60 to 65 units per departure on our route to Spain but there is room to go to 100 units.  Of course, we will all be watching very carefully in January and February as things unfold and Brexit becomes a reality.  We will adapt upwards if there is demand for more capacity.  Those are my comments at this stage regarding Brittany Ferries and our recent development of routes out of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christophe Mathieu"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I particularly welcome Mr. O'Callaghan and Mr. Regan of Cargo Logistics.  I have been in contact with them in recent weeks and, through the committee, invited them to attend the meeting.  I am delighted to see them here.  In the world of cargo, they have always offered solutions and they are now offering an economic solution to what is a real pickle for this country as we face Brexit, with or without a deal, in a matter of weeks.<\/p> <p>  I have highlighted at the committee in recent weeks that Boston Scientific brings cargo freight to Shannon Airport every day.  Each crate is worth approximately &euro;1 million.  The freight is made up of high-quality medical components to be shipped around the world.  The crates sit 100 m away from perfect aircraft but they are trucked at night all the way down the motorway to Rosslare, brought by ferry to Britain and, ultimately, are loaded onto an aeroplane at Heathrow to make their way around the world.  Key opportunities are being lost.  What is the value of the air cargo out of Ireland on which we are losing out?  Which Irish airport is best positioned in terms of hangar space and runway length to cater for air cargo?  It concerns me that air cargo currently only accounts for 1% of all exports leaving Ireland yet its value is extremely high, accounting for 30%.<\/p> <p>  I have been looking at a few international models.  In geographic terms, Luxembourg is probably in a very enviable position at the heart of Europe but it is quite a small nation.  Its Government has taken a 56.6% share in Cargolux, ensuring that at all times there is high value and high quantities of air cargo in and out of the country, which keeps the economy afloat.  It is also profitable for the Luxembourg Government, with average profits in recent years of approximately &euro;200 million.  Regardless of passengers, Brexit or Covid, there will always be a need for cargo crates to be loaded onto aeroplanes and brought around the world.  Have the witnesses looked at the Cargolux model?  It certainly works well in continental Europe.<\/p> <p>  I put Cargo Logistics in contact with the Shannon Group.

To look at another example, the German Government owns DHL.  Deutsche Bank, which is owned by the German Government, owns DB Schenker.  The logistics and freight forwarding industry is a profitable industry if it is done right.  DHL became a conglomerate through global purchasing of other companies.

On customs and booking ferries, anything that has to travel has to be declared now, which it did not have to be before with the free movement of goods.  If we are going on direct ferries it is still covered in the free movement of goods, but the Irish-UK trade is 1 million movements a year.  It is a &euro;5 billion market.  It is massive and way bigger than it was in the past when there were customs in the past.  When we declare the goods that have to travel, it creates a pre-boarding number, PBN.

If the customs union has to be adjusted to take care of that, then it has to be adjusted.<\/p> <p>  Airfreight, for example, travels on a number.  There is a master number for the total of the consignment and they do not care how it travels around the world, through airports, any which way, because when it arrives, once it is complete and in front of the authorities who want to charge a tariff or seize it, it is fine.  However, here we have to declare everything for the big volume of goods that we move.  Such an adjustment would be a big help.<\/p> <p>  While a lot of work is done through the agencies within their agency and within their remit, which I would like to acknowledge, they would want to step outside their boxes and see how it joins together.  The connectivity of the jigsaw has not been there.  There has not been an overarching body to see what it all does.  We badly need an Irish system that speaks to the English system.  They are on two different platforms, so it is necessary to redeclare.  IT has become so sophisticated, if we create this electronic envelope, it should travel easily and not have to stop.  We have to stop if we are called by the regulatory authorities, but other than that, it should try to keep the free flow.  What I said about fish also applies to loads of beef or other agriculture commodities or any product.  When we arrive in France, the PBN will be related to the regulatory authority of the country we come into, and they know we have come through - it is all intact and sealed - and drive on.  It is free movement.  Ireland has free movement of goods in the EU, and that should be the way.  France has no discharge offices at the ports.  We have to travel six to ten miles one way or the other to discharge a document that should be done electronically.  That would let the goods flow.<\/p> <p>  The existing ferries, Stena and Irish Ferries, do a very good service to the Continent, but the timeline and the insistence on them keeping up to their schedule is crucial to Ireland and to the date and time on goods now, to make sure we get to market.  If a person is not in Rungis at 5 a.m. and is supposed to be at a French meat market, the load will be sold off, discounted somewhere, and it will be of very little value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Drennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":648,"content":"<p>There are too many people to welcome everyone but I thank them for coming.

We need them to be open late into the evening so that trucks will come in, reload and not be around in the morning.  It is very simple.  When the container depots open, we must get the ones that take in the empty containers who are outside the port.  They have to mirror it.  The container operators can dictate that.  They can dictate the time they want the port open.  It must be opened or we create this.<\/p> <p>  If we look at what is coming down the line, when the ferries come in, they are at the end of the piers.

It has been tried previously, or parts of it have been tried previously, and that proved to be a difficulty.

Deputy Mythen referred to it as well, and the traffic line.  The fact that the agricultural inspectorate in Rosslare Europort intends to close from 12 noon to 2 p.m. at the height of Brexit is crazy.  It should not be allowed happen in a port that is hoping to be a tier 1 port in Europe.  It cannot be allowed to happen.  Perhaps to sustain 24 hours at the start might be a little high to request, but there definitely should be 16 hours' cover of the agencies in Rosslare to keep it going.  In addition, Rosslare may not cause as much trouble as Dublin due to its nature and the road network around it.<\/p><p>The parking area for some of the agencies is limited.  They intend there being a quota status from the port up to whatever agency you have to call to, but if they do not take the trucks in quickly, as we are on split break, we have to go on break.  Then we have to stay in the port and we will block up Rosslare port.  These are the issues the State agencies have to take account of.<\/p><p> Likewise, Customs, if its officials have anything like a seal check and a slight paperwork check to conduct, should do them quickly, not as if they will \"get around to you when they are ready\".  If one is on the lesser of the checks, these should be done quickly.  They should keep them moving.<\/p><p> There was also a reference to the information technology.  I referenced it previously.

They are pouring out 600 trucks at one end at the same as the trucks to reload are entering at the other end, plus the container lines which are to the right of the ferries.  The containers will have a separate entry now but at the same time, the movement is circular.  If any of those containers is called to customs checks, they are all within the main ports.  The customs checks are on the right, as you come up from the port.  You have to cross the road for the most part.  You have to come up to the roundabout above it and join the inward flow.  Then when they are done, they join the outward flow.  Once you start that circular movement, as any committee member will know from any town or village that puts in a one-way system, although it may free up the flow of traffic, it also builds up a backlog of traffic.

I was also wondering to what extent it would be wise, from the Republic of Ireland point of view, to be clear to identify which hauliers carry which type of goods, because I presume it is much more of an issue if medicines or first-necessity goods were to be late versus some other types of goods.  That is just an aside on the question, but I was just wondering whether the Republic of Ireland could work with hauliers like Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Stena, and Irish Ferries for that matter, to identify a priority list.  That would be one way to mitigate the risk of shortage in the first few weeks.  I know I am addressing a different issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christophe Mathieu"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":784,"content":"<p>Nonetheless, it is important.

I was at a meeting of another committee at which a number of votes were to be held today, so Deputy Mythen substituted for me for part of this meeting.  We have raised a number of these issues with the Minister, for example, the demand for additional ferry crossings.  The Minister has told us either that there is no demand or that it is up to the hauliers to contact the ferry companies to outline their needs.  What we are hearing with regard to the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, report is significant.  There were criticisms of it and we have heard confirmation from Mr. Coffey.  We had representatives of the ports before the committee and they had a list of things they wanted to see happen.  The first thing they wanted was staggered arrival times.  They said this could not be secured because they had been told the hauliers wanted it that way.  It seems we are hearing about the same problems from different groups but they are not being resolved.  It is almost as if those conversations are happening with us or with Government rather than between the parties involved.<\/p> <p>  What do the witnesses believe is the proper forum in which to thrash out these issues?  Who are the responsible authorities?  Mr. Drennan mentioned State agencies.  What are the agencies who need to hear this message loud and clear?  What needs to happen between now and the end of the year or the early part of the new year to straighten this stuff out?  I would appreciate the witnesses' opinions on those matters.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of other specific issues I wish to raise.  People may have an idea what will happen early in the new year.  With specific regard to a Covid-19 vaccine, are there threats to logistics as regards cold transit?  Are there threats to the logistics in that regard?  There is also the issue of just-in-time delivery for fresh goods.  I have a family connection with regard to livestock.  With regard to livestock haulage, we see queues of 15 km or 20 km in other places.  What are the considerations or risks in that regard from the witnesses' perspective?  My principal questions, however, are those I asked earlier.  What needs to happen?  What does Government need to hear from the representative groups here today and who else needs to hear from them?  What needs to happen in the coming weeks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#M01500","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":814,"content":"<p>We are here to clarify the Deputy's questions and to clear the air on some of these issues.  As regards the Minister and the IMDO report, that report certainly clouded the waters.  It was not great and could not stand up.  If there were not capacity issues, these big firms would not have come in.  DFDS had to declare its intentions to the stock exchange in Denmark before it came here, which gave the move great clout.  DFDS was willing to do that, which answers that question very clearly.  I believe the report clouded the Minister's thinking.  I heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs talking about capacity.  Everybody started talking about capacity, which distracted from the issues I have spoken about such as timelines and service lines.  That takes care of that question.<\/p> <p>  As to who has to take this forward and try to get the companies to do what we are requesting, I am not knowledgeable about the legalities facing Dublin Port as a State or semi-State agency but it is owned by the State.  We are talking about private companies whose vessels are not even flagged in this country.  With regard to trade between Ireland and England, the two ferry companies who should have been here to answer questions today have a captive audience of 1 million crossings of freight alone, without mentioning tourism and cars.
