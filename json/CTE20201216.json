Last week, we had the pleasure of meeting officials from the Department of Justice and the Prison Service to raise a number of issues.  There is one issue that I had raised at our very first meeting as part of the main reason to bring them in  I refer to the fact that following the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 17 January 2019 I had raised the issue of an alleged sexual assault against an agency nurse working in the Prison Service.  I understood from Mr. Don Culliton, who represented the Prison Service last January and again last week, that they would look into the matter.  Since then, the person in question has taken a case to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and there has been a ruling.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the relevant Deputy, although not named but it was me, were named in the judgment.  It was found that as a direct result of the case being mentioned at our meeting on 17 January 2019 the person had all of their shifts cancelled so had to find alternative work and as a result was granted an award that is a matter of public record.  Naturally, when the Committee of Public Accounts came together first, I said that we should want to raise the matter.  While I appreciate Standing Order 218, which seeks to reaffirm historic limitations without any leeway, the Prison Service and the Department should have been in the invitation to last week's meeting under notice that we were going to raise that matter.  It is shocking that a court ruled that as a direct result of something being raised here, and a matter so serious as a sexual assault, would lead to somebody in the judge's opinion losing their job and getting compensation, appropriately.<\/p> <p>  Now it seems that the State is appealing the case.  The nature of how it was dealt with last week by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and the Prison Service was appalling.  It was totally unfair to the committee and totally unfair to the victim.  The Accounting Officer for the Department of Justice owes an explanation to this committee as to what their position is on having been found to be liable for taking action against somebody because a matter was raised at this meeting.  These are not my words.  That was the judgment.<\/p> <p>  Last week, we were stonewalled.  I think I used the phrase \"How people like Maurice McCabe ever managed to get justice is beyond me\" because if somebody in the Prison Service came to me with a complaint today I would genuinely advise them not to issue a protective disclosure, not to make a complaint and not to have it raised at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts because other apparatus in the State will move directly to throw them under the bus.  While I appreciate that I can be abrupt and robust in my questioning, which is unnerving for people and is probably unseemly to watch but it was necessary.  I am appalled at what took place at last week's meeting with the Department of Justice and the Prison Service because we were merely making up the numbers.  It was a total waste of taxpayers' money considering the lack of candour, directness and basic respect shown to what is the only constitutional committee in the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00300","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>People will continue to have a problem as long as the power imbalance has been shifted so much in respect of Standing Order 218.  It almost works against the committee and in favour of the witnesses so I do not see how we can continue, and effectively do our work, without change or a rebalancing of Standing Order 218.  We must redouble our efforts to do that.  It is like having a pair of handcuffs on and I found it quite difficult to straddle that in the Chair last week.  It is obvious that there has been a shift.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00400","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I was not here last week but I am aware of the case where a judgment was made in favour of a former worker in the Prison Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I have raised Standing Order 218 previously and I said that the issue would become more prevalent and it has, unfortunately.  I am a new member of the committee and at the initial meeting, we were greeted with the new Standing Order 218.  From my understanding of the committee prior to joining it, the Standing Order has put the kibosh on our ability to question witnesses or certainly put pressure on the Chair to ensure that there is compatibility with the Standing Orders of the House.<\/p> <p>   I ask that the impact on our committee be analysed at the weekly meeting of the Oireachtas committee chairman and, indeed, by the Committee on Procedure, of which I understand I am now a member.  I really think it only impacts on this committee and not so on others.  It is imperative that we do that because when Covid is over and we have longer than two-hour sessions with witnesses, the impact of the Standing Order will come into shaper focus and be unfair to this committee.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy eloquently said, it will impact more so on us as committee members and favour those who are here as witnesses.  It is important that we deal with this matter as soon as possible, preferably in January, before the committee meets again.  I appeal to the Chairman, as the guardian of the committee, that we deal with this matter. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00600","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My views on Standing Order 218 are well known.  I agree with what has been said about it imposing a stricture on us.  There are two issues with the Standing Order.<\/p><p>One interpretation is that it is there to prevent us from discussing matters that should properly be before another committee, such as the health or justice committees.  That is fair enough.  From my perspective as Chairman, I do not want to get involved in some kind of jostling match with the Chairmen of other committees or the committees themselves.  I am sure members are reasonable enough to know that there is no need for us to do that and that there are capable people on all the committees across the Houses.  That is one interpretation.  There is a procedure, where that needs to be adjudicated on, to send a request to the Committee on Procedure.  This is what we have been told legally.  There would be a turnaround time of a week.  I understand that this in the Standing Orders of the Committee on Procedure, which is welcome enough in itself.  <br\/><br\/>However, there is a bigger issue.  We have had witnesses before committee meetings, including Secretaries General, where things were completely free-flowing and there were no objections to asking any questions about anything.  In fact, I and other members asked one Secretary General not just about the past but the present.  We also discussed the future with him.  He was very forthcoming, which is his style.  I also know that in the case of other witnesses, I had to intervene to tell them they had to answer the question.  It can be used to close down questioning from members.  I do not want to preside over meetings like that.  It puts me in a difficult position and it restricts things.  I am not completely <i>au fait<\/i>with that particular issue but from members are saying here, I take it that this problem has popped up and we need to try to circumvent and deal with it.  The Deputy is correct.  This committee is the one that will be restricted.  Constitutionally, the Committee of Public Accounts is the one place where we can bring people before us to get answers, to discuss and analyse what is going on and to issue reports.  It is important that we do not restrict that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#F00700","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Last week was a prime example of the effects of Standing Order 218 and how it ties the hands of committee members.  The whole purpose of the committee involves its probing nature and accountability systems, practice and procedures.  Because of that Standing Order, witnesses who may have felt that they were coming in for quite a grilling if there was justification relating to practice and procedures will be only be too happy.  I do not see how it serves the purpose of this committee.  It would serve witnesses who are not forthcoming with information when requested.  Regarding the practice whereby witnesses refuse to answer continues, if we had a penny for every time we were told last week that someone could not answer this or that question, we would be rich.  If it is not changed, it will continuously make the purpose and remit of the committee more and more redundant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#G00200","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As a member of the committee, I take exception to what the Chairman said about him as Chairman and other committees not having to jostle over certain issues.  I think the Committee of Public Accounts does trump a number of committees.  They may decide they want to discuss certain issues with certain witnesses but from the point of view of public accountability, we should have the privilege of inviting witnesses in and discussing certain issues irrespective of whether another committee also wants to do that because we cut through the issue of whether it has a certain departmental aspect, be it health or education.  We can still invite them in and it is important for this committee to retain the ability to do that.  Standing Order 218 affects our ability to question those witnesses.  Irrespective of whether any other committee has standing in the House to do that with that organisation, we should still be able to do that.  I would not like us to lose that ability.  I would like us to retain it and through the Chairman, I would like us to push for that more.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, of all committees, this committee needs to ensure that Standing Order 218 has a better re-balancing for committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2020121600002#G00300","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1608136200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.

We have a problem in the sense that over 2,500 organisations are getting funding from the HSE.  I remember raising an issue relating to an organisation that I wanted to invite before the Oireachtas Committee on Health but we were advised that we could not get it in because the Committee of Public Accounts was dealing with section 38 and section 39 organisations, which I thought was wrong.  In fairness to the Committee of Public Accounts, it could only deal with one or two organisations at the time with regard to cross-examination, whereas the Committee on Health could easily have dealt with other issues.  We need to be careful that we do not prevent other committees from looking at other issues.  Regardless of whether organisations come under the remit of the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Health, we should not prevent other committees from pursuing other aspects.<\/p> <p>  The Committee of Public Accounts still has fairly extensive powers relating to accountability.  The one difficulty we have is that where there is any litigation involving an issue coming before us, it is impossible to deal with any of that.

As it was within the remit of the 2019 accounts, Standing Order 218 was not an issue.  A peculiar angle that was taken that we do not discuss individual cases.  I do not know any law against that.  That might be a practice that is adopted but if we have an individual case, for example, a protected disclosure, there is nothing in law that prevents the relevant Accounting Officer saying &quot;we got that, we're working through that and here's what happening with it.&quot;  There is nothing to prevent that but that has become the practice.  The practice is we do not discuss individual cases.  My view is that we do not have to accept this practice, the practice needs to change and we need a more candid approach.  If some is<i>sub judice<\/i>, that is a different matter.  That applies to all committees.  The question is, was the Prison Service told, as it should have been, that we would be discussing this?  As a matter of basic professionalism, the Secretary General should have come in shouting from the rooftops that it was aware that we were central to a case in which it was found guilty and which it was appealing and the reason it was appealing the decision, because this committee would be entitled to know that.<\/p><p>On the issue relating to other committees, this is the only constitutional committee of the State and it does trump every other committee.<\/p><p>The reality is that we are entitled to talk to any Department or agency that spends public money and is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

They were getting an awful lot of money from the State and we were entitled to quiz them.  It can be a bash to the ego.

There is some uncertainty around it at the moment.  It is unclear what exactly was specified on the invite but the committee secretariat will revert on that in the coming days.  In terms of what we do then, if members want the committee to correspond with the Secretary General of the Department or the head of the Irish Prison Service to express their dissatisfaction with what took place at the meeting, that can be done and we can seek to have them before us again.

I believe that it is an over-the-top interpretation and that it went in the wrong direction.  It is missing the point altogether.  We need to see where we stand legally on that.

That is likely to be a very strong feature of the accounts for this year, which we will look at next year, given that so much had to be bought very quickly.  Would the Comptroller and Auditor General be looking, for example, for the risk analysis?

I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. Laura Bambrick.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has widely exposed the failings in how we protect workers' incomes when an interruption to earnings occurs, the lack of statutory sick pay being one of the most glaring examples.  Almost all of the EU 27 member states require employers to provide a minimum period of sick pay to their workers.  With the exception of those covered by a sectoral employment order or employment regulation order, workers in Ireland have no legal right to sick pay.  Sick pay is at the employer's discretion in a contract of employment.  As a result, hundreds of thousands of workers, mainly in the private sector, including many essential workers, are not covered for sick pay.  They face being forced out of financial necessity to continue to work unwell or to rely on social protection.  Illness benefit is onerous to access and inadequate for most workers' needs.<\/p> <p>  The trade union movement has long recognised that our voluntary sick pay provision is not working.  However, it took a pandemic to bring the long-standing flaws in the current arrangement to wider attention, in particular clusters among meat plant workers denied paid sick leave by highly profitable employers.  On foot of our calls for legislation to make sick pay mandatory, significant public and political attention followed.  The Government has committed to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme by the end of 2021.  In our submission to the public consultation, a draft copy of which we have provided to the committee for consideration, we set out our recommendations on key design and operational features which must be included in any new scheme.  In the short time I have available for my opening comments, I will focus on the most fundamental consideration to be decided on.  This is how the cost of statutory sick pay is to be shared between employers and the State.<\/p> <p>  It is commonplace in European statutory sick pay schemes for employers to be responsible for the continued payment of the worker's wage, in full or in part, for a minimum period of absence due to sickness or injury.  In the group of high-income European countries, of which Ireland is a member, the duration of statutory sick pay ranges from two weeks to two years.  Typically, it replaces all or nearly all of the worker's wage.  If the sickness lasts longer than the statutory sick pay entitlement, a social benefit is then paid by the state from social insurance contributions.  Financial measures are in place to support businesses in meeting the cost and for cases where there is a genuine inability to pay.<\/p> <p>  Our unusual practice of social insurance funding sick pay from the outset exposes the Exchequer to greater liabilities than those countries with a statutory scheme.  Department of Social Protection officials estimate each week of employer-funded statutory sick pay would reduce the draw on the Social Insurance Fund by &euro;35 million.  This money could instead be funding other social benefits for workers.  At the same time as employers shift responsibility for paying their sick workers exclusively onto the Social Insurance Fund, their contributions into the fund are markedly below employer's contributions in wealthy western European countries.  Raising employer taxes, including social contributions, to comparator averages would have collected nearly &euro;9 billion in additional receipts at average tax levels in 2018.  ICTU recommends that the new statutory sick pay scheme should follow the EU practice of employers paying for an initial period of absence followed by benefits paid from the Social Insurance Fund for the duration of sick pay where appropriate.<\/p> <p>  ICTU does not underestimate the scale of the economic fallout from Covid-19 and is acutely conscious of the significant challenges facing some businesses.  We view the proposed gradual introduction of the scheme, starting with a modest scheme that is improved on over time, as warranted in principle.  Nonetheless, the pace of the introduction of the full scheme should not be unduly prolonged, as businesses with a genuine inability to pay can be supported in meeting their obligations through financial measures.<\/p> <p>  Finally, having convinced Government of the necessity to introduce statutory sick pay, the priority for ICTU is now to deliver a fit-for-purpose scheme.  We favour a scheme which does not serve to displace current collectively agreed sick pay schemes, which will improve working conditions and protect workers' health and incomes, which will replace the current voluntary approach to sick pay with a statutory obligation on employers to provide a minimum period of sick paid leave, and which will bring workers' basic entitlements into line with European norms.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for its attention, and we are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Ms King and invite Mr. McDonnell to make his brief opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We understand the desire of the Department and the members to extend to workers the availability of a statutory sick pay scheme.  The then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection paid out &euro;13.64 million in illness benefit to 49,000 people in 2019, an average of &euro;276 per person.  However, we note the equivalent in the public service on the basis of a 4.2% sickness rate in 2019 cost &euro;381 million.  Any system of statutory sick pay that relaxes the rules currently applied to illness benefit would result in a far higher cost for statutory sick pay.  Presumably, it is the intention of the House that employers bear this cost.  Sick pay is a material cost for many small businesses, especially those that have to hire temporary replacement labour.<\/p> <p>  There are public comparisons being made in this consultation to rates of sickness benefit being paid in other EU countries where social contribution rates are far higher.  If we want higher personal benefits, we must be willing to pay for them via employee PRSI.  We also acknowledge that our social insurance system is not social insurance in the terms meant by our EU neighbours.  Employer and employee contributions, which used to be capped, are no longer.  However, benefits are capped. This is not how true social insurance systems function.  This is how tax systems function.  <\/p> <p>  Workers earning less than &euro;18,304 make no contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  They make a payment of &euro;185.90 as a universal social charge, USC, which some people wish to get rid of.  Many part-time workers fall into this category.  We think it is valid to ask workers who want to avail of social security benefits to make a small contribution to them.  This means we must socialise those costs elsewhere.  If we are going to have a conversation about social insurance entitlements, we need to have an adult conversation about how we fund them.  Putting the burden on employers will simply increase the cost of labour with knock-on implications for annual incomes.  <\/p> <p>  We spend &euro;3.5 billion annually on the pay as you earn, PAYE, tax credit.  Should we revise this?  While Ireland is already heavily and overly dependent on income tax, Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, has previously proposed, and does so again this morning, a solidarity tax of 3% on all PAYE incomes over &euro;100,000.  This would bring PAYE workers in line with high earning self-employed persons, and it would generate &euro;314 million per annum.  Whatever way we choose to fund statutory sick pay, let us not make it a burden on employers, and let us not borrow more money to fund it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I now invited members to discuss the issue with witnesses.

We are well aware that for some businesses, the cost of labour is a decimal percentage of the cost of sales.  Let us be honest; there are some highly profitable mostly multinational companies working in this country for which this does not present an issue.<\/p> <p>  On the other hand, there are small businesses in the service sector where the cost of labour can be north of 50%.  The National Competitiveness Council puts it at 86% in some businesses.  I refer to what one is faced with when someone who is entitled to statutory sick pay is in a small business.  I acknowledge we are having a discussion in the abstract about what percentage of daily or weekly pay that is.  In a small business, if one takes, for example, somewhere where the service has to be delivered by a person physically being there, such as a hairdresser, a barber, security function, coffee shop and what not, one is not merely looking at the statutory sick pay but also the replacement cost of labour.  In businesses which are marginally profitable, that is a significant cost, which potentially makes the delivery of that service on that day loss-making.  <\/p> <p>  We are not suggesting there are businesses that could not pay an element of statutory sick pay.  The worst-case scenario would be an inability-to-pay clause but the reality of some of those European countries that have been quoted earlier is that they have significant rates of employee social insurance - up to 20% in the case of France - so these things have to be paid for somewhere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>In the event that an employer cannot pay, it is surely reasonable that there would be a cannot-pay clause.

Mr. McDonnell made reference in his submission to the perceived lack of contribution by those who earn less than &euro;18,000 a year.  It is pretty obvious those people are not earning enough to be able to make a substantial contribution but the notion that there is a mechanism for employers to be able to assess their own capacity and have their capacity to pay assessed is very important.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms King and it relates to the waiting days.  Can she outline the impact of this for members?  It is pretty clear that if a person is unwell but goes to work because he or she is driven there by his or her financial circumstances, that is not good for anybody.  It is not good for the person him or herself and it is most definitely not good for the people with whom that person is working.  Replacement costs have been talked about but the replacement costs of one person can escalate into replacement costs for multiple persons in the event of somebody going to work when he or she is not well.

I took part in all of the discussions with Government officials in respect of all of this when the pandemic first occurred.  The Deputy will be aware that it adjusted the six waiting days that were in place and so on and so forth.  The collectively bargained agreements contain a variety of provisions with regard to waiting days.  The Deputy will be well aware of the provisions, for instance, in the public sector sick pay agreements and so on, where it just does not occur, full stop.  If people become eligible to receive payment for illness, then they go into that scheme and that is how there are paid for the duration of the illness.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view, ideally there should be no waiting days.  When people are ill, they have to have income.  One clear issue arising in the pandemic was that people were going to work when they were unwell because they could not afford to stay at home and waiting days were a contributory factor.  That is the reality.  As waiting days mean that someone will receive no income, when a person is on very low wages and every cent counts it can therefore have quite disastrous effects.<\/p><p>From our point of view in the consultation, we are trying to get the point across that illness benefit should cover the illness because the illness does not wait for a day, two days or three days.  From that point of view, the illness benefit should do what it needs to do which is cover the worker for the period he or she is out sick.  On some occasions there will be some differences.  Currently the system is quite onerous if one talks about State payments.<\/p><p> One of the benefits of an employer having an obligation is that whatever we agree at the end of this, the employer will continue to pay for a period.  In other words, the issue of waiting should no longer be appropriate or should not even arise, quite candidly, if we get into that scenario.  If we take a person on maternity leave, for example, the day that person goes on maternity leave she gains the benefit of the maternity leave.  In many cases, as the Deputy will know well because she negotiated many of them, workers have top ups from employers.  They also apply from day one and then the State payment kicks in, so there are a whole variety of ways and means to do this.  That comes into play in the construction sector where sick pay is on a daily basis.<\/p><p> We are in a public consultation process and hopefully we are going to be engaging in many discussions under the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, system with the Department on what the final outcome of this will be.  From a starting point, the illness benefit should do what it is meant to do.  The employer has an obligation and a break in wages should not occur if that obligation is met.  That is our point of view on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We learned a lesson from when the sick pay scheme in the public service was slashed.

They have both made valid points that the committee needs to try to understand as it tries to shape this.<\/p> <p>  From ICTU's point of view, where there are collective agreements around sick pay, is there a rule of thumb around how the cost is shared in contributions between the employee and the employer?  Would that be any guide to this issue of how we should try to divide up the relative costs?  In a sick pay scheme, the State will be a significant player as well.<\/p> <p>  Things are changing in terms of the responsibilities of enterprise.  The more volatile nature of employment and the need to invest more in staff means that employers will take on more responsibility for training and for illness arrangements.  From ISME's point of view, have SMEs learned any lessons from the Covid-19 period?  I know Mr. McDonnell talked about the cost of absences but a sick person with Covid-19 coming into the workplace would be a disaster for the workplace.  There has been clear merit in having some arrangements so that people feel confident staying at home.

Is it the duration or the waiting times, etc.?  That is apart from the issue of the cost.  Mr. McDonnell raised the valid issue of the replacement of absent staff being a cost.  It is a cost that we need to think about in terms of the design of a scheme.

By and large, collective agreements usually cover a certain number of weeks.  There is no real provision for a contribution in most of the collective agreements but I would give an example of another collective agreement that does.  For instance, in construction there is a small contribution from workers every week on an ongoing basis.  It is something in the order of cents that is paid into a fund, which then pays out for sick pay, in the order of about &euro;44 per day for someone who is sick.  Most of the collectively bargained agreements would include the provision, much like the maternity leave system, that when State payments kick in, they are refunded back to the employer.  That would be the same in the public sector as well.<\/p> <p>  We are strongly arguing that sick pay paid by the employer should be a condition of employment.  A strong argument has been put forward about labour costs and the increase in same and so on.  I fundamentally disagree with the argument made by employers because if one goes into business, a company cannot go to the ESB and ask for a lesser price for electricity because it is small, for example.  If one goes into business one should be able to counter and deal with the cost of a decent wage and decent terms and conditions.<\/p> <p>  From our point of view, we pay a big bill in this State for the privilege of low pay.  One in four workers in this country is low-paid.  It cost the State just under &euro;1 billion in 2018 to supplement the income of low-paid workers to try to keep them out of the worst levels of deprivation.  That is the price of low pay to this Government and State.  The answer of employers to this is that either the worker should pay through extra tax or PRSI, or the State should pay more money to the employer to put this condition in place.  We fundamentally reject that.  Workers going to work and giving of their labour should be given a decent rate of pay and should have decent conditions.  We regard sick pay as a decent condition of employment and it should be paid for by the employer.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McDonnell is right about having an adult conversation.  That is the piece of the adult conversation we should have.  When one looks across Europe, they have much higher employer contributions for social insurance but their social wage benefits to workers are much better and those states do not have the large level of bill that this country has to uphold employers paying low wages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I will follow up on some of the questions the Deputy asked me.  One of the stand-out lessons from Covid-19 goes back to the philosophy of sickness and unemployment benefits as a charge on the social welfare system.  We saw that when the temporary wage supplement scheme was introduced at the start of the pandemic, the payment to workers making more than &euro;76,000 per year through the system was &euro;0.  We should contrast that with countries in continental Europe.  For instance, if someone loses one's job in Denmark, the payment can temporarily be up to 80% of one's salary.  That tapers down to a national basic payment but the principle is that caps on salaries were removed a number of years ago.  The benefits are capped, however, and that is fundamentally unfair.  That is one of the lessons we learned.<\/p> <p>   I will give an example of the high wage costs for businesses.  We represent many people in the personal grooming sector.  The UK has brought in an element of statutory sick pay and in some hair salons in the UK that has meant that salon owners have moved away from employment and what they are doing now is renting the chair.  The outcome of that, which I am sure ICTU would not like to see happening either, is that people who were previously employees are forced to become contractors, generating their own charges for their services and then renting the fixed assets from a salon owner.  That is an example of what is happening on the ground and what those in the grooming industry brought to my attention when I shared this proposal.<\/p><p>In terms of waiting days, there is one element that plays against that.  In the scheme of the management of a statutory sick pay scheme, currently one has a State payment made after day six.  To understand the impact of waiting days and so forth, in the case of a person who is on a daily rate of pay of X per day, what percentage of X would be represented by sick pay and what percentage of that could be recovered from the State that is currently covered by the illness benefit scheme?  Unless we can see meat on the bone in the proposals, it would be difficult for us to deal with issues such as that.<\/p><p> ICTU has actively advertised the benefit of the scheme in the Netherlands, which is up to two years.  Employees who avail of that are put into quite an intrusive return to work and health recovery protocol, which some people might not like.  Second, SMEs can avail of insurance.  The State insures and underwrites the cost of that for them.  It is not an inability to pay.  It is more a question of how one does that.  Does an employer tell the State that he cannot afford to give two weeks' sick pay to that person?  Do we just simply adopt an insurance measure that would be far more practical and sensible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>We certainly do not want people to feel that they have to go to work when they are sick for all kinds of reasons such as lack of pay, loyalty to the company or whatever else.  The other side of that coin is that we do not want people abusing the system by taking so-called sick days either.  There are two sides of the coin and it needs to be balanced.<\/p> <p>  I am struck by how some of the large companies deal with this.  Diageo, for example, offers 26 weeks' paid maternity and paternity leave to its employees.  Other large companies offer significant perks.  This idea of looking after one's employees is important.  Many employers are beginning to realise that to retain talent, they have to look after employees very well.

From my experience on the Low Pay Commission, it is interesting that since 2000, 20 years on, not one claim has ever gone before the Labour Court where an employer was unable to pay.  There is a reason for that.  The provisions of the Act state that an employer must prove he cannot pay.  In other words, the employer must open his books.

They know very well that paying a decent wage and offering good conditions is the manner in which they will retain their employees and that they will get a much better return for the company as well.  That is tried and trusted.<\/p><p>It is now accepted by all of the major bodies that that is a fact of life.  I do not think it would be an easy job to reconcile our position in regard to this, which is that decent work includes a decent rate of pay.  People cannot live on the minimum wage.  It is about &euro;2.20 per hour below the living wage.<\/p><p> Terms and conditions of employment are a matter between workers and employers in the first instance.  Therefore, the obligation on employers to provide sick pay for their employees is a term and condition of employment.  Somebody in business has that judgment to make about affordability and having proper wages and conditions.  Those are very serious considerations that an employer has to make when he or she undertakes to employ people.  The very strongly advocated view from the employer side for years has been that they pay wages but other social matters such as pensions and sick pay are not a matter for them, they are a matter for the State.<\/p><p> Mr. McDonnell asked earlier what the Social Insurance Fund is for.  I can tell him that one of the primary uses of money from the Social Insurance Fund is the provision of a State pension.  Some 70% of the fund is used to provide a State pension to people because they have no other access to a pension and would be in total poverty if there was not a proper State pension in this country.  Those are some of the pieces that also come from the Social Insurance Fund.  I do not know why Mr. McDonnell is questioning what the Social Insurance Fund is for.  It is going to be in deficit.  There is not any doubt about that.  That is the reason we welcome the very good debate that we hope will happen.  I agree with Mr. McDonnell that we will have an adult debate about how sick pay should be funded, but we are fundamental in our view that it is an obligation of the employer to pay sick pay to an employee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020121600002#F02800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patricia King","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank ISME and ICTU for their presentations.  I apologise if some of my questions have already been asked.  Unfortunately, I was delayed at another event.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. McDonnell and ISME.  I very much welcome the fact that ISME supports the call for the statutory right to sick pay in this country.  That is progress, but I am not sure that the demand that employers pay nothing towards it stands up to scrutiny.  I am struck that his predecessors would have made the very same argument against paid annual leave 70 or 80 years ago, before we had a right to paid annual leave in this country.  My understanding is that there are three types of employers.  There are employers who can afford to pay sick pay, and do.  There are employers who can afford to pay sick pay and choose not to.  Then there is a cohort of employers who are just about getting themselves back up on their feet at the moment and are obviously struggling to make ends meet.<\/p> <p>  What research has been undertaken by ISME on the affordability issue?  Mr. McDonnell talks about the costs to an employer from a statutory right to sick pay.  What share of firms would require temporary replacement cover if a person falls ill?  In some organisations two people have to do the job of three people if somebody is out sick.  In other firms, that is simply not possible.  What share of his membership require temporary replacement cover?  Of the member organisations of ISME, what is the average number of sick days among their workforce on an annual basis?  Does he have any idea of that?  We need to understand what is going on within his representative body in order to take his concerns seriously.

If an employee's entitlement to annual leave is X number of days per annum, that becomes a structured, costed part of his or her remuneration.  Any entitlement to statutory sick pay would have to be treated in the same way if a company was not to go bust, especially those that are more labour dependent.<\/p> <p>  Not being in receipt of any State moneys, I am afraid we are not in a position to survey membership about how many sick days employees take per annum.  We are one of the very few associations one will talk to here that is not in receipt of direct State subvention, so we do not have the resources to do that.  I would love to do it, if the Houses wish to resource me to do it, but I am not in a position to do it.<\/p> <p>  As to those entities where replacement is a necessity, that is very much a sectoral question, but I will give a broad answer.  Typically, people in an office environment are not replaced when they go sick.  In a lot of service entities, staff who are sick must be replaced because the service is sold at point of delivery, so if a cleaner, a security person or a hairdresser does not show up then one cannot deliver the service and therefore there is no turnover.  In those types of service industries, replacement is typically 100% and then there are other areas where it is mixed.  In construction, if one of a number of bricklayers on a site is missing then the work slows down for the day, but if the crane operator is missing then the crane does not work unless a replacement worker is found.

I accept that.  We have to remember that our cost of labour, our national minimum wage, is driven by two factors.  The first is the costs of goods and services, and business charges, which we know are high.  The second is the size of the social wage, which is very low in Ireland.  The social wage is the cost of education, healthcare and public transport.  The reason it is so low is that we spend, on average, approximately &euro;3,500 less per person than comparative EU countries.  The reason for that is that our intake from employer social insurance is comparatively low.  If we do not take in more in employer's social insurance contributions to fund the social wage, the cost of wages is driven up.  The cost is being paid, one way or the other.  Investing more in the social wage will keep us competitive and introducing statutory sick pay is not lose-lose for business.<\/p> <p>  I am not responding in particular to what the Deputy just mentioned but we have heard a lot about absenteeism, moral hazards and how to ensure that people are not abusing the system.  It is one of the great paradoxes that the more generous statutory sick pay is, either in terms of replacement rates or in the low number of waiting days, the lower the level of absenteeism.  That might sound counter-intuitive but the reason is that if people get the opportunity to get themselves better when they have a small ailment, it stops the sickness or illness from festering and becoming a bigger health issue, thus necessitating more time off.  <\/p> <p>  As I mentioned in my earlier contribution, statutory sick pay is normal practice across our European partners, including Northern Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p>They also have small businesses.

The report builds on previous work carried out by the Irish Maritime Development Office in the area and it updates the land bridge study, which was delivered in 2018.<\/p> <p>  The report takes account of important issues, including, but not limited to, market conditions, including trade and tourism volumes, capacity and utilisation of maritime transport services, and emerging trends that may influence demand and supply conditions in the future.  The report considers the desirability of State intervention in the shipping industry, taking into account lessons learned in dealing with this question over the past two years.  The report also takes account of recent industry consultations and emerging national and international influences.  The report concludes by updating previous advice and making a series of recommendations, laying particular emphasis on a contingency approach that recognises the complexity and uncertainty of current circumstances and the value of scenario planning in preparing for the unexpected.  The recommendations we make are cautious and prudent, cognisant of the important and serious implications for the national economy and vulnerable sectors within it of failing to protect maritime connectivity.<\/p> <p>  I will deal with some key points in the report.<\/p><p>I will outline the structure of the presentation.  The presentation gives an overview of freight volumes through Irish ports.  It then focuses on roll-on-roll-off, ro-ro, and lift-on-lift-off, lo-lo, traffic or on a combined basis unitised traffic, which are really the areas of concern when it comes to Brexit and Covid-related challenges.  We look at demand and supply factors and discuss the case for State intervention in the shipping market.  I will conclude with summaries and recommendations from the report and inform the committee about a communications campaign that has been running to alert the market to the necessary preparations for Brexit it should be undertaking.  <br\/><br\/>The graph in front of members tracks volumes through Irish ports over the past 13 years.  It relies on the iShip index, which is an aggregate measure of volumes through Irish ports.  The graph is set at 650 so, in many respects, what members see on the screen amplifies the effect but it will give members a clear understanding of how volumes have moved over the course of the past two years in particular.  Members can see that there has been a tapering off in ro-ro volumes, particularly as we came into 2020 and Covid had its effects.  As volumes are at that level, and members can see at previous points on the graph that they were often much higher in Irish ports in the past, there is sufficient capacity in Irish ports to handle forecast volumes.  This gives a more detailed monthly analysis of ro-ro volumes, which is an area of particular interest when it comes to discussing Brexit and land bridge implications.  What members see in this slide is a comparison between 2019 and 2020 monthly carryings through Irish ports.  The blue bar represents 2020.  From the beginning of the year, volumes were running behind last year's levels.  When Covid started to take effect as we went into March, April and May, volumes fell very significantly.  There were points when ro-ro volumes on some services and in some ports were 35% to 40% behind last year's levels.  The decline was not evenly distributed across all ports and all services.  Some services suffered to a greater extent than others.<br\/><br\/>As we moved through the year, particularly in July, September and November, we can see that volumes exceeded last year's levels.  In July, we were coming out of a lockdown period where demand was suppressed because of the restrictions.  As these eased, volumes increased.  In November, it was noteworthy that volumes were significantly ahead of last year's levels.  This is important because our view is that those volumes contain a significant amount of traffic that is building stockpiles in Ireland in preparation for the effects of Brexit.  This is a phenomenon we have seen in previous deadlines as the effects of Brexit came into play and the market took steps to mitigate those risks.  <br\/><br\/>In this slide, members will see the effects of Covid-19 on the passenger business through Irish ports.  They can see that in quarter 2, volumes in the Republic of Ireland were down by 91% while in Northern Ireland, they were down by 83%.  For the island as a whole, volumes were down by 88%.  This phenomenon of suppressed passenger demand and reduced numbers of cars travelling, particularly on ro-ro services, frees up space on those services for freight.  As we head into 2021, our expectation is that passenger volumes will remain suppressed and the space made available because of the absence of passenger cars will contribute to the response of the shipping industry in respect of services with increased volumes of freight were that to occur.  <br\/><br\/>I will discuss some of the demand characteristics of the market.  This slide deals with economic and seasonality effects and some of the effects of stockpiling.  As we head into 2021, economic forecasts suggest a slowing down in the Irish economy.  This will reduce freight volumes.  As we move through this stockpiling period and enter quarter 1 of 2021, the likelihood is that volumes will be reduced as we eat into those stockpiles and those stockpiles are used to meet demand.  In any event, volumes are generally down on peak demand in January of each year - sometimes by as much as 20%.  This occurs routinely for seasonal reasons.  <br\/><br\/>On the supply side, it is interesting to note that there has been significant investment in the market over the course of the past number of years.  Notable among those investments were Irish Ferries' investment in the <i>MV W.B. Yeats<\/i>while CldN made investments like the <i>Selene<\/i>.  These represent very significant increases in capacity.  These vessels were launched on the market as Brexit-busting vessels that offered significant additional capacity when needed on direct services to the Continent.<br\/><br\/>Overall, in the course of the past year, we have seen significant additions to capacity.  Up to this point, six new services have commenced.  Members will see on the screen that eight more services are planned for 2021.  These are either new services or expansions of existing services.  This represents a significant response from the market.  Looking at the route map that outlines the services that are available, members can see the services outlined on the map here representing four different shipping companies and eight different services.  This does not take account of the services that are planned to commence early in 2021.  <br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that lo-lo capacity also makes a significant contribution on an annual basis.  In 2019, more than 1 million 20 ft. equivalent units, TEUs, were moved between Irish ports and continental ports.  The lo-lo industry is notable because it uses vessels that are not as specialised as those operating in the ro-ro market so there is greater availability.  Operators have the ability to increase size.  Given the prevalence of chartering in the lo-lo market, vessels can be off hire and new vessels can be taken on.  Lo-lo has been shown to be a viable alternative to the land bridge with appropriate supply chain adjustments.  That is something to which I will return as we look at other services because there are substitutes but the substitutes that work in terms of accommodating land bridge business require supply chain services for them to work effectively.  On the lo-lo side, members can see the route map.  There are nine different companies offering 23 different services.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand the structure of the shipping market in Ireland.  There are relatively low barriers to entry so it is open to new entrants.  The market is served by a number of large high-quality providers - leading shipping companies in Europe and the rest of the world.  The industry is capital-intensive so the participants in the industry have some costs creating an imperative to generate revenues to meet those costs so the industry will follow demand.<\/p><p>The industry and the market are highly competitive.  There is a history of investment to retain and grow market share.  I have referenced some of the investments in the recent past, and they are ongoing.  The industry has a history of good service and meeting market needs, and it has responded commendably in meeting Covid challenges and demonstrating its resilience.  Our shipping services and port companies have kept going, and they are to be commended for this.<\/p><p> The market structure supports the view that the industry will respond to changes in demand based on commercial imperatives.  On the supply side, the big question, and what is not entirely clear, is the extent to which the land bridge will continue to function.  Undoubtedly, there will be delays and disruptions at UK ports, and we are taking that as a sensible working assumption and advising importers and exporters accordingly.  In the communications campaign we have been running for the last two months, we have been highlighting this and asking importers and exporters to take appropriate steps.  However, the Dover-Calais route and, indeed, the services provided through the Channel Tunnel, are important trading arteries for the UK.  The shipping industry believes that Dover-Calais and the Channel Tunnel will overcome the problems and will continue to provide services, notwithstanding its acceptance of difficulties on 1 January, as the users of the system develop an understanding of the new circumstances.  It is not in the UK's interest for Dover-Calais to fail and it is in its rational self-interest to do everything possible to ensure that it works.<\/p><p> Demand for land bridge services is relatively inelastic, and this is a conclusion we reached in the land bridge report.  Even with some increases in cost and time, there was still significant demand for land bridge services.  We tested this out in regard to delays of up to 12 hours, although beyond that it definitely becomes more difficult to see the extent to which the land bridge will continue to be used.  Nonetheless, inelasticity has been tested out to 12 hours.  Land bridge traffic existed before the Single Market and with customs controls, and I am old enough to remember that.  In those circumstances, it did provide a competitive option for importers and exporters.  We are cautioning, however, that some sectors are heavily reliant on the superior speed of the land bridge, and as the alternatives are not capable of delivering the speed or the flexibility of the land bridge, this means that alterations to supply chains are necessary under those circumstances to make the alternatives work.<\/p><p> On the supply side, we tested our assumptions through consultation with the industry, and those consultations have been ongoing over the course of the last nine months.  What we have found is that there is surplus capacity on all routes and there is a desire in the industry to meet emerging demand, which I described earlier as a commercial imperative.  There is some support for a collaborative approach.  We recommended in the report that we should test the extent to which participants in the industry can collaborate to provide greater coverage and greater frequency for users, and this met with some success in that there have been some announcements in regard to ferry companies operating on different days of the week to provide greater coverage.<\/p><p> We are operating in a benign charter market, so if additional capacity needs to be brought in, it is available in a reasonable time period.  When we look at response times, which are dealt with in the table on the right-hand side, we can see four levels of response.  First, the industry indicates that it has surplus capacity which is available immediately.  Second, it indicates it can alter schedules to provide additional capacity and that is possible within a one-day to three-day time period.  Third, it can redeploy vessels within the respective fleets, which can take up to a week.  Fourth, it can charter in, and that process can take between two weeks and a month, depending on the circumstances in the market, the availability of suitable vessels and so on.<\/p><p> Turning to the case for State intervention, particularly in light of recent developments, we are asking is there a need for State intervention, and if there were a need, what would it look like.  Our understanding is that it would require the State to go to the industry to provide the capacity that is needed, and that it is the self-same industry that is indicating clearly that it will respond in its own way and is capable of doing so.  There is no evidence of market failure at the moment, and we have seen that through the variety of different responses that I have outlined.  If there were to be intervention, there is a risk of market distortion and a risk of doing lasting damage as a result.  There is a risk of breaching state aid guidelines and a risk of legal challenges, such as those that occurred in the UK when an attempt was made to intervene in the market.  The evidence supports the view that the market will respond as I have outlined.  The shipping industry is opposed to State intervention and the response of the shipping industry is demonstrably good, so the conclusion is that the case for State intervention has not been made successfully at this time.  We fully acknowledge that, in extreme circumstances, State intervention may be required but our contention is it is not required at this time.<\/p><p> In summary, freight demand in January will be lower than normal because of economic considerations, because of the stockpiling that is currently ongoing and because of seasonal factors.  Supply of capacity will be higher than normal because of the interventions in the market by the industry that I have mentioned, both from incumbents and from new entrants.  The evidence shows there is surplus capacity on all routes.  The market will be motivated to respond to emerging demand because of the structural issues in the market that I have outlined.  State intervention is problematic.  Holding out the prospect of State intervention in a functioning market is also potentially damaging because it creates an expectation and it can delay the spontaneous response of the market.  However, importers and exporters must &ldquo;ACT now&rdquo;, and this &ldquo;ACT now&rdquo; phrase is an acronym for &ldquo;assess, communicate and trial&rdquo;, which has been part of an ongoing press and radio campaign that has been running for the last couple of months.  We are asking importers and exporters to assess their current arrangements in order to be sure they will work as we go forward, to look at the alternatives and to assess those as well, to communicate their requirements to shipping companies so the steps that shipping companies are capable of making can be taken in advance, and to trial the alternatives and not leave that to 1 January.<\/p><p> To conclude, the recommendations in the report are that State intervention is not required and that we should maximise industry collaboration to overcome the challenges we face.  That is a process that is ongoing and is part of the consultations we have been having and continue to have with industry.  There should be scenario and contingency planning.  That process is ongoing and we are involved regularly with the Department, teasing out different scenarios and planning for the unexpected to the extent that is possible.  We have looked for a commitment from the shipping industry, and we have taken a different direction on this than in the UK.  A capacity framework was put in place with the Department of Transport and we have gone directly to industry and asked it to prioritise vital supplies, such as medicines.  The response was very favourable and a protocol has been put in place that will give access to officials from the Department of Health to shipping companies if there is a difficulty, and shipping companies have agreed to prioritise the response.  We recommended a communications campaign and I have outlined that this is already ongoing.<\/p><p>We have recommended that we closely monitor developments in other member states and in related industries, such as aviation, to ensure that developments there do not place the maritime industry at a disadvantage.  We have recommended that measures taken in those industries, and in other member states, should be applied in Ireland if and when they are applicable and beneficial here.  We also recommend that there will be ongoing monitoring of market conditions.  Such monitoring has been a feature for at least the last two years as we prepared for Brexit and when the Covid pandemic took an effect at the beginning of this year.  We now operate a weekly monitor and update the Department with that information each week.  We consult regularly and that was weekly with industry, shipping companies and ports.  As many of the problems that we faced have been resolved, the meeting schedule has been extended so we now meet as required.  Suffice to say, the monitoring of the market and our engagement with the Department on that issue has never been more intense.  By way of information, I hold aloft the flyer that is being used to encourage importers and exporters to act now and take the necessary steps for assessing, communicating and trialling.  That concludes my presentation and I am happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey for his presentation.

It would be helpful if we could have the Powerpoint presentation as it would make our follow-up work a lot easier.  The movement of goods has been an issue since long before the referendum because people identified the need to focus on Ireland's direct shipping links with our biggest market that is continental Europe.  A move away from the land bridge is something that would have always needed to worked on even if there was no Brexit.<\/p> <p>  I have questions on issues that were touched on in the presentation but I believe that we should use this time to go into a bit more detail about the issues that small business owners all over the country have conveyed to us as their public representatives.  The delegation has spoken at length that there is sustainable capacity.  Is there really roll-on, roll-off capacity?  I was taken aback by the focus on the idea that space has been freed up due to the decline in the number of tourists.  Is it sustainable to use that space?  Please God, the tourism industry will be back and I know lots of people from the Continent who look forward to returning or coming to Ireland for cycling holidays or whatever.  I would like the witnesses to allay my concern.  <\/p> <p>  When we talk about the importance of roll-on, roll-off services and shipping to the Continent, it is not just about the destination ports.  It is the ability to travel much further inland into new markets, particularly when one thinks of the resources that the Government has put into opening a new Enterprise Ireland office in Frankfurt in Germany.  It would great to have new economic chanceries in all of the EU 27 member states and to really tap into the potential of the continental market but that requires long distance haulage to get goods to market in those places, which is an issue that is tied to the land bridge.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Lacey mentioned in his report, or perhaps I have seen it elsewhere, that there is the potential for delays to last up to 12 hours.  To what extent has the IMDO engaged with the UK port operators such as in Holyhead, Folkestone and Dover?  I ask because last weekend worrying scenes of trial runs were broadcast on television, etc., of Kent and other ports in the UK.  Although the trial runs were the result of the impact of work done in France as opposed to the UK, there have been numerous media reports that the UK is not Brexit ready, particularly when it comes to exports and imports.  The gridlock experienced at Dover, Folkestone or Portsmouth could be far worse than what has been speculated with Brexit.  What is the knock-on effect on Irish exporters that are trying to get their goods to market, some of which must drop their goods at British destinations before continuing into continental Europe?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Lacey has mentioned the outreach that has been done with exporters in terms of encouraging awareness.  I am concerned about the time pressure on fresh food exporters and seafood producers in Galway, for example, who only have a set period of time to get their goods to the fish markets in northern France.  There is potential for a 12-hour delay with the land bridge and we know how long direct ferries take to sail across to France.  What supports have the industry and the IMDO put in place to allay the fears of our exporters?  It is all well and good talking about their need to diversify and consider other options but if either the land bridge or direct shipping is not the answer, then what is left for the exporters?  Anyone who works in the fresh food, time sensitive area must be accommodated.<\/p> <p>  An awareness campaign was mentioned but I do not feel that, which is not a slight on Mr. Lacey.  I have spoken to a lot of industry groups, chambers of commerce, exporters and SMEs and they are up against it in terms of dealing with the pandemic.  We have often talked about Brexit preparedness in general terms.  It is very hard for a small company that produces a niche product and perhaps employs three employees to also have a Brexit officer when its managing director is also the head of sales, head of human resources and maybe even the chief cleaner at times.  They may think that the land bridge is fine at the moment but we all know that the situation will change drastically on 1 January.  We all hope that there is a deal in the next day or two but the situation will change drastically, which has permeated the real discussion.  How can we convince the people who are not in a position to appoint a Brexit preparedness officer that there is merit in direct shipping to their markets?  I know that any exporter will tell anyone that their biggest issue is assuring their client and customer that a product will arrive on time.  That level of reliability and guarantee is so important.  When one considers all of the things like cost, price and standards it is the guarantee and level of importance that matter.  The campaign for direct shipping needs to be backed up and tripled because Brexit is like a lot of things in that it is only until one experiences it that one realises all of the problems.  We cannot ease off on getting prepared come the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#F00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I want to ensure everyone has time to contribute so I ask Mr. Lacey to keep his responses as trimmed as possible yet take as much time as he needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#F00400","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":255,"content":"<p>On the issue of the return of passenger business to ferries and the impact that may have on the capacity of ferries to carry freight, we are very hopeful that there will be a significant return of passenger business because that is the lifeblood of RoPax services but it is somewhat unlikely in the first quarter.  I make that point because it gives us some relief from the problem and the absence of passenger business helps.  It is the desire of the industry and our desire that the passenger business will return as quickly as possible, and sooner rather than later, because it is needed.  As that begins to happen, the industry is capable of responding by introducing more capacity.  I have outlined four different responses by the industry and the introduction of additional capacity is the one that takes the longest time.  That can be done.  As the implications of the return of passenger cars to RoPax vessels and the timeframe become clear we can go back and rely on a response like that from industry.<\/p> <p>  I hope that the Deputy will agree that the response by industry over the last six months and the response that is planned from the beginning of 2021 are very significant indeed and will produce sufficient capacity to meet the needs of diverted land bridge traffic.  <\/p> <p>  What is key is the comparison or substitute ability of other services for the land bridge.  The key issue is that the land bridge is the fastest route to market.<\/p><p>That speed cannot be replicated on other services.  In using other services, it is necessary to accept that compromises will have to be made.  It is necessary to accept that there will be some changes to the supply chain because the speed of the land bridge cannot be provided by those other services.<\/p><p> There is another key ingredient, which is the frequency that is possible using land bridge services.  On the Irish Sea, the services that make up part of the land bridge system are those that operate principally between Dublin and Holyhead and those that operate between Rosslare and Fishguard and Pembroke.  On the Holyhead routes, there are up to eight sailings a day.  On the Rosslare routes, there are four sailings a day.  These 12 sailings give options to land bridge users seven days a week.  We cannot replicate that with direct services to the Continent.<\/p><p> The use of direct services to the Continent will be more concentrated.  There are fewer services.  The total land bridge business is a maximum of 150,000 units per annum.  The total amount of business using roll on-roll off, ro-ro, services to and from Ireland in 2019 was almost 1.2 million.  Therefore, land bridge represents 12% of the total.  It is impossible to produce the frequency for 150,000 vehicles that can be produced for 1.2 million vehicles.  We have to accept that there will be less frequency on direct routes and importers and exporters will have to adjust to that.<\/p><p> I am presenting the facts and what represents the next best alternative to the land bridge.  There are a number of different options, all involving changes to supply chain.  The options are direct routes to the Continent.  With a new entrant from January on Rosslare to Dunkirk, we get a model that is closer to what the land bridge delivers because it is delivering traffic into that part of France.  Dunkirk is only 40 km from Calais.  That is a notable addition.  We have other additional services out of Cork into Zeebrugge, and we have Stena Line announcing an additional vessel in January between Rosslare and Cherbourg.  These are all important developments.<\/p><p> Through those developments, we certainly have sufficient capacity.  We have argued heretofore that sufficient capacity exists in the system because there are other services linking Dublin and Zeebrugge and Dublin and Rotterdam that rely mainly on unaccompanied movement of goods, but they are viable substitutes for the land bridge.  Our call to the market is, if people want to protect their business, they should be aware of all of these options, that perhaps a portfolio approach to the range of services that they use is the most appropriate, and that they use different services as appropriate to protect against difficulties in other services and spread the risk in that way.  Being aware of all of the different options gives choice to importers and exporters and improves frequency.  If the speed of transit is increased, and it will be in using any of those other services, there are changes to supply chains that need to be made.  That could mean developing buffer stocks on the Continent in warehousing, etc., to deal with the demand.<\/p><p> Turning specifically to the question of fast-moving perishable goods, and often high-value goods fall into the same category of needing to move quickly, the land bridge is categorised by the movement of perishable goods, which are often of high value.  There is a difficulty there.  The next best alternative does not overcome the difficulty but there must be changes in the supply chain if we are to overcome those problems.  Therefore, a renegotiation of delivery patterns is absolutely embedded in the choice of any of the other alternatives.  This is possible because we know that those alternatives for lots of different types of traffic are good substitutes.  I accept that there is a problem with traffic.  I mentioned it in my presentation.  That is heavily reliant on the transit time of the land bridge because that cannot be replicated by the alternatives.<\/p><p> I was asked as well whether we are monitoring events in other ports, and we are.  There is contact all the time, through ourselves and through the Department, on how matters are proceeding in other ports that are important to Ireland.  We report on that regularly.<\/p><p> It is concerning that as we head into Brexit, there are trials taking place in UK ports and there is talk of disruption, etc., but to a great extent we expected that to happen.  What is unclear is how long lived that will be and how quickly UK ports will return to normal operations, albeit with the requirement for customs controls and inspections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey.

Mr. Lacey has said that the market is sufficiently flexible.  Obviously, this is something that Mr. Lacey is much more <i>au fait<\/i>with than I am.<\/p><p>Mr. Lacey spoke about the land bridge existing before the Single Market.  I would argue that it is a far more complex world for imports and exports than it was at that time.  Mr. Lacey also stated that there is surplus capacity.<\/p><p>Deputy Richmond and, I am sure, others will deal with how we have heard, from the National Audit Office in Britain, of the absolute lack of preparation.  We have all seen the tailbacks.  We have heard the worries that the Irish Road Haulage Association has.  We also had the port companies before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks in the past while on the idea that there is a traffic management system that involves the port tunnel possibly being used as a slow-moving carpark that trucks just keep driving around until space opens up.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that Mr. Lacey talks about communication with other ports.  Does that mean we could deal with problems, such as the one that has been pointed out to us whereby Calais's IT system was prepared too quickly and does not allow for goods from this State coming through Britain as a land bridge?  That seems like it will be a significant problem and will cause chaos on top of chaos.<\/p><p>In fairness, Mr. Lacey has spoken about a conversation with stakeholders and that there will be a need for adjustments to the supply chain.  I want to know what exactly that has consisted of and who are the stakeholders.  I assume that should be the hauliers, the ports and the ferries, but it also needs to be the business sector.  In fairness, Deputy Richmond spoke about the fact that there are certain goods, particularly fresh food, that needs to be delivered within time.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that there are new ferries for direct delivery, but sometimes the problem with them is the length of time they take.  I would say many businesses involving almost every good operates a just-in-time scenario that is based on the speed of delivery available to them at present, and I am not sure that full preparations have been made.  I want to know what conversations Mr. Lacey has had with all these stakeholders.  I understand we do not know exactly what Brexit we will have but we know it is bad.  Therefore, there will be a considerable operation relating to checks, difficulties, etc.  I want to know what Mr. Lacey's plans are, what consultation has happened, with whom it has happened, what is prepared into the future to ensure we can mitigate whatever we can, and that we have some level of operability with imports and exports across Europe from 1 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#G00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The UK land bridge existed before the Single Market.  I take his point that imports and exports are perhaps a lot more sophisticated now than before.  The technology we have for dealing with customs declarations and so on has also changed.  I would make that point, however, that there is an opportunity to rely on technology to mitigate some of the problems.<\/p> <p>  I cannot comment on the detail of traffic management in ports, especially the traffic management system for the Port Tunnel and Dublin Port.  The Deputy indicated that he had meetings with representatives of the ports and I am sure he has had responses from them on that matter.  I am aware, through engagement with the ports over the past year, that they have been working tirelessly on this problem.  Systems have been put in place, or are in the process of being tested, in Dublin Port and elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  With regard to communications with industry, since the publication of the report under discussion here we have spoken to representative groups, including IBEC, the Irish Exporters Association, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, the medical devices and pharmaceutical industries, and groups that are linked to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including business and innovation, where we took a session with lots of different stakeholders entering the conversation there.  We also had stakeholders enter the conversation in the session we did with the Irish Exporters Association.  That contact has been ongoing.  In our normal work we engage with the groups to discuss these questions and to try to find the best solutions.  On the issue of finding the solutions for individual sectors or individual importers and exporters, I am not sure that we can help to any great extent in communicating with them, but we can direct their communications to the ports and the shipping companies because they are the actors that can make a difference in this scenario.  If importers and exporters are articulating new demands or different requirements, shipping companies are capable of making adjustments to the frequency and capacity of their services, but that conversation needs to take place.  We have been urging that conversation, going back to a forerunner of the Assess, Communicate, Trial, ACT, campaign in 2019 and a campaign called Be Prepared for Brexit, which dealt with all of these issues.  In the room on that occasion we had representatives of industry, importers and exporters.  We were advising the same sort of approach - that one needs the actors who can make a difference to be talking to each other.  We have been urging that.<\/p> <p>  On the timing of deliveries and the sophistication of supply chains, I understand that point fully, but I believe we must accept that if the land bridge is a lot slower and if we have to rely to a greater extent on direct services, then things change.  We cannot replicate the speed of the land bridge using direct services.  There is going to have to be adjustments in the supply chain and just-in-time systems.  Just-in-time systems operate around the conditions that apply in different parts of the supply chain.  If goods cannot be delivered any sooner than two days, is the just-in-time system into which those goods feed capable of adapting?  Those conversations need to take place again.  I hope this addresses the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has a brief supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#H00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":261,"content":"<p>With regard to technology, I am afraid that the solutions are not there.

Perhaps the State intervention should force a proper conversation - perhaps force is the wrong term - around a renegotiation of what will work for businesses, ports, hauliers and ferry companies.  It could be just a case that everybody is waiting until they see what happens, at which point it will be too late.  Any intervention that the IMDO could make to that would be beneficial.

There was a degree of confidence expressed to me about the ability of Calais to respond.  It is important to differentiate between new systems that are being put in place that are going to have teething problems as they are unfolded, and the long-term effectiveness of these systems.  There is no question that on day one there is going to be significant disruption.  I have never seen port development or new systems being introduced that did not cause that problem initially.  With time, practice, and readjustment, and given the necessity to make these things work, we can be more confident that these issues can be resolved than the Deputy is expressing.  It is in the interests of all parties to resolve them.  In the end, if one is introducing barriers to trade, customs inspections, and health inspections and so on then it is going to take longer to progress through a port.  This is a fact that has to be accepted.

The IRHA has taken issue with the report.  I am not going to go into that now because I suspect that there are others here who will do that.  I have two secondary questions in my capacity as a Deputy for Dublin Bay North, which is adjacent to Dublin Port.  The first question was also referred to in earlier contributions, which is the traffic management plan in and around the port.  I believe that Mr. Lacey said he did not want to comment on that and perhaps it is for other agencies, but I am aware that Mr. Eugene Drennan from the IRHA will say later at another Oireachtas committee that we need a new entity to deal with the traffic congestion issue.  Currently there is a traffic management group under the aegis of the Department of Transport, which includes representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of Public Works, the Revenue Commissioners, and the Dublin Port Company.  Does Mr. Lacey have a view on that?  I believe it is too late to set up a single entity.  This problem is on our doorstep.  We need to proceed with the traffic management group that is in place to deal with any problems arising in traffic congestion.  If it is not a matter for the IMDO then that is fine, but perhaps Mr. Lacey will comment on the proposal from the IRHA for a single entity.<\/p><p>This is a secondary question in terms of the overall issue we are dealing with here.  It relates to Dublin Port.  Does the office have a remit for the physical capacity of Dublin Port from the point of view of space and future development?  The residents of Clontarf, whom I represent, have had a very uneasy relationship with Dublin Port, in particular due to the proposal to infill 52 acres of Dublin Bay.  Does the IMDO have a remit for the future development of the ports from the point of view of physical space?<\/p><p> I saw a newspaper article again this week about the possibility of developing Bremore as a port.  I recall the late Deputy, Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, calling for the complete relocation of Dublin Port to Bremore.  I would not have gone that far.  I am interested to know whether the office has a remit in that regard and if the witnesses think the Dublin Port Company has enough space for anticipated future development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#H00600","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Haughey.  Regarding the traffic management plans and their detail, with respect, I am not in a position to answer the question but I have general comments that I am happy to make.  Dublin Port has developed satisfactorily and has met economic needs in the Dublin area, the hinterland around Dublin and the demands of the national economy for many years.  The port has ambitious plans for the future that will take place within the general footprint that is available to Dublin Port at the moment.  Significant efforts have been made at Dublin Port to move non-essential activities outside the port to free up the land in the port for what one might call core trade purposes.  That has been a welcome development.  Overall, we have seen these plans introduced effectively and implemented well within Dublin Port.  The port has been efficient in the way it has gone about those things.<\/p> <p>  These are my observations as an outsider.  I have a degree of trust in Dublin Port that it can deal with traffic management issues and that the people in Dublin Port are best positioned to engage in that activity.  I do not know the detail of Mr. Drennan's proposals on a single entity to deal with the traffic issues in Dublin Port.  Dublin Port and the people in it are very experienced and are and should be highly motivated to resolve this problem.  I think that should be the locus of attention for this problem, but I would welcome the proposals being put forward by Mr. Drennan, insofar as I would be very happy to read them and see exactly what they entail.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the physical capacity of Dublin Port and its future development, a lot of the development in our ports in recent years has been driven by some of the tenets set out in the national ports policy.  The policy has tiered our ports.  We have three tier 1 ports in Dublin, Cork and Shannon-Foynes, two tier 2 ports in Waterford and Rosslare and then ports of regional significance.  The national ports policy has had the effect of generating economies of scale in the tier 1 ports, and has done so very effectively.  Volumes have grown very significantly in the tier 1 ports as a result of that concentration.  In terms of generating efficiencies and economies of scale, I think the national ports policy has been effective.  The policy is going to be reviewed in the next year or so, and that is the appropriate time to look again at the distribution of capacity around the ports in Ireland.  It is encouraging that we have alternatives being put forward by the Port of Drogheda on the Bremore project.  We see significant developments on the drawing board in ports like Rosslare and there are developments under way in the Port of Cork.  As the sustainability agenda takes more of a hold in terms of how maritime transport and road transport happens in Ireland, the importance of regional ports and ports outside of Dublin may very well increase.<\/p> <p>  These are general comments.  The question the Deputy asked requires much more detailed analysis.  I am quite sure that that will be provided for in the review of the national ports policy when it takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey.

Mr. Lacey talks about the fact that we had the land bridge before we had the Single Market.

I do not believe Mr. Lacey engaged with the IRHA in conducting his review.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the ACT campaign launched on foot of this report, every importer and exporter had to go to their logistics provider for a solution.  It was at that stage that the IMDO report was released.  There was very negative engagement on the fact that the report said we had sufficient capacity and that no intervention or extra services were required.  Vehicles were being left behind as direct services left both the week after the report was released and the week before.  They were not able to access direct ro-ro services to mainland Europe.  This contradicts the report and I ask for comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#K00500","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The Deputy has put a number of questions.

The Deputy will have seen the response within the market over the past year.  Our role is to ensure there is a level playing field and that new operators can enter the market and compete <i>pari passu<\/i>with incumbents and that they are at no disadvantage.  The supports we offer obviously do not extend to providing commercial advice or anything like that, but they extend to making information available so that a would-be new entrant to the Irish market can make a judgment as to the prevailing market conditions.  I am not at liberty to comment on the engagement we have all of the time with companies that are interested in establishing in Ireland or in adjusting the services they offer in Ireland because those matters are commercially sensitive and we have to protect that information.  I am not sure what lies behind the Deputy's question but we deal with all comers fairly and honestly.  We create a picture and present information to enable them to evaluate opportunity.

Does Deputy Harkin wish to speak?  No.  That is fine.  As Mr. Lacey will be aware from our previous interaction, I was concerned about the report when it was published.  I was of the view that it was overly complacent with regard to the real pressures that would come on the land bridge in even the best circumstances and with regard to its complete disruption in the worst circumstances.  I was concerned that we had not prepared for that.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  With regard to the recommendations Mr. Lacey has again presented to the committee, other than the communications campaign, the general recommendations basically amount to advice to watch and wait.  We have dealt with various stakeholders with regard to Brexit and there does not seem to be anything proactive in these preparations.  He asserted that we cannot replicate the 12 daily sailings to the UK, but we could replicate quite a number of them and have done so.  Since our previous interaction with the IMDO, the number of scheduled direct sailings from Rosslare Europort has quadrupled.  That indicates that there is significant market demand.  There is also a new player, although it was indicated that the existing players had sufficient capacity.  That is my understanding of the report.  Despite this, DFDS has entered the market with an initial three new vessels that will sail from Rosslare to Dunkirk from 2 January, as Mr. Lacey indicated.  There is obviously demand.  I spoke to representatives of DFDS on the day it launched this new schedule of sailings and the company had received immediate inquiries, including a request from one very big logistics company for four containers on every sailing.  There was obviously very significant unmet demand.  I am glad these new services have come to meet this demand but I am still not convinced there will be sufficient capacity in the event of significant disruption, which may still potentially arise.<\/p> <p>  To move on to my final point, in Mr. Lacey's presentation he said that it is not in the UK's interest for the Dover-Calais route not to work.  That is self-evident but it will not be direct action by the UK authorities that stops the route.  If, as has been indicated today, agreement on fisheries remains a real pressure point, there is at least the potential for French fishermen to disrupt the unloading of British ferries at French ports.  There are real issues that have not, in my judgment, been substantially addressed in the report or in Mr. Lacey's presentation.  I am interested in hearing his comments on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#K00800","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>In the Vice Chairman's opening comments, he used the word \"complacent\".  I do not accept that in any way.  We have been working non-stop on these issues since the commencement of the Brexit problem and even more intensively as deadlines approach.  The final deadline is now approaching.  I assure the Vice Chairman that there has been no complacency.  Our approach has generally been to allow the market to respond and to steer clear of State intervention.  My view is that this is a good approach and that it has produced the results we have seen.  What would the circumstances be like had the State intervened to support a service, an individual operator or a group of operators?  What would the response have been from the industry, which has invested heavily and which is prepared to continue to invest and to respond to market demands?<\/p><p>That would have caused a chaotic response and we could have had grave difficulties.  The spontaneous desire of an industry and of participants in that industry are lost in order to solve the problems of the market in such a scenario.<\/p><p> On being proactive, we have been proactive all of the time in the advice we give to the Department and the Minister and in our engagement with the industry, which has been ongoing over the past two or three years.  There has been a non-stop engagement over that period to try to understand, tease out and address problems.  All of this was compounded by Covid-19 since the beginning of 2020 and that intensified that communication with industry.  There has been no lack of communication with industry, therefore.  Our role is in the maritime industry and we have been engaged in a concerted way with the maritime industry throughout this process.  Through colleagues in the Department, we also have access to a broader range of issues that are involved in the Brexit problem that relate to what is happening with Revenue, clearance procedures and engagements with other agencies and Departments that have concerns and issues.  On all occasions, those issues are processed and we try to find solutions and move on.  That has been part of our work in recent years and it continues to be a significant part of our work.<\/p><p> On the new entrant to the market, I am delighted that has happened and I have expressed my views about that.  The news of this new entrant immediately went up on our website and it was pushed out to the market we serve and the contacts we have.  The new service offers a different solution that brings traffic closer to Calais than previous services have done.  The promoter of the service is working with the assumption that this will capture a significant chunk of land bridge business.  If that is the case, we wish it well.  It has been able to enter the market because there is a level playing field and because it will be able to compete on the same basis as everybody else.  We have tried to ensure that this remains the case.  That has resulted in this new endeavour of the DFDS ro-ro service to Europe coming into the market and as I said, we wish it well.<\/p><p> There is an important issue with the substitutability of some of the services that operate on direct routes to the Continent.  There is a concentration on ro-ro, as if it is the only mode of access to the Continent and as if driver-accompanied solutions to the Continent are the only solution.  It is not because we have seen higher growth in recent years in the use of unaccompanied trailer services to the continent.  That growth has been satisfactory and at a faster rate than ro-ro services and the same is true of lo-lo services.  These alternatives provide solutions and I am not saying this is any partisan way.  I am just laying the information before the committee.  These services work and it is in the interests of Irish importers and exporters to know that these services are there and to evaluate whether these services can make a contribution to them meeting the needs of their customers.<\/p><p> I will go back to the issue of overall capacity.  Capacity is a function of the volume of a vessel and the frequency of sailings.  It is a mathematical equation so it is not an entirely difficult thing to calculate capacity.  When that is matched with demand, the evidence is there as to whether there is surplus capacity and the extent of the surplus capacity.  We have carried out that analysis.  When I spoke about the range of direct services to the Continent, I outlined that there were four different operators at the time of writing and now there are the additional services that we have spoken about.  When one looks at capacity across those services and when one adds in what is planned for January, there is sufficient capacity to carry the land bridge business.  That is an irrefutable fact.  The question remains as to whether the frequency and the points of arrival and departure of those services are sufficient to satisfy the market.  If these new services can do that, they stand a good chance of doing well in attracting land bridge business and if they do not, there are other alternatives.<\/p><p> When one combines these alternatives and when one encourages importers and exporters to be aware of the range of solutions that are available, that is when Irish importers and exporters are most protected.  Putting a portfolio of solutions together with one solution countering the risk of another makes for effective solutions.  That is what we have been encouraging for quite some time, going back to 2019 with the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign, the launch of which at least one member of the committee attended.  I hope that answers some of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lacey for his comprehensive reply.

I am back to the same question of whether the State intervention and the involvement of the Irish Maritime Development Office should have a more proactive and collaborative approach to ensure there is a conversation between the ports, ferries, hauliers and representatives of business, as much as that can be done.  We all accept there will have to be changes and moves but we need to ensure that everybody can get enough out of it and that is accepting that some of these measures will have a cost factor and other factors will be involved.  If we were to listen to the port companies previously, they did not want to get into the conversation but they said that they had engaged with the ferry companies and it suited the ferry companies to operate at the times they operate, which creates difficulties for ports and hauliers in the sense of three or four ferries all arriving at the one time and the gridlock that would cause in a normal time.<\/p><p>If we are talking about 1 January on, it could be absolute bedlam.

If one is stepping outside a known system, namely, the land bridge, that has a transit time of, say, 18 to 20 hours, all the alternatives are slower.  One therefore needs to work around that by renegotiating supply chains and making the necessary adjustments.  To do otherwise would be just to bury one's head in the sand and hope it will be okay.  We are very much of the opinion that importers and exporters need to know the realities, including the realities of the alternatives that are available to them, so they can make those choices.  We have been advocating this for a very long time.<\/p> <p>  In the report a recommendation is made on scenario and contingency planning.  In that process, and with the Department, we have looked at and continue on an ongoing basis to look at what might happen.  If the market does not respond in the way in which we want it to respond, what happens then?  It is entirely unhelpful, in the context of a functioning market, to set out a priority that there will be State intervention because the market is demonstrably capable of doing its job.  I do not say this because of any misunderstanding of how the shipping industry behaves.  I am very familiar with the shipping industry.  I know it is driven by commercial imperatives and not by a sense of altruism.  It will do what is in its interest from a commercial point of view, and it is in the interest of shipping companies to follow demand and to service that demand.  If that demand is not being adequately serviced or if there are superior ways of addressing the demand, new entrants are free to come in.  That very much characterises the response from DFDS.  There is an operator that feels it can provide a better solution than the solutions currently available.  I assume that that is the premise of its business plan, that this will be successful because it will do things better and differently from current operators.  If that is the case, it will succeed.<\/p> <p>  As for the operating times of ferries, and in response to a question from Deputy Verona Murphy earlier, I alluded to a previous career with Irish Continental Group.  With the issue of scheduling and the timing of arrivals and departures, one deals with mobile assets.  These things can be changed, but one changes them in response to market conditions.  It is a particularly difficult thing with ro-pax services, where the interests of both passengers and freight are combined on one single service and there is an attempt to strike a balance that will meet the requirements of both markets.  It is less difficult with freight-only operators, which can attend to the singular requirements of a freight market without having to consider the requirements of a passenger market.  Again, my experience with the market is that the times that deliver most for consumers are the times during which shipping companies operate.  There is no logic in suggesting they would want to do otherwise.  They operate at times when the demand is at its maximum and they satisfy the greatest number of customers, whether freight-only customers or a combination of both freight and passengers.  I hope that helps with Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020121600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Lacey"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I will take a brief supplementary contribution from Deputy Verona Murphy.

This marks the first time I will do so in my role both as Minister of State with special responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance and as a member of the new subgroup on insurance reform under the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment.  It is important to listen to and consider the views of as many key stakeholders as possible.  This committee plays an important role in holding the Government to account in this regard.  Accordingly, I look forward to today's engagement on this issue.<\/p> <p>  Since taking up my appointment in July 2020, I have had a series of meetings with a number of key stakeholders.  These include the chief executive officers, CEOs, of the largest insurance companies in the Irish market, the Alliance for Insurance Reform, the State Claims Agency, Insurance Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Bar Council of Ireland, the Central Bank, Brokers Ireland, Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  I discussed with them the Government's insurance reform agenda and asked them to outline what opportunities and challenges they see at present.  I hope I will hear the committee's views today on the various opportunities and challenges, as all Members of the House have a common interest in moving forward on the insurance agenda.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that much work has taken place in the area of insurance reform over the past four years.  Indeed, in 2016, the committee produced its own report on the cost of motor insurance, which fed into the cost of insurance working group's report in the Department of Finance.  Both the committee and the cost of insurance working group found that there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance.  This position remains true.<\/p> <p>  I will outline progress to date on the cost of insurance working group reforms.  Members will be aware that this group published its last progress report on 30 October 2020.  It showed that the majority of its recommendations were implemented.<\/p><p>These included improved transparency through the introduction of the national claims information database, the implementation of the Personal Injuries Commission recommendation to replace the book of quantum with the new personal injuries guidelines, the strengthening of requirements to co-operate with PIAB and civil liability law changes to make it more difficult to make fraudulent claims.<\/p><p> It has been shown that these reforms have largely stabilised the motor insurance market.  The data from the CSO and EUROSTAT show reductions in the cost of private motor insurance of about one third since 2016.  I would like to recognise the contribution of all sides of the House on this issue.  Without cross-party support, I genuinely believe many of the issues might not have been able to be progressed to the extent that they have.  This is an example of how, when we work closely together, we can make progress.<\/p><p> Nevertheless, more needs to be done.  We are all aware of the stories from businesses, charities, voluntary groups, childcare operators and leisure operators of the increase in public liability insurance.  This includes a series of inconsistent awards levels for injuries.  In some cases, injuries appear to be relatively minor but this inevitably creates difficulties for the businesses, such as cr&egrave;ches and play centres, in securing insurance thereafter.  In addition, data from the national claims information database demonstrates that Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, settlements in recent years continued to decrease.  This is despite it being shown that PIAB represents a much more cost-efficient and time-efficient settlement channel than going through litigation.<\/p><p> Our economy and society need a stable and affordable insurance environment.  The programme for Government recognises this and sets out a range of commitments to reform the insurance sector in Ireland, including reducing the size of personal injury awards, increasing competition through new entrants and enforcement, improving transparency and minimising the need for costly litigation through reforming the system.<\/p><p> It was also recognised that, to address these issues, a whole-of-government approach was needed.  In order to achieve this and to elevate the reform agenda to a group closer to the Cabinet, the Government decided that a subgroup on insurance reform, under the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment, would be the most effective vehicle to drive the implementation of these commitments.  The subgroup was formally established at the end of September and is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and it also includes the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe, Michael McGrath, McEntee and O&rsquo;Gorman, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and myself.<\/p><p> One of the first tasks of the subgroup was to commence progressing a number of key areas of reform and to produce an action plan.  The plan was launched on 8 December by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and myself.  The action plan has generally been well received.  It recognises a number of the key issues where progress is needed in the short term and we anticipate that 97% of these actions will be completed by the end of 2021.  The subgroup will continue to meet on a regular basis to monitor the ongoing implementation of those actions due in 2021, and the small number that fall into 2022.<\/p><p> The action plan sets out 62 actions to bring down costs for consumers and businesses, introduce more competition into the market, prevent fraud and reduce the burden on businesses and community and voluntary organisations.  The action plan will replace the book of quantum with new guidelines on the appropriate level of personal injury awards.  It will enhance the role of PIAB.  It will examine the duty of care to strengthen waivers and notices in order to increase protection for consumers, businesses, sporting clubs and community groups.  It will further strengthen transparency through the expansion of the national claims information database and monitor whether personal injury awards need to be capped.  It will reduce insurance fraud, including by placing perjury on a statutory footing, making the offence easier to prosecute.  It will strengthen the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, examine dual pricing and establish an office within the Government to encourage greater insurance market competition.<\/p><p> I will provide an overview of the plan's principal aims.  First, members will be aware that the Judicial Council has been tasked with adopting new guidelines as to the appropriate level of court awards in personal injury actions.  The new guidelines must be adopted by the Judicial Council no later than 31 July 2021, which is three months earlier than had originally been planned.  While I do not have any influence on these guidelines, I believe that at the very least they will bring both certainty and clarity to the settlement of personal injury actions in the courts.  I further believe that since PIAB assessment levels will also be based on these new guidelines, there will be less incentive for claimants to reject a PIAB settlement and proceed to litigation.  The action plan seeks to examine the duty of care to strengthen waivers and notices to increase protection for consumers, businesses, sporting clubs and community groups.  The Department of Justice is reviewing the legislation in this respect and will bring its findings, including any recommendations, to the subgroup in the very near future.<\/p><p> It is also important to progress the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which it is hoped can be passed by the Oireachtas in early 2021.  For the first time, there will be a statutory offence of perjury which will make it a criminal offence.  It is expected to have a significant deterrent effect in regard to fraudulent insurance claims, particularly if these claims are being made attractive.  The Department of Justice is also increasing co-ordination and co-operation between the Garda and the industry, and examining the publication of insurance data fraud details.<\/p><p> The national claims information database reports have shown the clear benefits of PIAB to consumers.  It plays a critical role in the success of what we are trying to do.  We have seen its impact previously in regard to the cost of insurance and we hope it will have a similar impact again.  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is considering the role and remit of PIAB and, in particular, how to increase the number of cases which are settled by PIAB without having to go through the recourse of litigation.  It is also worth noting the national claims information database report and that PIAB has commenced an advertising initiative recently to increase awareness of the clear benefits of using PIAB.<\/p><p> Encouraging competition in the insurance sector is another innovation in this action plan, and it is one that I believe can benefit the industry as much as it will benefit consumers going forward.  In this regard, I am pleased that an office has been established within the Department of Finance tasked with encouraging greater competition in the insurance sector.  I believe this can provide a far more joined-up approach between State bodies in the area and will adopt a strategic approach to reduce existing barriers to competition.  I chaired the first meeting of this office yesterday.  We will be holding regular meetings and reporting on the ongoing work of this office to the Cabinet subgroup.<\/p><p> Linked to this, the action plan contains a number of important actions to strengthen competition enforcement.  In this regard, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently preparing the draft general scheme of a competition (amendment) Bill.  The Bill will include the transposition of the relevant EU directive, which will represent a step change in competition enforcement in Ireland.  Included in the provisions are a new civil enforcement regime for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  This will include the power to levy significant administrative sanctions, arrange for statutory immunity and leniency and measures to enhance the enforcement of competition law in Ireland.<\/p><p> As members will be aware, on Monday the Central Bank published its interim report on differential pricing in the motor and home insurance sector.  I know this is an issue that is important to members of the committee and I believe it needs to be considered further.  That said, we need to recognise that the interim report notes the issue is complex, and there are winners and losers.  I believe, therefore, it is sensible to await the outcome of the Central Bank's full review before deciding what action is required with regard to dual pricing.  That report will be completed in the coming year.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I remind members of the commitment Insurance Ireland made to this committee that if award levels came down, so would the premiums charged by its members.  I believe this continues to be a very important statement, and it is a commitment the Government intends to hold the insurance industry to.  Yesterday, I met with Insurance Ireland and also with the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  As we begin to emerge from Covid-19 next year, I believe the industry will play a key role in helping to reopen the economy and wider society.  I believe that should costs fall for insurers, whether as a result of the reforms or through lower claims costs as a result of the pandemic, insurers need to reflect these savings to their customers.  I believe this is consistent with the previous statement by the industry that it should treat its customers honestly and fairly at all times.  In that regard, I am personally writing to the CEOs of the main insurers in the State within the next week to outline my views and to ask for a further commitment on how these reforms may reduce premiums.<\/p><p> I hope I have outlined a number of the key elements of our work.  I believe last week's launch demonstrates this is an issue the Government will prioritise.  Once implemented, the key reforms should begin to ease affordability and availability difficulties that consumers and businesses have been experiencing.  I would welcome the views of members and I am open to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#A00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The second half concerns information on profitability and costs.  The Central Bank of Ireland is the regulator and has complete access to all that information on a company-by-company basis.  Part of our work will involve greater liaison with the Central Bank from a governance point of view without interfering with its independence or regulatory role.  It has much data and information.  We saw this with the dual-pricing report issued last week.  The Central Bank has a mountain of information that can be of help to policymakers without requiring discussions between us and the Central Bank that cut across its independent regulatory role.  We will be able to get that information.<\/p> <p>  I have stated in the action plan that we want a breakdown of all the costs associated with what makes up an insurance premium.  For example, it goes without saying that claims are the main element.  Legal fees and company overheads are significant, as are the companies' profit margins.  The reinsurance moneys paid are interesting because, of the top eight or nine insurance companies I met, which represent more than 90% of the insurance market in Ireland, only one is locally owned.  One can take it that practically all the insurance policies being written in Ireland for cars, houses and businesses are being written by foreign multinationals selling into the Irish market.  That means two things.  While the companies are big employers, employing 28,000 in the sector, they are mobile.  The main message I got from them in meetings was that up to now, Ireland has been a volatile market.  There have been ups and downs, and profits and losses can vary depending on what happens.  As a result of what has happened in the industry in recent years, every policyholder in Ireland has been lumped with 5% as part of his or her premium to cover stamp duty and levies, primarily as a result of what happened more recently with Quinn Insurance.  Prior to that, we had the PMPA.  If we go back far enough, we had the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  A point that might never have been made publicly before is that Ireland has a bad history when it comes to its own insurance companies.  There is only one of any substance today, FBD.  Every other insurance policy provider in Ireland is not an Irish company.  That is a major issue and it has added to the volatility of the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  It also leads to a second issue, which is related to getting further information on costs of the insurance companies.  In one-to-one discussions with me, the representatives of some of the companies were relatively open, or as open as they could be given that they could be quoted on stock markets.  There is a certain amount of information they cannot disclose.  Some of the individual companies were much less open because they were not in a position to breach arrangements with their organisation's head office.  I queried every one of the companies on the cost of reinsurance, which tends to be about 10%, based on the information I picked up.  Some of the companies say they are in the market for reinsurance and that they can show me how they get it.  I asked how they fix what they pay for reinsurance.  One said that the head office in Zurich just states what the figure is.  These are the issues I am now dealing with, especially when the companies are not home-grown.  I want to make sure that the payments to the head office do not include an element of profit on top of the normal dividends.<\/p> <p>  The last two costs I want to concentrate on are the costs of fraud and exaggerated cases, which have been difficult to prosecute in the past.  Notably, I met representatives of the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland last week and they told me that, on the day, there were 165,000 uninsured drivers on the Irish roads.  That is 7% of all cars here.  They are uninsured or those driving are not insured to drive them.  The cost has to be met by the people who are paying for policies.  That is why there is a levy to cover some of the costs of the Motor of Insurance Bureau of Ireland.  There are significant elements making up the cost a driver's premium, which may be &euro;500.  Claims are a major issue.  That is what we are delving into now.  I have given the Deputy a flavour of the work we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#C00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Has the Minister of State any proposals to put more pressure on claimants or encourage them to accept awards from PIAB as opposed to going to PIAB and straight to court afterwards?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#C00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I have met representatives of the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland on that issue.  Their view is that their members are brought in only if a client comes to them.  They say their members are not out looking for business.  That is a moot point but what we are doing, as part of a key element, is engaging in PIAB reform.  Under the action plan, there is to be public consultation in the first quarter of next year.  By June 2021, we will have legislative proposals to reform PIAB.  We want it to be the case that when people bring cases to PIAB, they should know that it is the end of the road, by and large, and that by going to court, they will not get any more.<\/p> <p>  This brings me directly to the book of quantum.  Some people believe that if they go to court, they might get a bigger award.  They might get an extra 5% but it is minimal because there are substantial legal costs when going to court.  Therefore, the book of quantum is the issue.  It has been set by PIAB but people feel that if they go to court, they might get more.  What is happening now, which is already well under way owing to previous legislation, is that the book of quantum is going to be set by the Judicial Council.  The last Government had legislation in place.  The council was to report by the end of October next year.  When the council sets the book of quantum, everyone will know it is fixed because it will have been set by the judges.  The judges are not going to set it and have it changed when people go to court after going to PIAB.

Many people, however, may feel that there has been much talk about insurance in recent years but not the necessary level of action.  They might also think that there is an element of horizon politics at work, because these initiatives are still on the horizon and in the future.  If we look at many sectors of the economy, the structure of the market itself has enormous influence on how those sectors function, whether that is in housing, banking, the beef industry or insurance.  Those are dysfunctional markets, to a certain extent, in that a small number of players exert enormous influence.  Six car insurers have 80% of the market, while eight insurers have about 90% of the market in house insurance.  Even if we do not bring in the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the structure of that market is not one which a Government should be looking to create.  We should be seeking to create a far more diverse market so that there is more competition and there are more opportunities for people.  What is going to be done to increase the number of players within the market?<\/p> <p>  There has also been an EU investigation into the insurance market here, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has carried out an investigation.  What plans are there to strengthen the ability of that agency to ensure there is functional competition?  Another issue is that there are no caps on claims.  I understand the absence of a cap in a catastrophic accident case scenario, because that kind of situation would necessitate some judicial understanding of the needs of individuals before making a decision.  For 80% of cases, however, those which are run of the mill, such as soft tissue type of accidents, we should be introducing a cap.  Why has that not happened?  In February, Deputy Michael McGrath, who is now Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, said he would be bringing in caps.  Why has that not been brought into place in this plan?  Perhaps the Minister of State could address those three questions first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#D00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>That is fine.  The first aspect concerns getting more players and competition into the market so that we will not be just relying on eight or ten insurance companies.  That is exactly the reason the new office was established.  It was created to promote competition and it held its first meeting yesterday.  We saw that one of the key problems was exactly as the Deputy described it.  The structure of the market is very small and dependent on companies from outside the State.  That is our number one objective.<\/p> <p>  I chaired the first meeting of that committee yesterday, and that is an aspect on which I would be happy to come back to the committee and report on.  It has been set up specifically in respect of the purpose mentioned by the Deputy.  If we achieve much of what is in the action plan, that in itself will help.  Bringing a bit of stability to the market will be the best way of attracting new businesses into Ireland.  If companies feel that the market here is one where it is not possible for them to predict awards and costs, then that is going to put companies off coming here.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the second issue, I have also noticed in my meetings with the companies that some of them have scaled back their activities.  The representatives from those companies told us that they had been big in the leisure and hospitality areas, but there were so many trips and falls and people crossing the thresholds of businesses that they had been scaling back their activities.  Others, however, have increased their activity in the market.  Some car insurance companies told us that they have scaled back on providing insurance for those aged under 25 years old, while another company has heavily stepped into that same market.  We can, therefore, increase competition in the various insurance sectors by getting all eight or nine companies already there to compete in all the segments in the sector.  The purpose of this new office is to promote competition in the Irish market, by bringing in new businesses and getting those currently in the field to do more business.  Those companies, however, will want a stable market in respect of the cost of claims.  Regarding the EU agency issue mentioned by the Deputy, I do not have the answer in front of me now.  We will send a note on that issue to the committee, if that is okay.  I might get a note on it now, but I will give a comprehensive answer in writing in any event.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the cap on claims, that is something which many people before the previous election, including us, said would be considered.  We said it would be \"considered\".  That was the word used, because nobody could make a blanket statement that we would guarantee to do something.  That is because there may be constitutional implications, especially for the very catastrophic cases.  A young child involved in a car accident could live for 60 or 70 years.  Who can know that?  The Law Reform Commission recently published a report on that specific issue.  That report is independent of all of us and we will be guided by it.  It is stated in that report that we could pass legislation to set awards at a particular level based on the level of injuries, provided that a judge stepping outside those awards in exceptional cases had to state the exact reasons for doing so.<\/p> <p>  The idea of having an absolute cap could require a constitutional amendment.  Some people will say that would be great, and it would allow certainty in 99% of cases and flexibility in 1% of those cases where judges require it.  Other people might suggest that once some people get their foot in the door with the 1% flexibility, there will then be expansion.  We are therefore being guided by the report of the Law Reform Commission.  Having the Judicial Council set the book of quantum will ensure that it will be written by the judges, and the people will know that.  When claimants go to the PIAB seeking awards, they will know that it is not an award which the PIAB made up but an award which the Judicial Council has given to the PIAB to implement according to the book of quantum document.  There will be little incentive to take that award before the judges who have already written that book of quantum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#D00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>If there is flexibility for judges on payouts, then there may still be an incentive because an individual judge could still deviate from the book of quantum.

Setting awards in catastrophic injury cases is a difficult issue to resolve.  We cannot have caps for 99% of the cases and then an exception for the other 1%.

The reason those companies probably do not challenge enough is that, in general, they feel that the courts are on the side of the claimant rather than a foreign multinational insurance company.  That is the perception of the insurance companies regarding how they think cases will be looked at in the courts.

They were so cheap as to prevent the companies issuing them from being viable.  Quinn Insurance is the most recent example of a company that went under because it did not have the necessary reserves.  As a result of that, we are all paying the extra levies I mentioned.  There is a 2% levy and a 3% stamp duty in place to cover the costs arising.  One of these levies raises approximately &euro;40 million per annum and comprises a percentage of every insurance premium.  The legislation requires that a fund of &euro;200 million be built up, which will then be held in reserve on the State's behalf and can be used if another insurance company goes bust so as to avoid having to introduce a new levy every time an insurance company goes bust.  It will take a couple of years to build up that fund.  As we speak, every policyholder in Ireland is paying for the cheap policies that were available earlier because the reserves were not there when needed.  We have now had to introduce levies to build up a fund to prevent that happening again.<\/p> <p>  On cash flow, I do not have a clear answer but I will come back to the Deputy on the issue.  Generally, these companies invest in Government bonds because they are looking for stability.  They obviously have to hold a significant amount in reserve because the industry is regulated.  They must always maintain some cash to meet current claims.  I will seek further information on that issue as part of my ongoing work in my role in the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#E00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

It has been the most keen on helping young drivers under 25 years of age.  It concentrates on that market, which is good.   I hope it continues in that way.  The cost of insurance for young drivers is a big issue but that cost has been coming down.  I have met representatives of many youth organisations and they have said that, while it remains a big issue, the costs have been coming down.  The first year of insurance can be very dear but many young people have said that, by the second or third year, the cost comes down.  I hope this company, which is strong in that market, continues to do as it is doing but I also want more competition.

I am glad the Minister of State mentioned that because I am concerned that, no matter what level of insurance cover is provided, if the entity providing that cover decides to invest foolishly in high-return investment proposals, it will eventually undermine the solvency of the company offering the cover, which will create a problem for insured members of the general public.<\/p> <p>  The question of capping has already been mentioned.  Like everybody else, I have looked at this again and again.  I am not so sure of its merits.  As far as I am concerned, the jury is still out.  One has no way of assessing the extent of an injury in a particular situation and how it might develop in the future.  A classic example is a child receiving serious, life-altering injuries at the age of ten or 12.  Such a child may receive an award that seems to be consistent with the degree of the disability arising and the need to provide a reasonable quality of follow-up services to that person but, unfortunately, with the passage of time even a high award will diminish and may be insufficient to meet modern-day demands.  I and, I am sure, everybody else have seen cases in which large awards were given to children who had become wards of court.  In these cases, the awards came to be less significant over time and it became very difficult to eke out sufficient funds to cater for these people, who were now adults of 45, 50 or 60 years of age.  I would like such people to be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  I have two or three last questions.  I know many motor insurance claims are said to be exaggerated and that there are questions around whiplash and so on.  We have looked at these issues but, at the time and the site of an accident, it is not always possible to have all information made available.  The person directly involved may not be in a position to give such information and his or her recollection of the accident may be flawed due to shock or other factors.  I believe we have a responsibility to look after the people who are injured in such situations and that we should try to ensure that they are not disadvantaged because, it is to be hoped, they have a life to live afterwards.<\/p> <p>  My next point relates to when an insurance company informs the insured that he or she is liable and must accept responsibility.  This is classic stuff.  That is an arbitrary decision on which people should be very slow to come to a conclusion.  Again, the person involved in the accident, whether that accident was little or large, may not be in the best position to judge whether he or she was liable.  I know that, like myself, everybody here has dealt with cases in which people asked why they were liable only to be told it was because the injured party was crossing the road at the time of the accident.  There is a failure to mention that the insured party was stopped at the time and that a vehicle coming in the other direction ploughed into them.  The owners of this vehicle manage to walk off with no liability whatsoever whereas the person who followed due process, who stopped when an accident was about to occur, is held liable.  That also needs to be borne in mind.  The advice of the insured person's insurance company may sometimes be wrong, leading to a liability on the part of the insured which should not arise.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman will be glad to know I only have two last points.  The first is on health insurance and, in particular, death benefit.  Every one of us could paper the walls with correspondence on the cases we have had to deal with regarding people who were not really covered at all when one read the small print.  In these cases, if the insured people had read the small print more carefully, they would have realised they were not covered.  There are other cases in which people were found to have already been suffering from an illness which could then have related to their later demise.  As a result, it is argued that no liability arises as far as the insurance company is concerned even though medical evidence was made available in such cases demonstrating that the person died from a totally different illness or complaint.  The theory seems to be that the existing illness might have led to the later complaint and that the insurance company cannot be sure.<\/p><p>We do not know about that and we will never know.  <\/p><p> The last thing I want to talk about concerns drivers who were not born in this jurisdiction, although they may be Irish citizens, and who are involved in a road traffic accident.  Sometimes they may not have the best English to explain themselves.  Not so long ago I dealt with a case where the person was summoned to court, fined and deemed to be liable for the accident.  I am not a lawyer, and I apologise to all the lawyers present and the police outside, but when I examined the case, there was no way the driver was liable as he had observed the rules.  The insurance company said he was liable beyond all doubt.  However, the person took the case to court and won.  We went back to the insurance company stating that it had been clearly demonstrated that the insured person was not liable and asking it whether it was in a position to resolve the matter.  Reluctantly, after an awful lot of hand-wringing, the result was accepted.  That is the kind of everyday thing that we, as representatives, have to deal with.  I am sure the Minister of State has had to deal with such cases as well.  A balance must be struck between the outrageously high awards and a need to ensure the general public is protected and that the State does not have to come in help the people who should have been sufficiently provided for in the first instance by the insurers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#E00500","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I take the comments on board.

It has stated that home insurance will go up by 35% and motor insurance by 25%.  These companies, which have a legal responsibility under the consumer protection code to act fairly, honestly and with integrity with their consumers, have basically lied to the Government and their consumers, as well as having false documents on their website, because they are hiding the fact that dual pricing is an issue.  I made a major complaint, as well as a submission of 130 pages, to the Central Bank on dual pricing over a year ago.  Page 12 outlined exactly what the Central Bank found, which is that the longer one is with an insurance company, the more one will be fleeced by it.  The graph is the same as that in this report.<\/p> <p>  What is the Minister of State going to do now that the insurance companies have lied to the Government and to their consumers in not acknowledging that dual pricing, price-walking or price optimisation - whatever one wants to call it - is a factor in premiums being pushed up?  What is he going to do about the fact that they have breached the consumer protection code?  Is he going to challenge them?<\/p> <p>  In 2015, the then Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, wrote to the then Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, stating that representatives of regulated entities, insurance companies, were providing deliberately false information to the Central Bank but it had no remedy to deal with this issue because there was a lacuna in the legislation.  I have challenged Governments upside down, inside out and produced legislation to close that gap.

Then we are trying to battle against all the false narratives.  For example, one of the final sections of the Central Bank report refers to false narratives such as costs of claims increases and fraud.  While there are issues in that regard which have to be dealt with, none of this is the reason insurance premiums have been increasing.  One of the main reasons is actually price-walking or dual pricing which is about boosting the profits of the industry.  The Minister of State should not take the industry at its word.  He needs to challenge everything it says.  It is unfortunate that one of the first things the Minister of State did was suggest that recommendation No. 1 was implemented when, clearly, it was not.

Page 12 in my report looks at what the Central Bank has done.  They nearly coalesce.  It is in the same ballpark.  After nine years or more the premiums charged are 30% higher.  After the first year and into the second and third years, it is approximately 10% higher.  We talk of this as the loyalty premium.<\/p><p> I have asked for dual pricing to be banned for more than a year.  I asked the Central Bank to carry out an investigation, which it agreed to do, on receipt of my report.  The Central Bank has confirmed everything in my initial claim.  In Trump's America, dual pricing is banned in 20 states.  In Britain, it will probably be banned in the second quarter of next year.  In fact, it is not probably; they are going to ban it.  The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, in the UK has made it clear that it will ban dual pricing.  Yet, the Government here is not willing to make a policy decision that this practice will end.  Let us be clear about what this means.  The Central Bank's report conclusions are, as we can extrapolate, that some 2.5 million policy holders in the State were charged annually &euro;187 million more than it costs to insure those policies.  In Britain, where they have done far more research on this, they estimate that the banning of dual pricing would benefit the consumers there by between &euro;4 billion and &euro;12 billion.  The FCA says that average prices would decrease by between 10% and 15% for consumers and that it would encourage competition in the market.  Why is the Government delaying on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#G02000","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>As I said, the staff of new office to promote competition in the insurance market only met yesterday for the first time.

The Central Bank should not have had to be told by a Member of the Oireachtas to carry out this work.  It is way behind the curve on this matter.  These insurance companies have been practicing dual pricing for ages.  What we know from the Central Bank's work is that this is happening and that people are being price gouged the longer they stay with an insurance company.  It is not just about not renewing a policy; these insurance companies gather information on their consumers.  They gather data through legal means, which the customer gives in the renewal policy or when taking out a new policy.  The companies can also gather the information by purchasing third party information about our shopping and other habits, and they can gather information from social media posts and videos that people put up.  This information is gathered for one purpose: how can they increase prices before we decide to move to a competitor.  It should be banned.  The Government should make a statement of intent that this practice will end and that it is going to protect consumers.  In the middle of next year, for example, Aviva will not be able to price gouge their customers, motorists and homeowners in Belfast, Newry or Derry.  Aviva here, however, will still be able to engage in dual pricing.

When a person gets a renewal notice and automatically sends back the cheque the insurance company knows that this person never contests the costs of their policy and the person is deemed a soft touch.  If a person rings the insurance company and says \"I want to check the price\" and then rings back a fortnight later, because he or she must be issued with the renewal premium notice one month in advance, they will be able to tell the customer that he or she rang three weeks ago at such a time.

I wish him well in his role and I know that he is committed to it.  More than 25 years ago, a gentleman walked into my premises and fell and broke his hip.  He was an English gentleman and claimed through the English system, to the relief of the Irish insurance company, because the claim was capped.  That was 25 years ago and we have much to catch up on with regard to claims.  A key issue in Ireland is that one does not know what the payout will be.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the whole-of-government approach to the insurance industry.  I know it spreads across a number of Departments and is quite complex.  Equally, I hope that the Government will look at individual sections, because much can be done that does not necessarily require other Departments to be involved.  Most people have spoken about high-level matters.  I want to focus on the clients, the role of clients and their interaction with insurance companies.  Having run my own business for more than 30 years, I have had numerous engagements with insurance companies, some of which have been positive, while others have been negative.  As the Minister of State mentioned, transparency about what one is entitled to know as a client and the information one is given has been an issue.  I went to court on one occasion to give my evidence and the claim was settled while we were at lunch.  I am still waiting to find out what exactly was settled and how exactly the settlement was reached.<\/p> <p>  Companies are being held to ransom more and more because there is not competition in the insurance industry.  We are getting more fearful about what we can or cannot do.  Another example of a practical experience is a claim a number of years ago, which we were not aware of until it arrived in the post from a solicitor.  We rang the insurance company to say there was a potential claim.  The insurance company said it was not notified of that claim when it occurred and I said that I was not notified of it either.  The company said that I must notify it if there was a potential claim.  Now when one is looking at renewing insurance, one looks at the number of potential claims that are on one's books that may never turn into a claim, yet one is penalised because of them.  One then has a number of actual claims on one's books.  Some might be genuine while many are fraudulent.  They can hang in a system for six to eight years before they are settled.  During that process, one has to pay a premium because the claim sits on one's books, unresolved.  I would like to see much more focus on transparency and reform.<\/p> <p>  I feel that as a client, I am not treated fairly or getting enough information to allow me to understand why the premiums that I am presented with are coming.  Having had a 15 year clear record, my insurance jumped by 300% in two years, and almost made the company unviable.  Even my  own brother, who is a chartered accountant, looked at the option of providing our own insurance, because we could not pay the premium we were being asked for.  That happened because we had three claims after 15 years without any.  The three claims, which are now four years old, still have not progressed anywhere and no settlement has been made on any of them, but we pay a premium on that year after year.  There is no clawback on that.  The insurance company will not say that because the claim was never settled and nothing was paid out on it, one will get the premiums paid for the last four years back.  I would like to see more work on transparency and what we are entitled to as clients with regard to the operation of the insurance industry.<\/p> <p>  Under GDPR, we are not allowed to hold our video evidence for longer than a month.  It is a simple, practical thing.  One thing that worked in our favour was that when we were told of a potential claim, we had CCTV on file.  Unless that claim comes within a month, that CCTV information has to be wiped.  If somebody makes a claim in six months, I have no evidence.  I have nothing to back me up, as a client, to try to mitigate that claim.  I find it frustrating that when I hold my hands up and say that a genuine accident took place and think I was liable, the person on the other side will be put through the same process even though we are holding our hands up.  The fraudulent ones drag things out and every year that they drag it out is another year with excess on my premium.  The Minister of State mentioned the level of competition.  There is no competition for the hospitality sector at the moment and one is held to ransom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#J00200","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I have listened carefully to the Senator.  I am here to give an update and to hear the committee's views.  Members have made clear that we all have a common interest in this.  The Senator is clear that if one notifies an insurance company of a potential claim, it marks it on the book as a potential claim and makes a provision for it, stating that it might cost &euro;6,000 whenever it comes to settled.  It is marked against the policyholder and the company makes provision for it.  If that potential claim never materialises into an actual claim, is there a write-back or clawback for the extra increase?  I am conscious of that and will take it up with the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland.  It would seem fair if a company makes a provision on the basis of something happening.  Banks do it all the time, making a provision for loans in financial statements.  If it reassesses the provision a year later and finds that it was too generous, it will write it back and it will go back into the system.  The same should happen here, with insurance companies writing back provisions they make and passing it on to the customer.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the situation with regard to video evidence.  I do not know the answer to that but we will look at it.  Businesses can be defenceless if somebody waits for a significant period before making a claim, at which time there will be no video evidence in place to prove otherwise.  While that legislation has good points, it has downsides related to these issues.  While I am sure other people will have a different view, if the law provides a certain period in which a person can make a claim, logic would say that the person against whom the claim has been made should have an equal right to be able to defend himself or herself for the same period by having CCTV available.  I am not giving that commitment but I am saying that logic suggests that it should be looked at.  It is an issue that we will have to take up with the Data Protection Commissioner, the Department of Justice and many people in wider society.  It is not fair that one side of litigation can be disadvantaged by not having access to information that it had but was required to destroy, or is not allowed to use in a case to defend itself.

The Senator might note my earlier comment that this is the problem with insurance in Ireland.  We have only one Irish insurance company.  I am sure more than 80% of all insurance policies written in Ireland are written by foreign companies.  As I said, I have met the eight largest insurance companies operating in Ireland.  Only one, FBD, is Irish owned.  The rest of them are foreign multinationals.  The issue the Senator highlighted of a person having to get cover from a foreign insurance company is what happens in the case of 85% of all insurance policies in Ireland.  That is an issue with which we need to deal.<\/p> <p>  I highlighted that the history of Irish insurance companies has not been good.  All we need do is note what happened with Quinn Insurance.

We are picking up the cost of that, and prior to that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland also went bust.  Three major Irish insurance companies have gone bust.  That is not a good track record for any country to have.  We have only one Irish insurance company left.  We are relying on foreign multinational insurance companies to provide insurance cover for almost everything in Ireland.  I want increased competition in that area to increase what is available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#K00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I heard the Minister of State say this issue has been satisfactorily dealt with in terms of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#K00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#K00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I am dealing with a company involved in adventure services that cannot source insurance here.

I was at a meeting immediately before I came here with a group who are working with a small group of people who are trying to get insurance for a bouncy castle type of industry group.  The insurance company that was providing the cover was a UK company and was governed by UK standards with respect to the annual testing of the equipment.  Those standards did not apply in Ireland.  People thought they had insurance cover only to find their claim was not accepted, and when somebody checked the small print for them, they found their claim did not apply.  Such a company would not have cover if it made a claim because it would not meet the UK standards of inspection.  Clear issues arise.<\/p> <p>  That group raised with me exactly the point the Senator has made, namely, to see if something could be done across the sector.  Some of those involved are voluntary and community groups as well as some very small businesses that might have one employee or be a self-employed person.  The issue of the community groups was raised.  I asked about the Tidy Towns groups and where they get their insurance.  The 500 or 600 Tidy Town groups around the country generally make their own individual arrangements.  If there is a federation operating at a county level for Tidy Town federations or community groups through the public participation networks, PPNs, in the local authorities, I would see a great opportunity for somebody to work on a collective basis bringing groups together engaged in similar activities to get a group insurance policy in place.

One can drive down the road and get fuel in one filling station at one price but at a different price in another filling station a mile down the road.  A level of competition between companies in a given area of activity on the same product is valid and helpful.  It gives consumers choice if they shop around.  Having said that, not everybody goes to the filling station that sells the cheapest fuel.  If that was the case, none of the more expensive ones would do business.  People make choices on a number of bases, one of which is the price of the insurance.  In some instances, people might be happy with the personnel they have dealt with in the company or the service they have received.  It may be the case that they had claims years ago which were looked at satisfactorily.  Quality of service comes into it as well; it is not just a matter of the price of the product.  Price is a major element in people's decisions but the quality of the product is also important, as is the small print because there can be several exclusions.<\/p><p> When looking at the issue of dual pricing and at introducing legislation to deal with it, we must ensure everything is on an equal footing because we do not want people to lose out financially.

He can.  I will talk about motor insurance.  I am reminded of the words of the late great Woody Guthrie who said that, as he travelled through life, he met many kinds of men; some would rob him would rob him with a six-gun and others with a fountain pen.  I certainly think that is applicable to the insurance industry in this country.  The area of motor insurance really underlines that point.  I put it to the Minister of State that the issue here is, first and foremost and overwhelmingly, one of plain old-fashioned profiteering.  Even a cursory look at the facts underlines that this is the case.<\/p> <p>  I will not try to blind the committee with science or with an avalanche of facts and figures, but let us have a look at a few.  Between 2009 and 2019, the volume of claims decreased substantially, by 45%.  The cost of claims was also down 9%.  One would expect that, in those circumstances, premiums would have fallen but not only have they not fallen, they increased by 35% between 2009 and 2019.  It is little wonder that profits of &euro;142 million were raked in by the motor insurance sector.  This was once again an increase on the previous year, and not by a small amount but by 9%.  That is quite a hike in this space over only 12 months.  How does this compare to other jurisdictions?  Many of the big insurance corporations that operate in this State also operate in the UK.  Do they get more bang for their buck in the UK or in the Republic of Ireland?  There is no comparison.  They make nearly double the profits per unit of investment here that they do in the UK.  <\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, a stop must be put to this profiteering.  There is only question really worth considering.  What is the best and most effective way to put a halt to profiteering and to provide an efficient service of good quality for the population?  That is only real issue here.  From many of the contributions to this discussion, and certainly from those of the Minister of State, it seems to be taken as a given that it is all about competition.  Motor insurance could actually be organised in such a way that there would be zero competition while providing a far better and cheaper reliable service for ordinary people.  It happens in other jurisdictions.  In some other jurisdictions, the cost of motor insurance claims for a given year is calculated and a little bit more is added to allow for rollover of certain investments.  The number of motorists using petrol and diesel respectively is calculated.  An additional charge is then levied on petrol and diesel which then builds up the fund to pay the costs of motor insurance payouts.  That has been done in the past in New Zealand and in various provinces of Canada.<\/p><p>It is not a particularly complex scheme to work out.  That would be one way of doing it.<\/p><p> I would favour focus on and debate around the idea that the people have been bled dry for years by the motor insurance rip-off.  Let us look at the idea of public ownership and nationalisation.  Does that mean compensation for shareholders?  Yes it does if it is a pension fund or an ordinary person who has invested a few bob in shares, but for millionaire and billionaire shareholders, then no, it does not.  Then the resources available to society are used for the common good and providing a decent service but eliminating the profit motive from it.  I am open to a discussion and debate around those points but it should be on the basis of how we get to the root of the issue here, and the root of the issue is profiteering.  The debate has to be around the best way to eliminate profiteering from the insurance industry.  Does the Minister of State accept the proposition that the fundamental problem here is profiteering?  If he does not accept that, I want to hear an argument against it because it seems that the facts speak very clearly to it and the majority of ordinary people who have experienced the insurance racket and the motor insurance rip-off would be interested in hearing the argument against that because I think they are convinced that is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2020121600002#L01000","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>We are caught for time again, so I will also put some questions before the Minister of State answers.  To give an example, Irish Life issues a premium to one of its clients for life assurance of &euro;1,049.  This year, it went up by &euro;360 per month, a colossal increase.  There is no justification for it.  The policy is for elderly people and so they are finding it really difficult to grapple with a huge company like that and get some form of justice.  Charlie Weston's article in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>which quotes from the Central Bank, is headlined &quot;Elderly hit hardest&quot;.  It is the elderly and vulnerable who find it most difficult to move around and change insurance companies to test the cost of premium against another company.  They are really suffering badly.  Out of respect for those who are marginalised or elderly, we should do something specific about their cases now to assist them in the context of the rip-off that is taking place and the fact that their vulnerability is what is playing against them.  It is shocking in the extreme that a big insurance company that is profiteering, gouging and into price fixing, to a degree, will target the elderly in the way it does and make it impossible for them to exercise their right to change insurance companies.  I ask the Minister of State to address that specifically or give me information on how a Member of the House can address it directly to the company because it is an outrage.<\/p><p>Second, for the last term in Government, I listened patiently here to the arguments around the insurance companies and what they were doing and the rather big talk about reform and very little action.  The T&aacute;naiste, in particular, in the foreword by him to this document, has a brass neck to make the comments he has made.  One would be led to believe that he had just been elected to the D&aacute;il and that he had no input on this in the previous Government when he did.  This committee listened to many contributions giving us the impression that we are actually moving to a point where the insurance companies were going to be stopped in their tracks in how they treated their customers and that did not happen.  Now we are embarking on a new Government, of which the Minister of State is part, and I will be looking for actions, not reports.  In this foreword the T&aacute;naiste says, &quot;It is my firm intention to have updates on these timelines on a quarterly basis.&quot;  He is making a mockery of what is going on here and he needs to be challenged on it in the Department of Finance because all we have had for the past four years has been this type of play on words and play on presentation to give the impression that actually we are doing something positive and people will feel a reduction in their premiums.  I know from my premium and those of business that they have all gone up and not gone down.  I would say the same, and the Minister of State is photographed beside him, to Paschal Donohoe.<\/p><p>The content of that foreword must disgust people because of what they know is happening in the insurance industry.  I ask for clear action across the board to bring down the cost of insurance.  Insurance Ireland made presentations here, as did others.  The one thing that came across in every presentation that was made - there was one side against the other, the insurance companies on one side, and the customers on the other - was that the insurance companies and their umbrella organisation were simply not making the information available about what is happening in Ireland in terms of insurance.  Therefore an outside player comes in blind rather than being fully informed.  That, in short, is the problem.  We will certainly have engagements with the Minister of State over the duration of the Government, but on reflection, our engagement with the previous Administration and Minister was hopeless.  I would like to be able to say differently but that is not the case.  The Minister of State says the subcommittee is dealing with this.

It is a little longer than five minutes but not too much longer.  I will try to shorten it as much as I can to make it more accessible for the members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The Government established the High-Level Task Force on Covid-19 Vaccination on 10 November 2020 to ensure that the right oversight and specialist input is available to support the HSE and the Department of Health in the effective, efficient and agile delivery of the Covid-19 vaccination programme.  I was appointed chair of the task force, which has met three times to date.  A fourth meeting is scheduled for this afternoon. <\/p> <p>  The agreed terms of reference are: to support the Department of Health and Health Service Executive to deliver a Covid-19 immunisation programme, that meets best practice and provides good governance, as a critical public health intervention in the prevention and control of Covid-19; working with the Department of Health and the HSE, to develop a national Covid-19 vaccination strategy and implementation plan for the safe, effective and efficient procurement, distribution, delivery and recording of Covid-19 vaccines when approved vaccines are ready to be distributed; to provide a focal point for engagements with sectoral and specialist expertise as may be needed to support the development, implementation and agile iteration of both the strategy and the plan; and to monitor progress and report to Government, as may be required, on the development and implementation of the strategy and plan. <\/p> <p>  When the task force was established, there was already significant work on a vaccination programme ongoing across both the HSE and the Department of Health, and implementation of the strategy will rely in the normal way on the governance structures and statutory responsibilities of a range of existing bodies.  Given the range of responsibilities and actors, and the level of responsiveness that will be required as the programme rolls out, there will be a need to augment and support existing arrangements.  It is useful in that context to be clear about the role of the task force in the context of those existing roles and responsibilities. <\/p> <p>  In respect of immunisation programmes and policies, the role of the Department of Health includes making policy decisions based on advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, these are then implemented by the HSE through the National Immunisation Office, NIO.  In the context of this vaccination programme, the Department of Health has responsibility for overall public health policy, legislative and regulatory arrangements, and EU co-operation arrangements, and it is also leading on communications for the programme.  The HSE has ultimate responsibility for the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccination programme through its NIO, which designs and implements all vaccination programmes in Ireland.  The role of the NIO in the vaccination programme includes vaccine procurement and distribution; immunisation training; certain communications to the public; and logistical considerations for vaccine storage, and distribution and return where appropriate.  The HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, is responsible for compiling and publishing data in respect of uptake and coverage of Covid-19 vaccines, liaising closely with the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC. <\/p> <p>  Where medicines are licensed centrally for all EU member states, as in this case, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, works closely with the European Medicines Agency, EMA, including participating in the EMA assessment process and post-marketing benefit-risk monitoring. The HPRA operates the national safety monitoring and risk management system and oversees quality defect reports on vaccines and other medicines. It also licences the facilities that carry out related manufacturing and distribution. <\/p> <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET oversees and provides national direction, guidance, support and expert advice on the development and implementation of a strategy to contain Covid-19 in Ireland.<\/p><p>It advises the Government on the public health aspects of the cross-Government response to Covid-19, including on the vaccination programme and, in particular, prioritisation in the context of pandemic management.<\/p><p> Both the HPSC and the Department of Health work closely with the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC, and the Department is represented on the Health Security Committee, HSC, of the European Commission, which co-ordinates the EU response to infectious disease threats.  These will continue to provide advice on the vaccination programme and its impact in terms of pandemic management, the sequencing of the roll-out of the vaccine and the response to any emerging issues.<\/p><p> The challenge in devising and implementing a vaccination programme of this scale, complexity and desire for speed is unparalleled here and around the world.  Successful roll-out of the vaccination programme is dependent upon careful and precise co-ordination across Government, several State agencies, the HSE and a wide range of advisory, regulatory and delivery partners across the health sector and private sector providers.<\/p><p> The high-level task force I chair is ensuring that all of this ongoing work is co-ordinated within a single integrated work programme and supporting the Department of Health and the HSE to deliver a Covid-19 vaccination programme that meets best practice and good governance and it will play an ongoing role in the oversight and monitoring of programme implementation, harnessing the wide range of high-level expertise and experience of task force members.  The task force includes senior representatives from across the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the HPRA, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of Government Procurement, IDA Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Taoiseach.  It includes expertise in the areas of public health, supply chain logistics, cold chain logistics, and programme management.<\/p><p> A programme office has been established to support the high-level task force in its ongoing oversight and support role.  An integrated work programme, comprising seven work streams, has been established by the high-level task force, HLTF, which fully integrates the work that is ongoing across the Department of Health and the HSE.  The programme is using a structured programme and project management approach to manage and deliver all the core elements.  I will not list all of the work streams but I am happy to talk about them at any stage, as they affect all the core elements of the end-to-end vaccination process.<\/p><p> Each work stream is led by a senior responsible officer, SRO, and is supported by programme and project professionals as well as subject matter experts.  The SROs, the programme director and a number of subject matter experts form a programme working group, which has been established to co-ordinate, integrate and to report progress on work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#A01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>I must stop Professor MacCraith.

I am here today in my capacity as chair of that committee.  It is less than one year since any one of us first heard of Covid.  Since then, globally, more than 72 million people have been infected and just over 1.6 million have died.  In Ireland, there have been more than 76,000 cases and 2,000 deaths.  Spurred by the urgency of the problem, it has taken scientists less than one year to develop effective vaccines.  We are now preparing for the roll-out of potentially three, but likely six, different Covid vaccines over the coming year.<\/p> <p>  Even just two to three years ago, the speed at which this has happened was inconceivable.  However, although rapid, it has not been rushed or reckless.  Rather, the speed is a reflection of the extraordinary advancements in the vaccination field that were under way before Covid19, harnessed together with unprecedented scientific co-operation and financial and human resource investment.  In the case of Covid, there was already much vaccine research that could be built on to facilitate rapid development of the vaccines and compress usual timelines.  Covid19 vaccine development was a single common global priority.  Large-scale investment both in human resource and finance enabled many steps to be undertaken in parallel and with much greater efficiency.  As Covid19 was, unfortunately, all too common and people were eager to help in finding a solution, recruitment to clinical trials was rapid.  Similarly, as symptomatic Covid19 and severe Covid disease were also very common, clinical trial endpoints, that is, reaching the point in a trial where one is able to tell if there was a difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, were quickly reached.<\/p> <p>  Vaccine safety is an overriding concern.  With vaccination, a higher safety bar is required than for most other medical interventions, as vaccines are administered to healthy individuals or those with stable underlying medical conditions.  Most adverse events following immunisation have onset within six weeks of vaccination.  Thus, a minimum median follow up of two months was required prior to evaluation of the clinical trial data by the regulatory agencies.  As with all newly licensed vaccines, it is possible that some rare or very rare, less than 1:10,000, adverse events following immunisation, AEFI, particularly those unique to specific populations, may not be known when the Covid19 vaccines are authorised.  Thus, it is critically important that, as planned, continued surveillance in the post-marketing phase is undertaken when vaccines will be administered not to tens of thousands but millions of individuals.<\/p> <p>  The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is likely to be the first Covid19 vaccine administered in Ireland.  Data from the randomised phase 3 trial based on more than 36,000 participants demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 95% in those aged 16 and over.  There were nine cases of Covid19 in almost 20,000 vaccinated participants compared with 169 cases in a similar number of placebo recipients.  These results far exceeded what had been hoped.  It can be anticipated however that, as vaccine is rolled out in the real world, the effectiveness is likely to drop a little compared to the very controlled clinical trial situation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding safety, local site reactions and, less commonly, more general shortterm systemic reactions such as fatigue, flu-like symptoms and fever, can be anticipated.  These events occurred at increased frequency following the second vaccine dose and were more common in the younger rather than older age groups.  These effects are partly a result of the efficacy of the vaccines in stimulating the immune response.  We will know more detail about the side effects when the licence documentation is published by the EMA.  Reports from the regulatory agencies in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada raised no significant safety concerns.  Reports of anaphylactic-type reaction in two vaccines in the UK outside of the clinical trial naturally draw attention.  Vaccine-associated anaphylaxis or severe immediate allergic reaction is extremely rare.  It is estimated to occur at 1.31 per million vaccine doses.  Its occurrence in the UK is being investigated.  Continued surveillance data is needed to determine whether this was a chance occurrence or whether the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid19 vaccine is associated with a higher risk of allergy compared with other vaccines.<\/p> <p>  It is standard practice for vaccinations to be administered by trained health professionals who are appropriately trained in the management of anaphylaxis and have the appropriate equipment available.  Where there is doubt, rather than forgoing the benefits of vaccination, appropriate advice should be sought from the relevant specialist or the local immunisation team.  NIAC was asked to advise regarding prioritisation for vaccination, given that there will be limited vaccine supply in the initial phases of the rollout.  Recommendations were informed by local epidemiology, focused on the key objectives to prevent Covid19 associated disease and death, while striving to ensure equitable access with attention to the ethical principles of moral equality, minimising harm, fairness and reciprocity.  Recommendations are based on the currently available evidence and are subject to updating and refinement as data pertaining to risk groups is refined, vaccine availability increases and as even more data regarding the different vaccines is collated and analysed.  The document should be regarded as a living document and subject to updating.  In summary, this is an exciting time when we can be filled with hope that we are being equipped to begin a path back towards a more normal lifestyle.  This will not happen overnight.<\/p><p>There are many challenges ahead, including providing clear, accurate, and up-to-date information to potential vaccine recipients such that they can feel fully informed of the potential benefits, the direct benefit in preventing Covid19 for themselves, the benefit of reducing the case numbers for our communities and to accurately balance that against any small but as yet unknown risks that might be associated with vaccinations.<\/p><p> A further challenge is to finalise the development of a national injury redress program to provide support and care in the event that any vaccine recipient develops a serious vaccine reaction as recommended by the WHO.  We have been relatively lucky in Ireland.  Our case numbers are remarkable given what has happened in many other countries in Europe and elsewhere.  Data have shown that in early autumn we were on an identical trajectory to other countries.  Significant restrictions impacting how we live and causing significant economic hardship for some, has brought relief from spiralling case numbers.  However, we cannot continue to depend indefinitely on those measures. <\/p><p> Vaccination is the key that will help open that pathway back to normality.  It is very our hope that in time, this virus will be listed along with other infections such as diphtheria and polio as organisms that vaccination has controlled, if not completely conquered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank everyone for the work they have done and continue to do to address the challenges of Covid-19.

From reading the strategy and the plan, it is clear the guidance and advice received from the European Commission in October has been used to develop these and that the plan is in line with international best practice outlined by the EU, such as ensuring that we view the vaccine as an addition rather than a replacement for other measures, target at-risk groups, resource the deployment properly, and that there is co-operation and consultation with our European partners and neighbours.<\/p> <p>  What engagement has there been with GPs and pharmacists on the roll-out of the plan?  <\/p> <p>  The most important part of the plan is the immense need to build confidence in the vaccine programme and in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines.  Five companies have been signed up so far.  It is vital that people are given accurate, factual, objective information about the importance of the vaccine but also its safety and effectiveness.  We saw this in the early stages of Covid when there was a lot of explaining what it was, how it operates, how it spreads, how it effects the body, the signs to watch for and, most importantly, what one needs to do to protect oneself and others.  That is what is needed now.  To what extent has there been engagement in implementing the most effective communication and public awareness campaign?  Have we identified the organisation or agency most responsible for this?  The European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine, while the HPRA advises on the regulation and safety of medicines and vaccines.  Which organisation will lead the information and public awareness campaign?  It is not enough to react; we must actively build and maintain confidence.  False claims and misleading information can spread faster than the virus itself and be just as lethal.  <\/p> <p>  What is the view of the witnesses on actions such as an information booklet being sent to every household with details on vaccines, how they work, what they do and details on the sources of the research and engaging with social media companies including Facebook and Twitter so that inaccurate, misleading or scaremongering claims are marked as disputed in a similar way to some of President Trump's tweets claiming he had won the election are marked as being disputed, and so on?  People could then be directed to an impartial, verified accurate account providing that information.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly agree with the assertion in the implementation plan that vaccines are a proven and cost-effective intervention to protect public health, second only to the provision of clean water.  However, I worry about the impact of campaigns to discredit vaccines.  I fear they will cost lives if we do not prepare properly and proactively.

Specifically on immunisation, it is worth reflecting that significant work was done in the area more generally in regard to the HPV vaccine and the establishment of the Vaccine Alliance back in September 2019.  Hopefully all that will come to fruition - and the alliance has met in recent days - so that we can move this forward.  Significant information is up online both on the HSE website, <i>immunisation.ie<\/i>, and <i>gov.ie\/covid, <\/i>which has specific information on Covid vaccines.<br\/><br\/>As a general point, while obviously we are concerned about misinformation and the extent to which that might influence people's intention to get vaccinated.  It is important we do not give a perception that is a majority view.  We know that 70% to 80% of people in Ireland either definitely or probably will get the vaccine when they are offered.  Perhaps rather than focusing on vaccine hesitancy <i>per se, <\/i>we should promote and build even better levels of vaccine confidence.<\/p><p>What we need to do is continue to build on the basic information materials that were sent out over the past year and, hopefully, over the coming weeks as we get more information from the European Medicines Agency but also in consultation with NIAC, the HPRA and the HSE national immunisation office.

My understanding is that many of these companies have already produced tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of doses that are simply waiting for regulatory approval.  I will start with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  Do we have any idea how many of the 2.2 million doses we are in line to get under the advanced purchase agreement as part of the European Commission's proposals?  Do we have any idea how many of those will come on stream when or if regulatory approval is given?  Let us just that the regulator signs off on this vaccine on whenever date it is.

Regarding the potential imminent granting of conditional marketing authorisation, CMA, possibly as early as 23 December, the only strong indication we have is that a small supply of an initial quantity of vaccines is likely to be delivered to us before the end of December but we do not have confirmed details of exactly what we will be getting and when.

Should the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have to wait in line until their time comes or do our guests think it would helpful, from a public confidence point of view, if they were to receive the vaccine initially?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#F00400","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The useful thing with the list of patient priorities is that it is a transparent description, not just that there are priority groups but that they are arrived at based on the ethical principles that I described and that are contained in the document.

As I said at the beginning, this is a living document.  We have to be pragmatic and flexible.  For example, if a vial of vaccine with five doses in it is being opened and four people who are scheduled turn up to receive it and there is a fifth person in the room who is not on the priority list, the vaccine is not going to be wasted if that fifth person is agreeable to getting it.  There should be that level of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  The point the Deputy has made about people in leadership roles is important and we should be able to do whatever helps people and builds confidence.  However, that does not apply to a point where people feel that we are holding back or depriving someone else.  I am sure that people do not want to be seen as if they are jumping ahead.  This is a finely balanced situation.  There are people who absolutely want to be up there at the front of the line.  We do not want others who feel they should put themselves ahead of the queue.  We have got to be reasonable about it.  That is all I have to say on that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about delays.  I am not involved in the logistics of this, but we may get a limited amount of a vaccine.  We all need to recognise the time of year we are in.  The first priorities are people in nursing homes and healthcare professionals.  It is not going to be a matter of completing that as number 1 on the list and moving on to number 2.  We will be looking at what is practical and some of those people may be vaccinated in parallel.  It may not be reasonable to land suddenly at a nursing home to give vaccinations in the period between Christmas and the new year.  People need to have time to get the information and give informed consent.  It may be reasonable to start vaccinating a small group who are at the highest risk.  Those might be the vaccinators themselves or people in critical care areas and emergency rooms.  That kind would be a practical approach to using the vaccine as soon as it becomes available and not delaying anybody's vaccination.<\/p> <p>  As I said earlier and as is contained in the statement, all of this has to be done rapidly but not rushed.  Even during the little delays that are occurring at this stage, we are learning as we go along.  We are getting the experience from the beginning of the roll-out in other areas, and all of that is to the good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I thank all of our guests for their attendance and for the incredible work that they have been doing, particularly in recent times.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions to ask about the practicalities of registration but I will start with one on clinical advice.  I would appreciate a response on it.  It has regard to the potential impact of the vaccine on fertility.  I note that pregnant women are in the 14th category, which is the last, so the question is unlikely to arise for some time.  We also need clarification with regard to breastfeeding mothers.  At yesterday's launch, Dr. Lorraine Nolan said that there are implications for fertility.  Women considering pregnancy or fertility treatment were advised to put that off or, otherwise, to put off having the vaccine.  I know it is early days, but it is important that advice be made available for women in these circumstances, who constitute a big part of the population.

Although pregnant people were excluded from the trials, it is always the case that there are people who do not know they are pregnant or who end up getting pregnant unexpectedly.  There were small numbers of pregnant people in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna trials.  We do not have data on the outcomes for those pregnant people yet.  There is a mood within the State to start trials.  It was a matter of balancing risk.  Some felt that pregnant women should be included.  We will just have to wait for the information.  Pregnant women were not prioritised in this list because of the absence of data.

Basically, that will depend on the information which we will get about all the vaccines.  It might turn out, as it did with the hepatitis B vaccines, for example, that there will be different manufacturers and different products but that they will do the same thing.  Although there may be an attempt to vaccinate the same person with doses of the same product, it does not matter because the vaccines are interchangeable and any of them can be used.

It might be that, ultimately, they will be interchangeable and it will not matter, but we do not know that yet.  When it comes down to it, as well, we will be looking at what data we have on the vaccines and what age groups they might be most effective in.  <\/p> <p>  Some of these types of vaccines might be more effective in older people rather than younger people, and we might choose on that basis.

For now, however, we do not have the data to comment on one versus another.  We really only have data, to any extent, on the Pfizer vaccine, a little bit more on the Moderna and then on the AstraZeneca vaccine.  There have been no head-to-head studies on those vaccines.

My fear is that they will use the confusion around the certificate for people who have taken the vaccine.  He might provide some clarity on his thinking with regard to the certificate.  Some airlines have said they will require the certificate to allow the passenger fly.  I would like to hear his thoughts on those two points initially and I will come back in again with a couple of other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#J00100","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I will start with the second part of the Senator's question about the certificate.  Within the work programme we are on the IT infrastructure and so on.  Discussions are under way about the nature of any potential certificate but it is a certificate of vaccination and nothing else.  That is a record of the fact that one has taken the vaccine, the number of doses and the type of vaccine.  There has been a conflation publicly between a vaccination record or certificate and now the immunity passport, which is something quite different, particularly as we do not have anywhere near enough information about the impact of the vaccines on preventing or reducing transmission.  That will come in time.  Throughout this programme, both at national and European level, there was a long discussion on having a simple record of vaccination, whether that be a hard copy or a digital or both, but those discussions have not concluded yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>If I may add to that, and Professor Butler may want to come on this, the information is not available.

On the first point, there is a real risk that premature complacency will set in over these weeks as people, very understandably, see hope on the horizon but, as I said previously, unfortunately, a vaccine simply will not come soon enough to have any positive effect at a population level.  As soon as it is rolled out, it will have a wonderful beneficial protective effective for the individuals who get it in the first instance but we are looking at a number of months before we see a vaccine having a significant effect on how we manage this disease overall in Ireland.  Unfortunately, our messaging will not be changing any time soon.  Whether a vaccine comes next week, the week after or the week after that, the reality is that, unfortunately, for the next number of months we will ask people to continue with all of the basic measures that have been so important over the past year and to which people have been so good at adhering.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's second point, the situation in Northern Ireland is of real concern.  NPHET will meet tomorrow and will consider both that situation and the situation internationally.  The situation internationally over the past number of weeks can only be described as devastating when we look at the number of people in intensive care across Europe and the number of deaths and hospitalisations.  NPHET's primary concern is the situation here in Ireland and while we have avoided to a large extent what has happened internationally over recent weeks, I emphasise again that our situation is very fragile.  We have seen numbers tick up in recent days and the indicators are that, unfortunately, we have bottomed out in terms of it being as good as it was going to get and are beginning to see a deterioration once again.

On the definition of \"key workers\", in the document educated staff such as teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and childcare workers are not defined as a key worker, which seems strange.  They are in a different category, which comes after key workers.  There are many comments online and fun things on Twitter about people being at this or that level on the list but what jumped out at me was our definitions.  How flexible or malleable will they be as we go along or are they set in stone?<\/p> <p>  People aged between 18 and 64 who are living or working in crowded situations will be considered quite high up the list but how will we define that?  How will people be able to prove that they are in that position?  Those can be quite personal details and I am wondering how a person would go about proving that they deserve to be further up the list because of an unfortunate living situation that may be out of their control.  What steps will be taken to deal with that sensitively but also how will that be proven?

There are two factors to this, the first of which is how high the risk is for people who cannot maintain social distancing.  Teachers have done a fantastic job in schools, in that they are able to maintain social distancing.  They are young and in a situation where transmission is not as great a problem as it can be in other settings, but their risk of adverse outcomes is much lower than some of the people who are at higher risk.

Usually, we rely on information from a GP referral letter, from direct contact with the GP on people coming into hospital, their background, their medications and their vaccination history, if it is relevant.  In this case, a great enabler will be the universal health identifier, which is used for e-referrals and school vaccination programmes.

As I said earlier, we want to give certainty to members of the public around this and to manage their expectations in as transparent a way as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Brian MacCraith"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":586,"content":"<p>If it will be mid-February for that cohort, what about healthcare workers?

We are just indicating to the committee that we are working through real data across all of the cohorts and through various potential vaccine arrival schedules.

What has been proven internationally over time is that as important as responding to misinformation - which is clearly very important, as we have seen over the last year in terms of Covid-19 more generally - is ensuring that the basic correct information is put out regularly, transparently, as quickly as we have it to hand and in a form that is digestible for the public.  It needs to be in many different forms because people digest information in many different ways.  As I said earlier, there will be a campaign at national level but at local level elected representatives, GPs, pharmacists, healthcare professionals of all types as well as community organisations and others will have a fundamental role to play in addressing misinformation over the coming months.

Can the witnesses assure us that they will not be pulling front-line staff away from the provision of already-delayed services, such as processing primary medical certificates, to carry out the vaccination programme?<\/p> <p>  I thank Dr. Henry for his clarification on informed consent in the context of vulnerable settings but I ask him to provide us with a copy of the protocol to which he referred.  I also ask him to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that a code of conduct is issued to all of our nursing home settings around the country detailing how they should engage with older people.  Naturally enough, older people are going to start asking questions as soon as the first vaccine is approved.  It is very important that they are not told that they will not have access to X or Y service if they do not avail of the vaccine so that they are giving proper, informed consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#M01200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I will start with the final point first.  We have built up experience in informed consent for vaccination programmes among older people with the pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza vaccine programmes.  Deputy Naughten is correct that they should never involve a threat, direct, indirect or otherwise, and should involve providing information in a way that a person can best understand the benefits and risks.  The principle of informed consent has evolved over the years.  It is not a binary concept.  It is complex.  In this case, it is the duty of the healthcare provider, namely, ourselves, to explain things as best we can, according to each individual situation.  That includes people who may have cognitive impairment.  They should not be excluded from consent just because they are on a journey of cognitive impairment towards dementia.  Our colleagues in nursing and GPs who vaccinate older people have a lot of experience in explaining the benefits of vaccines.  They trust that older people, like younger people, are able to ask for the information that is important to them.  It is obvious to everybody that they have suffered greatly, not just in terms of the impact of the virus, but from the impact of the social restrictions.  I hope we would be leading from the front and providing impartial, correct information to people.  My guess is that based on the optics from the influenza vaccine this season, which has been taken up at very high levels among this age group, we would see a big appetite among older people for a vaccine that would reduce what is a very high risk for some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#N00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Is there a response on the adequacy of the legislation in terms of the unique identifier?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#N00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I asked about the unique identifier amending legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020121600002#N00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Will anyone comment on that?

In this regard I welcome officials from the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications who have joined us here today.  Mr. Fergal Mulligan is the programme director for Ireland's National Broadband Plan and Mr. Patrick Neary is chief technology officer of the Department.  We will look at the National Broadband Plan roll-out and the associated broadband connection points.  As we continue our examination of this critical issue for rural development in Ireland, the reality is that Covid-19 has increased pressure on our mobile and fixed telecommunications networks.  Now, more than ever before, we need to ensure our citizens have access to reliable mobile phone networks as well as the fixed broadband network.  The committee notes that during the recent lockdown one of our fixed broadband or mobile networks went down every second day yet the mobile phone and broadband taskforce established by Government to liaise with the telecom sector did not hold a single meeting to discuss the Covid impact on our telecommunications sector.  The deterioration in these networks must be rectified irrespective of how the public health emergency pans out in 2021, not just to facilitate remoter working which is so essential to employees, employers, families and communities but also to ensure the delivery of new technologies into isolated rural areas.  This includes, for example, Garda drones that cannot only be used for policing activities but illegal practices such as fly tipping, replacing the limited availability of the Garda helicopter and for emergency calls and medical treatment in isolated areas that will require reliable connectivity.<br\/><br\/>Members of the committee and of the Houses have absolute privilege in respect of the statements made to either House of the Oireachtas or before the committee.

My name is Patrick Neary and I am the chief technology officer in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Fergal Mulligan, who is programme director for the National Broadband Plan.  We look forward to discussing these matters with you today.<\/p> <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of high-speed, quality, reliable broadband and mobile coverage to ensure that citizens in rural Ireland can participate in remote working, online schooling, shopping, critical video calls - both business-related and social - and a plethora of other online activities which most now take for granted.<\/p> <p>  With respect to mobile coverage and in order to assist mobile network operators, MNOs, to meet demand and maintain service levels during the pandemic, regulations were made in April under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 enabling ComReg to release additional rights of use for the radio spectrum on a temporary basis.  This framework, established with the consent of the then Minister, enabled mobile network operators to create additional capacity across their mobile networks and accommodate the increased demand which arose earlier this year, particularly in suburban and rural areas.  Licences were issued to the three mobile network operators, Three, Vodafone and Eir, on a temporary basis for three months.  A further temporary licensing framework was put in place in October enabling licences to be issued for three months and ComReg is currently considering applications under this framework to allow licences to continue into March 2021.<\/p> <p>  Also in April this year, the main electronic communications providers signed up to a common set of commitments to assist and help their customers to stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  In light of the pandemic, operators, both fixed and mobile, reviewed their network capacity against the voice and data traffic demand and put in place measures to mitigate the risk of network congestion.  As a consequence, and to the credit of the industry, the networks have remained stable throughout this period with their infrastructure remaining resilient despite being tested in an unprecedented manner.  As members will appreciate, providing telecommunication services, including mobile services, is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by ComReg as independent regulator.<\/p> <p>  As set out by our colleagues from the Department of Rural and Community Development to this committee on 2 December last, the mobile phone and broadband taskforce has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide from the commercial sector.  It has completed over 70 targeted actions to alleviate connectivity barriers and enhance information provided to consumers, and continues to tackle issues impeding the roll-out of essential infrastructure in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  With respect to broadband, of the 2.4 million premises across Ireland, 77% of premises now have access to high-speed broadband of more than 30 Mbps.  National Broadband Ireland, NBI, is now tasked with addressing the remaining premises through the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  In many parts of the country, very high capacity networks are now becoming the norm.  For example, 40% of subscriptions are for services offering speeds in excess of 100 Mbps.  There are more than 225,000 fibre subscriptions across the country, representing a 55% increase on last year.  It is encouraging to note that a number of industry players have announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband.  This includes Eir which has said it will roll out fibre to a further 1.4 million premises, bringing their fibre deployment to some 1.8 million premises.  SIRO is currently completing the first phase of its fibre deployment which will see 375,000 premises passed with gigabit services.  It is actively considering the scope of phase 2 of this project.  Virgin Media is offering 250 Mbps as a standard offering with 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps available to many of their customers across the more than 1 million premises that they cover.  It too is continuing to invest in upgrading its network.  Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.<\/p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Mulligan who will outline the position on the National Broadband Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":615,"content":"<p>As the Chairman knows, the State has stepped in to ensure homes and businesses that are not receiving the reliability required will be assured of such a broadband service.  This will be delivered by the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan.  As the Chairman knows the contract that underpins this commitment was signed in November 2019 with NBI.  NBI is currently well advanced in the design of the network, and it will build and operate this new high-speed, high-quality and reliable broadband network which will see minimum speeds of 500 Mbps available to homes across all of rural Ireland, regardless of how remote those premises may be.  This is a commitment that is unique when compared to many other jurisdictions across the world and, when combined with commercial sector investment, will see over 90% of premises across the State served with speeds in excess of 100 Mbps by 2024, coverage that was unimaginable only five years ago.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s high-speed broadband map shows those premises marked blue.  As the Chairman knows, on our map we have the colours blue and amber, with amber representing the intervention area.  In the blue areas we understand high-speed broadband services are currently available from the commercial sector, based on information from the sector itself.  However, we understand that some homes and businesses have experienced difficulty getting a reliable high-speed broadband service and we are proactively engaged in dealing with any such anomalies to ensure no home or business is left behind.<\/p><p>We are dealing with any such anomalies on a daily basis.  It remains open to the Department to bring additional premises into the National Broadband Ireland, NBI, roll-out plan under the contract where no commercial high-speed broadband service is available from any of the commercial operators.  NBI&rsquo;s roll-out will bring an initial minimum standard 500 Mbps service to all premises in the intervention area.  It should be noted that this represents an increase from the original 150 Mbps contracted this time last year.  <\/p><p> In addition, services of up to 1 Gbps will be available to businesses and other users on request and it is important to note that that is not an \"up-to\" service but is a guaranteed minimum speed.  NBI has made significant progress in 2020 despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is worth noting that to date NBI has surveyed more than 145,000 premises across 26 counties, which continues apace; completed detailed designs for more than 105,000 premises, which is also increasing weekly; installed 220 broadband connection points, which are a key element of the NBP and will provide high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to all of the homes surrounding those broadband connection points, which includes all of the primary schools across the country; and signed contracts with 33 retail service providers who will be selling the services to end-users through the NBI network, which have now directly employed more than 170 people and more than 627 indirectly through its sub-contractors across the country.  In addition, an acceleration to the roll-out of high-speed broadband to some 679 schools across the State by the end of 2022, that is within the next two years, was recently announced.<\/p><p> Build work has started in rural parts of counties Cork, Limerick, Cavan and Galway.  NBI is currently in its test and trial phase where the first commercial connections will be made by the many retail services providers mentioned earlier in early 2021, with the scale of connections to the network ramping up over the new year.<\/p><p> The need for access to high-speed broadband by all has never been clearer.  Recognising this, the programme for Government specifically commits to seek to accelerate the roll-out of the NBP.  The programme also recognises that the NBP will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged, particularly around increased levels of remote working and remote service delivery.<\/p><p> The Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP roll-out to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises that are currently scheduled in the later years six and seven of the current plan.  Any change requires detailed technical, commercial and financial analysis as this is a very complex and significant build of a national network.<\/p><p> NBI has now established a dedicated team to investigate acceleration of the roll-out from its current contracted schedule of seven years and members of my Department are actively working with it on a weekly and daily basis in that regard.  However, the immediate priority is to ensure any delays as a result of Covid-19 experienced to date that might arise in 2021 are mitigated to the greatest extent by NBI to ensure the current roll-out timelines are met.  NBI is working closely with all its build partners to address the many challenges presented by Covid-19.<\/p><p> The Department is aware that concerns have been raised by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications Networks regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network.  We note from that meeting that NBI has undertaken to carry out further work and to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans covering at least the next 18 months and it is expected that this will be available in the new year.  We are hoping to get that done as soon as possible, given the vacuum that seems to be there with the information.<\/p><p> I thank the Committee once again for inviting us and welcome any questions, which we will do our utmost to answer.  Where we do not have an immediate answer, we will be more than happy to respond in writing as soon as possible following this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>Before we bring in members to speak, can Mr Mulligan please go through and explain he pictures on our monitors?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#C00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Yes, of course I will.  We decided that the best way to explain what NBI is doing and in how it is building this network is to show the committee some maps.  Mr. Neary, the resident engineer and chief technology officer in the office, is overseeing the network deployment, will explain that in detail and will set out a number of examples.  These examples are representative of every county, and even though we will show just one county it is representative of every one.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, a couple of key questions that people ask are who decided the places in which the roll-out will happen first, how this works, and are we hitting or cherry-picking areas first so that NBI is getting a better bang for its buck, and so forth?  As Mr. Neary will explain, the network roll-out is divided in to 227 deployment areas up and down the country in every county.  The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the Eircom exchanges or Enet's metropolitan area networks, MANs.  As Mr. Neary will show the committee in a moment, it is not quite as simple as an inward-out process.  Members will see that there are what we call shape files, which are these polygons that represent a deployment area, each being one of the 227.  The blue and yellow deployment areas for Galway and its outskirts represent a deployment area.  I will hand over now to Mr. Neary to explain what those polygons mean and how they are arrived at before one designs something.  <\/p> <p>  The most fundamental point in principle in all of this is that NBI, through the contract, is not deciding on what the build is on the basis of cost or on how easy it is to get there.  This is based on a network design of getting everywhere as fast as possible but within the confines of how rings are built around certain areas to ensure that the fibre rings are there to provide robustness, reliability and resilience.  If, for example, a cable falls over or is broken, all of these networks need to have back-up plans where if one cog in the wheel falls over, 1,000 premises are not then left without broadband.  That is how networks work.  They are done in rings so that the data can go backwards and forwards to the Internet and one point of failure does not bring down the entire network.  Mr. Neary will explain these rings to the committee in terms of fibre build.  <\/p> <p> When one looks at any one of these deployment areas, there is low and high-hanging fruit.  It is non-discriminatory in that regard because there are remote and non-remote premises in every deployment area.  The deployment area, for example, in which I live is at the bottom of a mountain in County Wicklow but I am in the same deployment area as Kilcoole and Greystones, which are urban areas.  I am five miles from the nearest village but it just so happens that I am within the ring of that fibre network.  The homes in my area will be far more expensive to get to than some of the homes in Kilcoole or Greystones and again this depends on particular circumstances, because getting to homes in some urban or semi-urban areas can be quite expensive as it may be all underground or trenching may have to be dug, which will be more expensive than overhead cables that one might bring through rural areas.<\/p> <p>  The plan is not based on cost or any particular economic model but primarily on an engineering model.  Now is a good time for me to stop talking about engineering and to hand over to Mr. Neary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I will introduce a couple of terms to explain the NBI roll-out.  As can be seen from the screen, there are blue and light green polygons.  Each one of these is a deployment area and is akin to an exchange area.  In the centre of that area is the electronic equipment that all of the fibre feeds back to so that it all connects to the Internet in due course.  The electronic equipment is based, typically, in a town or a village and is in an exchange building or it can be a cabinet.  These are referred to in this map as optical line terminals, OLTs.  A deployment area, therefore, is a group of premises, typically around a 25 km radius, where the electronic equipment resides to which the fibre feeds back to.<\/p> <p>  There are 227 deployment areas covering the whole country.  Every area within the intervention area in Ireland is covered by one of these deployment areas.  There are 33 very important deployment areas, which are more important than the others from an engineering perspective.  These are coloured on this map in light green and yellow.  These are the points of handover where another operator can put their own equipment alongside that of NBI and access the network.<\/p><p>Another important part of the hand over of the deployment area is for them to connect back to the main data centres in Dublin that then connect to the international Internet and all the content providers.  There are 33 of those in Ireland and the first step is to deploy them.  Without those in place, the other deployment areas have no connectivity to anything.  They do not connect to the Internet until those 33 areas are in place.  The roll-out strategy is to get the 33 areas in place as quickly as possible and then start building the deployment areas alongside them so they can then connect to the deployment area, which is coloured light green on the map, and back to the Internet through Dublin.<br\/><br\/>The next slide shows a map of Galway.  I am more familiar with County Mayo so Claremorris, for example, is a point of handover location because it has a MAN, which is already connected back to Dublin thus one is reusing an existing structure.  If the NBI places the initial electronic equipment in Claremorris, it can just rent infrastructure back to Dublin, so there is no need to build new infrastructure, and that is already a connection to the Internet, etc.  Claremorris is a good example.  Once the NBI provides its own electronic equipment then anything connected to Claremorris can be connected to the Internet.  The strategy is to connect all of the premises within the Claremorris deployment area.  So that is the first town in that area that will be deployed.  Next is a move to the area beside Claremorris.  In this scenario that means Ballinrobe or Cloonfad.  The reason for doing so is once the NBI deploys its electronic equipment in Ballinrobe, it will be connected to Claremorris, which then goes back to Dublin.  If one were to start in Ballinrobe, the area would not be connected to the Internet.  Ballinrobe would just be an island and would have no connectivity to the Internet unless one starts building back to Dublin.  The quickest way back to Dublin, and in truth to the international Internet, is from Ballinrobe to Claremorris and then back to Dublin. <br\/><br\/>Let us consider the scenario.  One has deployed the Claremorris deployment area so that is now live.  One moves on to Ballinrobe and builds out all of the premises surrounding Ballinrobe so within a 25 km radius of the town, which encompasses every secondary and primary road, and boreens.  So every premises that is in an intervention area will be covered and that is then brought back to Claremorris.  The dark line that we put on the map represents the connectivity between Ballinrobe and Claremorris.  That connectivity is the backhaul between Ballinrobe and Claremorris.  What happens to Claremorris is that all of the surrounding deployment areas are built out in a ring, so there is Ballinrobe, Maum, Liscarney, Castlebar and Cloonfad.  That is really the progress of the deployment.  One will consistently see it built out in a ring and one will see the same in Galway.<br\/><br\/>As Mr. Mulligan mentioned earlier, if there is a break in the backhaul at some point in the ring then one has two options.  Let us say the connectivity between Maum and Claremorris is broken somewhere in Ballinrobe.  The connectivity can go the opposite way on the ring.  The design is clever as it gives resilience and allows the NBI to ensure that the actual service will be very positive for consumers once the NBI gets the ring in place.  There has been a lot of commentary as to why one would not start out, for example, in Liscarney, which is near Westport, and come back.  Until one gets connectivity back to the global Internet then that would be an island on its own.  It is important that the green areas are done first and then everything else will feed from those points of handover.<br\/><br\/>I wish to point out that every premises in each area is covered in a fully coherent way as the build is done.  It is not that the main ones are done before moving on.  Each of the deployment areas can be seen on the NBI website.  There is a cascade of these happening in parallel.  For example, there are 3,500 premises in the Galway point of handover that is marked in a light green colour on the slide shown.  In the surrounding areas surveys and the deployment of structures will be commenced very quickly once the Galway one is <i>in situ.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will explain the service provision, which is the most important aspect from an end-user perspective.  When Claremorris, Ballinrobe and Liscarney are all connected then we call them the premises passed.  The first thing that the NBI must confirm to us is that they are all passed and we can guarantee the 500 Mb service in that ring and within the polygons there.  It is only after the NBI prove that to us that it will get the subsidy under the national broadband contract.  After that it is entirely up to the consumers and businesses whether they want the service from NBI.  Under the contract, once they order the service then the NBI must connect them within a certain number of days or weeks, depending on the connection.<\/p> <p>  As we know, the NBI is only a wholesale network.  So some of the 33 retail service providers will sell services in the areas but that depends on the geography.  For example, Westnet in the west of Ireland is a local small retail service provider.  It is contracted now to offer services over the NBI network and it will offer services to its existing customers and new customers located around Claremorris and those areas.  Similarly, if one goes to Cork, certain operators only operate out of Cork or Limerick so on and so forth.  National providers such as Sky, Vodafone, Eir, Three and Virgin Media also will sell services.  Heretofore, the consumers in these areas may have had the option of using one to three retail broadband providers, which is the most that is available in many rural areas.  In the next few years as this initiative is rolled out consumers can avail of a plethora of retail providers that will offer not only broadband but television and landline buy services, which can also be delivered over fibre and security systems.  Mobile service  companies will probably also bundle mobile services.<\/p> <p>  From the point of view of consumer choice and value for money, in the coming years consumers in rural areas will be given the same choice and options enjoyed by people who live in Dublin, Cork or Limerick where they can walk into a shop or ring an operator and ask for all of its four services to be put on the one bill.  People will probably save a lot of money monthly by doing so because currently in rural Ireland people probably pay separately for a television service, a broadband service, a mobile phone and a landline with Eircom.  These are the benefits that will accrue as this initiative is rolled out around the network.  Not only will there be greater speeds and quality of service, there will be an absolute 24-7 guaranteed service with videos and everything else.  The choice in terms of television and mobiles will spread out in terms of consumers and competition.  The initiative will grow a ubiquitous national network where everybody and every network can sell services whether one lives on an island or on the west or east coasts.  That is the ambition and objective within the next five to seven years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is next.

Before discussing the NBI I wish to ask a few questions about mobile services.  Who decides the policy that licences for mobile services are sold on a population basis to the private sector?<\/p><p>I know ComReg issues the licences.  Who decides the policy, the Minister or the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg?  <\/p><p> Why was this done on a population basis rather than a geographic basis?  My understanding is that covering, say, 90% of the population allows huge areas of countryside with relatively sparse populations to be left out.  On the other hand, I understand that some of the Nordic countries provided operated on a population basis and covered 99% of the population.  Their populations make Ireland look very densely populated.  In the northern Arctic regions the population is very small but the geographic area is huge.  I understand they have something like 99% coverage.  Perhaps the witnesses can explain this and say where responsibility for policy resides.<\/p><p> What is the population coverage requirement for a licence at the moment?  In other words, what population do 4G and 5G licence holders have to cover?  What area coverage does that translate into?  That is very important.  Those are the hard questions people in the areas with no decent signal are asking.  <\/p><p> Regarding National Broadband Ireland, NBI, I have always believed in providing fibre to the home, as long ago as 2011 and 2012.  I am glad speeds have improved from 30 Mbps.  That is historic now.  I welcome the idea that rural Ireland is getting 500 Mbps.  That is fantastic.  The fibre solution is the only solution.  I know there will be exceptions to that but they will be very few and far between.  I have one question in that regard.  The offshore islands have quite dense populations.  I see the Aran Islands are marked on the witnesses' graphic.  How will they be connected to the mainland?  Will there be a fibre cable connection or a wireless radio connection? <\/p><p> There is another question that everybody is asking.  At the moment, when users connects to the Internet and enter their eircode they are either served or told they are in the NBI area.  It is very black and white.  No indication is given of whether service will be available in five years, six years or whatever.  When will indicative dates be available?  In all fairness, Eir did this.  There was slippage of months, but not of years.  When will there be some indication of when this will be carried out?  Presumably those responsible already know.  <\/p><p> The witnesses say the contract runs for six or seven years from this time last year.  Has one year of the contract elapsed?  Could that be reduced to five years from this time last year, that is, four years from now?  That is becoming absolutely critical.  These centres are fine, but they do not replace what people are looking for.  They want connections in their homes and businesses. <\/p><p> We have been told the cost of the NBI last year.  I have always believed it was worth pursuing one way or the other.  I went against my own party on this because I thought it made a mistake.  It was costing &euro;2.9 billion, but I understand that included a big contingency.  Given what happened this spring in relation to fibre connections to the 300,000 Eir premises, am I right in thinking that there could be a very substantial drop in cost?  That was contingent on a very low take-up which has probably already been exceeded in the Eir coverage area.  <\/p><p> I am trying to keep my questions very specific.  Do we have figures for the current take-up of fibre in the Eir deployment area, which is almost equivalent?  Did Eir cover the full area the company said it would cover, that is, the 300,000 houses and premises?  I thank the Chair for his indulgence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#D00400","speaker":"1575","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I will let the Deputy comment again when other members have contributed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#E00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked about two areas.

Obviously the Minister could direct ComReg in that respect.  The coverage obligations are set out and awarded by ComReg.  The multi-band spectrum award that was conducted in 2012 set out the main obligations that apply today.  They were set across three main spectrum bands.  They obligated operators to provide 70% coverage by population.  That was in 2012.  Since then there has been an award of 3.5 GHz spectrum in 2017.  Ireland became the first country in Europe to award 5G spectrum at that time.  It was awarded in nine different areas, five urban and four rural.  That was done on a site basis.  There was an obligation for several sites to be deployed within a three-year timeline.  Ireland has been the European forerunner in 5G deployment, granting an award in 2017 and seeing the fruits of that now.<\/p> <p>  The target for 5G deployment in Europe called for deployment in one major city in Ireland.  5G services are available in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The target was to put main thoroughfares in place and to launch 5G in the countryside.  Some three operators have fully launched a 5G service to some extent.  <\/p> <p>  I would like to direct the members' attention to the State's next major award, which will be the multi-band spectrum award in 2021.  It represents an increase of almost 450% in the spectrum available for operators.  ComReg is currently finalising the details of the obligations which will go with that.  The obligations currently envisioned by ComReg for that auction include 99% population coverage, 92% geographical coverage, coverage of motorways and primary roads and specific obligations around voice quality.  The obligations also include the requirement to cover specific locations, including hospitals, educational campuses, ports and airports and 42 tourist visitor locations.  The next award will have a very different emphasis to the 2012 award.  That is the direction of travel where spectrum awards are concerned.  That award is still being finalised and is due to be granted in the first half of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":630,"content":"<p>Mr. Neary might come back to the committee at a later stage on the ComReg report that was produced, wherein it was asked specifically by the Minister to look at 5G coverage on a geographical basis.

The Deputy asked about eircodes and timing of connections over the last seven years.  We all understand that the biggest bugbear for people in rural Ireland is needing to know when they are getting their connections and they need to know that from the NBI website.  They do not want to be told they could be in whatever year.  That is a major frustration.  NBI was in front of the previous Oireachtas committee on communications and it was told in no uncertain terms that the information out there at the moment is not sufficient.  It has made a commitment and it is working very hard on that.  We have had meetings with NBI about improving its website and improving the visibility of eircodes, as well as premises that do not have eircodes.  At the moment it is telling us that it can provide visibility for the next 18 months.  We have told it that that probably is not good enough.  It is certainly not good enough for anybody beyond the 18 months because they still will not know.<br\/><br\/>NBI has a challenge in that, if people are in years four, five, six or seven, it is very difficult to give them much clarity on exactly what month or even what quarter they will get a connection because the network design has not been done yet.  The stuff Mr. Neary has just shown the committee on the network deployment is subject to a lot of variables in terms of interaction with Eircom or Enet, the points of handover and all those different things, on which NBI works on a yearly basis within that seven years.  While it is a work in progress, everybody is absolutely clear that there is an information deficit.  Everybody wants to have more information.  The people who are within the 18 month period will be getting absolute clarity.  The way it works is that NBI will be able to give people clarity on what quarter they are in 18 months out.  At six months out, it will be able to tell them what month and then a month before the premises is ready to be serviced people will probably have a plethora of retail providers banging on their doors looking to connect them.<br\/><br\/>Over this Christmas period and into the new year, NBI is going directly out to about 19,000 of the premises in the initial five deployment areas we mentioned, which are under construction.  Some 19,000 people are being told that they will get a fibre connection by April.  Many of those premises will get a connection in February, March and April.  That is 19,000 people who have absolute clarity on when they are getting their connections.  The other 80,000 or 90,000 in the next tranche will have very good visibility.  For example, I am hopefully going to get a connection in the third or fourth quarter of next year.  That information is good for people in my area because one knows that it will happen in 2021.  NBI appreciates that it is not all about just the month, the day or the week.  People just want to know what time on the horizon it is at all.  We are working on NBI giving information for people who are in 2021 and 2022, and 2023 if possible.  Beyond that, it is a real challenge.  The challenge is twofold insofar as we could end up telling people they are in year seven but hopefully we will get them back into year four or year five.  It would be a mistake to tell people that they are in year seven if we can bring them forward, and that is the ambition.<br\/><br\/>That comes to the Deputy' next question on whether we can make this go faster.  The ambition is to give people as much information as possible.  I am optimistic that NBI will have a much better website in the new year and I am optimistic about the communications channels it is using in parallel to the website.  This is very difficult in the Covid environment but it is going to every local authority and every stakeholder, be it Irish Rural Link or the Oireachtas.  It needs to go to every stakeholder across rural Ireland and communicate to them what is happening, like Mr. Neary did for Galway.  It must do that in every area and that is what it is doing.  NBI was in Clare this week with the local authority there going through all this and it has already been in a number of other local authorities.  That is a work in progress.  If Covid-19 had not happened, the contract required NBI to do town hall events and go through the country with road shows and explainers and everything else but again, those personal events were not possible.  When restrictions are lifted that road show will start again.  The NBI team would be heavily engaged in that and it has a big team involved in the communications area.  Let us wait and see how the next few months go.  We in the Department are putting a lot of pressure on NBI on behalf of the Oireachtas to get that information out there.  We are working closely with it and we have a communications team on both our side and its side who are working diligently on that.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked when the contract period started.  The effective date was 9 January 2020.  That is when it started and when it all kicked off.  We signed it on 19 November 2019 and the effective date was 9 January 2020.  The seven years started from January 2020.  Contract year one is until the end of this coming January, and so on and so forth for the next seven years.  NBI is contracted to build this network within seven years.  Every deployment plan has to be done within that seven years and there are clear milestones set out in the contract.  The ask is whether it can it be brought forward.  There is clear ambition in the programme for Government to seek to accelerate this roll-out insofar as possible and in particular to bring those people in years 7 and 6 and those most in need forward.  Some people are reasonably satisfied with their broadband service but there are many people who are not and they cannot function or work remotely.<br\/><br\/>That is where the broadband connection points, BCPs, with all their faults, come in.  They can help farmers who might want to buy and sell at farmers' marts if they cannot do it from home or can be used if people want to upload or download videos, or an architect wants to upload or download designs.  There are now BCPs within reasonable proximity of every premises in the country where heretofore there were not.  By the end of this year there will be more than 200 of them in community halls, parish halls and other community centres.  The Michael Cusack centre was opened in Clare last Friday and according to <i>digiclare.ie<\/i>, instead of four digital hubs Clare County Council now has seven or eight.  Again, that is with the benefit of NBP wind behind it.  We have now 75 schools connected which heretofore were not and 690 will be connected by the end of 2022.<br\/><br\/>A huge amount of progress is being made and that communications machine is ramping up and getting better, getting the message out there about what is happening, where it is happening and when.  I cannot say at the moment whether we can bring it forward from seven years because there is a massive amount of work to get around to be able to say with any clarity that we can bring this forward by a year or two.  There are many people working hard on that as we speak within my team, within the NBI team and with their partners because NBI cannot do this without their partners, be they Eir, ESB, or other network providers.  Many people are in discussions around what can be done to make this process faster.  That is absolutely on the radar.  We hope to have positive news on that in the next quarter or two but it would be a dereliction of my obligations to say I can absolutely do that because that would be setting false expectations at this stage.  When we know more we will absolutely let people know and it is a top priority of the Government to get this done quicker. <br\/><br\/>The final question Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked was on the subsidy.  The gross amount approved by the Government was &euro;2.9 billion.  At the time, that included &euro;355 million of VAT.  The Revenue Commissioners have since confirmed to us that at least &euro;250 million of that is no longer applied so &euro;250 million of the &euro;2.9 billion is no longer relevant.  The &euro;2.9 billion was brought to the Government in 2019 based on a prudent estimate of what the VAT might be but since then we have gotten clarification from the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of that VAT is not relevant to the NBP and the Department's Vote.  The &euro;480 million, which was a contingency pot on top of the &euro;2.1 billion, has not been drawn down.<\/p><p>We are optimistic and hopeful that a large majority of that will not be required or necessary but, again, we are only in year one of a seven-year build, so it would be premature to say where we will be in five years time on that.  At the moment, as Peter Hendrick, the CEO of NBI stated at the last Oireachtas committee meeting, he is very confident it will remain on time and within budget, and the budget at the moment is &euro;2.1 billion.  If it requires drawdown of contingencies, there are very strict rules and parameters within the contract as to the basis on which it can do that.<\/p><p> We are all reasonably optimistic that that will happen.  The pandemic, for all its ills and all the carnage it has created, has given some breathing space to NBI insofar as the commercial investment that might otherwise have been going on in fibre build is not happening, and there is more capacity with fibre build network contractors and fibre materials and so on.  I hope that will be to the benefit of the cost of the project.  It is certainly not something that has seen any cost overruns so far and that is certainly not something we see happening in the short to medium term.  We are quite optimistic on that front.  Hopefully, I will be sitting here in five or six years time with a clear picture on that because we will know an awful lot more.  That is the story on the subsidy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":635,"content":"<p>If people knew it was starting in Claremorris and going to Cloonfad or Ballinrobe next, it would make a big difference and at least people would know where they are on that list.

More rural parts of the constituency are in the yellow section but there are also sections of the map, for areas like Cruiserath and Ballycoolin, where there are small yellow dots, and I suppose they are the individual houses or units within that area which are not covered by broadband.  I find this interesting because 99% of Dublin West is covered and is marked in blue on the map.  In addition, a number of data centres, to which the witnesses referred, are in Dublin West and a couple of others are being built, even as we speak.

What I would recommend, and I would recommend this to any Deputy, is to reach out to NBI, and I believe NBI is actively reaching out to Deputies, Senators and councillors to give them that information in the best way it can.<\/p> <p>  On the BCPs, if it is pending, it will be live in the coming months, I would imagine.  Vodafone is to go live with those.  To explain the BCPs, the first BCP was launched in Dublin by the Ministers, Deputy Ryan and Deputy Humphreys, not so long ago.  NBI builds the connection and it brings the actual high-speed broadband connection to the side of the wall of the building.  Our colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development have a contract with Vodafone, and Vodafone goes live in each BCP and provides outdoor coverage and indoor coverage.  Within the BCPs in the Dublin area and every other county, residents and others can get broadband within 40 m of that building at 150 Mb, and they can also get it internally, obviously.  The benefit of outside is that if, at the weekend, for some reason, a person needs to do something they cannot do at home, they can go up to that building, although they would want to check the opening times, whether the car park is open and whether it is actually available, as every BCP is separate and bespoke, and it is up to the owners of the site what they do.  I cannot remember exactly how many BCPs are in Dublin but I know there are two in north Dublin and Fingal, and my understanding is they will all be done very shortly in the new year.  That is a big bonus to anyone living in that area if they need to use it.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure I quite understood the question on the State infrastructure and the subsidy, but retailers will be buying access to the NBI network on a monthly basis at, say, &euro;30 per month, which is pegged to the regulated rate that Comreg oversees with Eircom for a wholesale provider service.  It allows them to sell the same retail service to consumers in north Dublin, north Donegal or anywhere across the country at the same level.  Therefore, generally, a bundle of broadband and television in Dublin might cost &euro;50, &euro;60 or &euro;70, and it will be the same across the country when this is built because the wholesale input will be the same to all the retailers.<\/p> <p>  With regard to 5G masts and towers, I might pass that question to Mr. Neary.  In terms of connection, if the 5G towers are built and there is no connection, NBI is allowed, subject to very strict state aid criteria, to offer backhaul to mobile broadband providers with mobile masts across the country if there is a deficit in the commercial sector.  Most masts and towers would be connected by other commercial companies with backhaul, like Eircom, Enet and so on, but subject to strict state aid rules.  NBI, which is a commercial company too, may in certain circumstances be able to offer mobile backhaul as well, and it is certainly part of its job jar to do.  Certainly, where there is a deficit in fibre backhaul, its job across the country is to do that, and there are lots of towers and masts in Coillte forests across the country, and so on.  Where it is commercial for NBI to do that, it can go and do it, but we do not subsidise that part.  We do not subsidise mobile backhaul; we only subsidise the fibre connection to the home.<\/p> <p>  In terms of future proofing, we had this debate long and hard for the last couple of years before the contract was signed in regard to whether fibre will become a thing of the past when 5G is rolled out, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v probably has an opinion on that.  We on this side of the table see that all ships are rising because the data usage growth of consumers and businesses is exponential, and there is no one-size-fits-all and no one network that is going to outdo another network.  Fibre is critical to every network, including 5G, and the ultimate test of the networks is how much fibre backhaul they have out there and what capacity can bring all that data and video down.  As members can see from the ComReg stats, year on year, the double-digit growth in data for mobile and fixed means we will need to have loads of fibre across the country, and the NBI build is bridging that gap in rural Ireland.  The fibre to the home, the mobile 5G, the Internet of Things, and all those things people talk about in the home and in business, will be underpinned by that fibre going to that building, but we will still need a 5G network for outdoor coverage for cars, machines and that sort of thing.  Perhaps Mr. Neary can come in on that as he would be the expert on 5G and can explain what that is going to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Many solutions are being brought to the market and they are almost like a tapestry in that they complement each other to a great extent.  5G mobile would be an outdoor connectivity for on-the-move, outdoor coverage while the NBP deployment is targeting indoor WiFi, essentially to ensure people have broadband in their house, so they can be very complementary services.

I will not bother asking about the acceleration.  It is important but, clearly, they are not in a position at this stage of the process to answer.  Nevertheless, given that there is a commitment in the programme for Government, people naturally want to see it happen.<\/p> <p>  Covid has had a big impact, resulting in many delays.  On the other side of that, it has led to a ramping up of the need for broadband roll-out.  There is a need for acceleration, given that more people will be relying on remote working.<\/p> <p>  I assume it is envisaged that the broadband connection points will continue to be rolled out while the broadband programme progresses.  How many connection points are due next year?  Is it still the case that people can apply for those connections?  Is it envisaged that that will continue for the next while?<\/p> <p>  Of the 679 schools in the State that will be connected by the end of 2022, is there a breakdown of where they will be or how that has been decided?<\/p> <p>  A question that I am sure that many Deputies and Senators are asked relates to when someone enters an eircode postcode and is told that he or she is in an intervention area.  Many people have asked me when County Roscommon or County Galway, for example, will be rolled out.  Mr. Mulligan stated that build work has started in rural parts of Cork, Limerick, Cavan and Galway.  Is there somewhere that states when it is coming to Roscommon, Sligo and Mayo?  When people look at the website, they want to know when broadband will be provided.  I appreciate that it is difficult at this stage, but is a breakdown of the roll-out per county available anywhere?  It is also an issue for people who might be considering signing a contract with a private company, if they do not feel that the broadband will come to them quickly enough even though they will be signing up to 12 or 24-month contracts.<\/p> <p>  I assume that for those people who sign up to a private provider and enter into a contract, broadband will still be made available to them.  Where a company is in place and is providing it, will the customer have the option to move on to the national broadband plan when it is rolled out to the area?<\/p> <p>  For the build work that has started in Cork, Limerick, Cavan and Galway, do the witnesses have any idea how long each phase will take?  How long will the build work in each of those areas take to progress to the next area?<\/p> <p>  In respect of the website, other members asked about the time frame, and of course that is important.  The language is also an issue.  When people input their Eircode postcode, they may be told they are in an intervention area.  People often ask what that means.  The website may also state that the premises is pending a survey, and while there is an option to keep oneself up to date, I have found that people read the language and do not know what it means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#H00200","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Covid has, undoubtedly, had an impact on the speed of the roll-out over the course of the past 12 months.  Since January, National Broadband Ireland, in fairness to it, has set up a new company in very difficult circumstances.  It now has more than 170 people working directly for it, with more than 700 working throughout the country.  Hiring people in a Covid environment is a feat in itself, given that it started with virtually nobody in January, apart from the 30 or 40 people involved in the bid.  It has struggled to meet the demands of Covid, as everybody has, but it has met that challenge pretty well.<\/p> <p>  Even with the BCP roll-out, islands and GAA halls were shut down and staff could not get in to connect them.  That impacted the whole timeline that it had showed us in late 2019.  It had to work around all that and, in fairness, did so very well.  To answer the question on BCPs, the roll-out is on time and on track.  Initially, when the contract was signed, we had an ambition to get 300 of them connected in 2020.  That has been achieved, whereby 274 or 275 will be done within the first contract year.  The difference between that figure and the 300 is due to local authorities changing ones in and out where site owners decided they did not need one or want one, or that the conditions of getting it did not interest them, or that it was not a suitable site.  Things happen.<\/p> <p>  It is a flexible and dynamic list, which also goes to the Deputy's question about whether it can be changed.  It absolutely can be.  Where there are good sites that could help the problem of the year five, six and seven roll-out in any particular county, we are all ears, as is NBI, to see whether there is a good site that we can get a connection to that would help those local residents.  If there is a reasonable business case for helping people in that regard, the door is open to considering those sites.  We will consider it and talk to NBI and the Department of Rural and Community Development about doing that.  That Department is the first point of contact with the local authority to engage on those sites.  A broadband officer in each local authority engages with local communities, as do the community officers in local authorities.  It is through that funnel, into the Department and back to us in NBI, that those BCPs are selected.<\/p> <p>  The schools are selected by the Department of Education and, therefore, we liaise directly with it.   The 690 schools we are targeting for next year comprise every primary school that remains outstanding, so that was an easy choice.  As for the selection of who will get what first, we are in discussions with the Department about which schools' resources are really bad, and we are prioritising them.  Some schools' resources are really bad, while those of others are not so bad, but they will nonetheless be dealt with in 2021 and 2022.<\/p> <p>  The BCP programme has gone very well under the conditions that we have faced with Covid-19.  We announced only last week the acceleration of the schools project, because many of those 690 schools were not due for another four or five years, so that was a really welcome development.  NBI is putting that project plan together and getting its partners involved to get those schools connected, working closely with the Department of Education.<\/p> <p>  On the Eircode postcodes and whether we have a breakdown of the roll-out, it goes back to my earlier point.  For the next 18 months, there is a good level of information on the website.  I take the Deputy's point about the language used.  Following on from meetings of the previous Oireachtas committee on communications, NBI is conscious of that and now has many people working on how we can communicate better, how the wording can communicate better and how the presentation of the website can communicate better.  We have asked for a county-by-county website.  We have a national website from NBI but it should be broken down by county.  It should show people maps and use language they can understand.  That is our ask of NBI, following the ask of the committee at a previous meeting.  NBI has many people working on that and I have been told we can expect something on that front in January.  Hopefully, something new will be on the website very soon, including different language.  I know what an intervention area means because I have been working on the subject for seven years but nobody else knows.  NBI needs to be careful about such issues because it is not experts who use the website but rather ordinary people who want to know when they will get broadband.<\/p> <p>  On the private providers, if somebody who is signed up with, say,  Eircom, Westnet or a local Wicklow broadband provider happens to be in contract, that is a discussion between the customer and the provider.  Wicklow Broadband, Regional Broadband etc. are some of the 33 providers that are signed up with National Broadband Ireland, which means they want to migrate their customers from the wireless network to the fibre network.  They will do that if the consumer wants them to do that.  Ultimately, it is for consumers to put their hand up to say that NBI is in their area and that their premises are passed with fibre, and that they would now like fibre connections.  The consumer's first port of call is the existing provider, probably to ask whether he or she can be moved to that broadband connection.  NBI cannot act in a discriminatory manner and will treat the smallest wireless operators the same as it will treat the largest operator.  Under the contract, it cannot differentiate between the two or treat anybody favourably.  It has an obligation not to discriminate.<\/p> <p>  Nevertheless, the answer is \"Yes\".  If someone is tied in to a contract with a wireless provider for a year or two years, there are circumstances where he or she may have to wait until the contract is expired or may have to take the cost of getting out of the contract if he or she really needs fibre.  That is just the dynamic of the market and it is what happens throughout Ireland with all the operators.  Currently, many people take out one or two-year contracts.<\/p> <p>  I hope that answered most of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I think I might feel more confused than I was before I came to the meeting.  There is a lot going on.  I will begin with some general questions before asking some more specific ones.  I want to get a clear picture.  The roll-out of the national fibre broadband plan is based on the 33 MANs.  How many of those 33 are in place and how many have yet to be built?  Will they use existing infrastructure owned by private phone companies?<\/p><p>How is it working?  It is not just the State paying all of these private companies loads of money to do everything.  What is the balance?  In some ways if these MANs are going to be built it is giving these options to the private companies also because retail services were mentioned.  What is the relationship with the private companies and the Government in this realm?  We all know the mobile phone companies are fleecing us all to death even for bad quality broadband.  At present, how many people in Ireland have no reliable broadband?  I do not.  How many of the 33 MANs are in place?  Is there a commitment to equality of service?  I presume if people have fibre broadband that is it and they have good quality, end of story.  Is this <i>ipso facto<\/i>and can it be taken for granted?<br\/><br\/>If the big plan is to roll out fibre broadband everywhere, what is the big thing with 5G?  We have been told that fibre broadband is needed.  The 5G is to take care of the external issue only and fibre broadband is to take care of all of the internal domestic requirements in buildings.  That is it.  How does 5G rely on fibre broadband?  It is not connected.  It is that one is for indoor and the other is for outdoor.  I was a bit confused about that.<br\/><br\/>NBI is the private company that got the big gig and the onus is on it to do it right.  It got the big gig so the Department can dictate to it on certain issues.  For instance, when I go onto its home page and put in my eircode it tells me my premises is in the intervention area and my locality and infrastructure will be surveyed.  Is it still carrying out surveys?  It is very hard to make a plan when not everything is surveyed.  I was assured we had moved on from the surveying phase.<br\/><br\/>The website also lists the nearest broadband connection points and it has two that are 16 km and 14 km away from me.  One is the Michael Cusack Centre, on which my father cut the ribbon as he was chair of the group.  What is interesting is the website does not list the Wi-Fi hubs.  What is that about?  There is a Wi-Fi hub 8 km from me.  It is part of DigiClare.  If the Department is going to pay the company a lot of money for a good website can it please make sure the information is accurate?  The website tells me I have to go 16 km to my closest broadband connection point.  Of course, the whole thing with broadband connection points and remote Wi-Fi hubs is that there is more jargon that confuses people.  Why are the digihubs not listed on the website?  They could be much closer to people than broadband connections points.  This is important because if we can get broadband we can get people living in rural Ireland again.<br\/><br\/>Is the company looking at all existing fibre broadband infrastructure?  Eir came to the village 5 km from me but nobody outside the village can access it.  Even if we promise to dig up the road and put in the cable ourselves we are not allowed to do so.  Is NBI looking at all of the existing infrastructure?  When we are rolling out fibre broadband can we do it in line with other infrastructure being put in place?  We see all over Ireland roads being dug up, then somewhat put back in place and then they are dug up again.  There has to be joined up thinking between NBI, the Government, all of the mobile phone companies and other infrastructure through the local authorities.  I am glad the Department is meeting the local authorities.<br\/><br\/>Are the schools being connected through fibre broadband?  Is it 5G?  How do we find out when a school will get it?  What is the roll-out plan?  Is there a proper plan in place?  I worked with schools and it is great to see them getting it.<br\/><br\/>With regard to these data centres that will be built all over Ireland, we have heard about the MANs, the feedback and the handover.  The MANs were made to sound quite archaic, with the web structure going back in to be handed over to the big guys and out to Europe.  The data centres also do this.  Will there be an improved quality of service if people just have to go to a data centre in the town near them?  Are there any pluses for us getting these data centres?  There are plans to have one in Ennis and we are wondering what is going on with it.<br\/><br\/>When fibre broadband is being rolled out and the data centres approved by the Government are being built, is the Department looking at the carbon footprint of it all?  Are there any offsets for this?  Every committee has to look at the sustainable development goals.  It is 2020 and there is a climate emergency as well as a broadband emergency.

They are managed by a company called Enet and they have been built.  To answer some of the Senator's questions, and it is part of the Enet solution, one of the tenets of the contract negotiating process of recent years, which is inbuilt in the contract, is the requirement to reuse existing infrastructure.  We are not duplicating, overlaying or redigging roads where we should not.  Eir, which owns the national pole and duct network and has exchanges throughout the country, and Enet, which manages the MANs in many towns throughout the country, have, therefore, built infrastructure.  National Broadband Ireland is under contract using them as partners, which we call subcontractors, and it has these contracts in place since last November.  It was part of the contract with the Government that it had to have them in place.  It has a 25-year agreement with Eir and Enet to use all of these.<\/p> <p>  The basic infrastructure is in place in terms of poles and ducts.  NBI's job is, with Eircom, to replace bad or old poles that have been there 40 or 50 years throughout rural Ireland and fix broken ducts.  Then NBI will get contractors to put in new fibre because the fibre does not exist.  This is the new piece.  The new piece of the jigsaw is the fibre cable.  The exchanges all exist so they are not being rebuilt.  The only new piece of this jigsaw is new equipment that comes from Nokia.  Nokia is deploying its boxes of equipment throughout the country because that is what lights the fibre.  The fibre cable does nothing on its own.  It requires a box on either end of it, in the home and at the exchange, to make the 500 Mb work.  If people want to go to 1 Gb things in the boxes are switched and it goes to 1 Gb.<\/p> <p>  The primary context here is that the money from the State is going on the pieces of the jigsaw that are not already there.  NBI rents the pieces of the jigsaw that are already there from Enet and Eir.  The analogy is that the house is built and we are doing up the house and renting it.  That is exactly what we are doing here.  We are making sure the house stands up for the next 25, 40 or 50 years.  NBI has an obligation to upgrade the house and maintain it and make sure it is working.  This is the contract.<\/p> <p>  The relation between the State and National Broadband Ireland is that NBI is a commercial company and we have a contract with the State for 25 years.  Mr. Neary and I, together with a large team in the Department, oversee the contract.  We make sure NBI sticks to the contract it signed last November.  We can vary the contract through change controls and all that good stuff.  Where it becomes difficult is if those changes we want it to engage in cost more money than it envisaged at the time of the contract.  That is where we would get into a difficult conversation.  There are many things we can ask it to do that do not cost more money.  We have already made changes, for example, the acceleration of the schools project was a change we made and it will go ahead.  These negotiations go on all the time.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked how many people do not have broadband at present.  The short answer is that everybody in Ireland, bar a very small percentage, has basic broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Reliable broadband.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#J01000","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":654,"content":"<p>We are dealing with 544,000 premises, which is more than 20% of the population of Ireland.  There are almost 2.4 million premises in Ireland and we are dealing with more than 540,000 of them as well as all new homes.  We expect that over the next 25 years there will be an additional 60,000 or 80,000 new homes throughout rural Ireland.  NBI will be effectively dealing with more than 600,000 homes over the next 25 years and they are all part of the contract.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked whether fibre is guaranteed.  Under our contract it is.  Many providers will provide fibre and it still may be an \"up to\" service.  Under the contract, NBI is not allowed to offer an \"up to\" service.  It is required under contract to provide a fast reliable minimum speed of 500 Mb and whatever they tell the customers they are getting.  From our perspective, it is guaranteed under the contract.  I cannot speak for other companies in the market.  Generally, if fibre is going directly from the exchange to the home it is as good as can be got in terms of broadband.  It is future-proofed and can be upscaled.  The fibre cable will last forever, barring storms or other such occurrences.  The equipment can always be upgraded and that upgrade can take it from 500 Mb to 1,000 Mb to 10 Gb using the same cable.  It will last forever.  With regard to what its role is with 5G, fibre will be brought to masts and towers.  We have a plethora of masts and towers throughout the country.<\/p><p>Some of them do not have fibre cable to them.  They are using point-to-point links, which are resilient wireless networks, but fibre is a better network to bring to them.  It provides more capacity and resilience given weather conditions and what not.  There are economies of scale and scope for fibre networks as well.  The more fibre there is across the country, the cheaper it might be to use those networks and consumers and businesses benefit.<\/p><p> Regarding the nearest broadband connection points, BCPs, in County Clare, there is an issue with BCPs generally across the country.  BCP is the term we use but I will just use the terms Wi-Fi hubs and digital hubs.  Our colleagues from the Department of Rural and Community Development were at a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago and they talked about that.  The Department, in conjunction with local authorities and other partners, has a working group in place to look at digital hubs across the country.  We are only dealing with digital hubs in the remotest areas.  There is a digital hub initiative across the country.  I think there are up to 1,000 digital hubs across the country but we are dealing with approximately 200 in our plan.  There is an initiative now to bring all of those together.  The Western Development Commission is doing significant work on that front.  It is seeking to develop a website to act as a catch-all for digital hubs so that DIGICLARE does not stand on its own and one would have to go to the DIGICLARE website to see the four or five BCPs there, but one will see everything in County Clare, be it in towns, villages or in rural areas, and the same will be true for Donegal, Roscommon and everywhere else.  That is a work in progress.  The commission has been working on it all this year.  Stephen Carolan and Deirdre Frost in the Western Development Commission have done significant work.  I am optimistic that in the next 12 months a lot more will come out of that, and consumers and businesses will know exactly where it is at.  I think the commission is looking at a website where one can book a table or desk online, regardless of where one is.  A tourist or a person who wants to work in a hub will be looking at an Airbnb-type facility for someone who is going on holidays in Donegal who needs a hub to work in every two days.  We hope the website will be available.<\/p><p> I think I answered the question on schools.  Some schools will be done with fibre in the coming years.  Others will be done with wireless rather than have them waiting for fibre for four or five years.  We have brought it forward and we are going to give them a point-to-point resilient wireless connection for an interim period until we get the fibre.  There is a mixture of wireless and fibre, but the broadband connection is very good and reliable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":656,"content":"<p>I understand what is happening, but I was looking for a timescale for it.

There will not be any issue with data centres.  Mr. Neary might come in on the data centres if he wants to offer any more on them.<\/p> <p>  The impact on the carbon footprint is manifold.  First, people are not travelling.  Second, fibre networks are very efficient networks, far more efficient than the old copper networks.  I saw one report which said a fibre network could be up to 80% more efficient in energy consumption than a copper network.  That is true in general in respect of international travel, local travel and all the rest that goes with it in terms of the footprint.<\/p> <p>  The question is if people will need big offices in cities and towns or if we will have smaller offices and people will be working from home.  The network straddles the environment of economics and the reduction in carbon emissions.  Once we have a ubiquitous national fibre network, that will be the platform.  The aeroplanes will fly off the platform eventually.

Basically, the higher frequencies find it more difficult to get through walls and insulation.  The lower frequencies penetrate walls more easily.  Sticking to 5G, the frequency that was released in 2017 is 3.5 GHz.  That is quite a high frequency.  It is probably medium.  That would struggle somewhat to get through walls but the 5G frequency that is going to be released next year is 700 MHz.  That would penetrate walls a bit better.  Ultimately, however, once the frequency hits a second wall it starts to diminish anyway.  Wi-Fi calling will have a big impact once there is a Wi-Fi service.  The NBP will have a big impact on how reliable the Wi-Fi service will be in rural areas.  Once people have the Wi-Fi in place, they will be able to make high-quality calls.

We will have 33 retailers that will sell to anyone who wants the product in an intervention area.  The packages will be the same as those available in urban areas.  The price control is effectively achieved by a cap on the wholesale price, on which retailers will make their margin.  It is very heavily controlled.  The wholesale price is pegged to the regulated price of Eircom.  Effectively, ComReg does a lot of work on determining the price Eircom should charge and an affordable price, and then we say to NBI that it can charge no more than that.  Then Sky, Vodafone and all the rest of them can say that they can sell what they would sell in Dublin everywhere in Ireland.  Generally, retail companies do not differentiate between one area and another; they just want a blanket approach.  They want to sell their television package, such as Sky Sports, across the country.  The want to advertise just one price nationally.  That is what will happen when the network is fully rolled out but, of course, all the large and small operators will be looking at the areas bit by bit and will probably be doing local advertising before national advertising.  From that point of view, there is tight control.<\/p> <p>  The other main point, which is more important, is that we have very tight control over what people are charged to get a connection.  NBI is required under the contract to provide a connection to every home.  It does not have a choice, and it can only charge a maximum of &euro;100.  Most retailers, or some, may charge nothing while others pass on the charge to the consumer.  This is important because the challenge we have seen with fixed networks, including Eircom and Virgin Media, is that getting into the home is very difficult.  It can be very costly.  There is no contract with the providers to make sure the consumer gets a connection.  Sometimes a company such as Virgin Media, Eircom or another might say it is just too expensive to connect the customer.  In that instance, NBI and the national broadband plan step in.  If a customer cannot get a reliable high-speed broadband connection from a commercial company, that customer should be amber on our map. If the location is blue on the map and the customer cannot get a connection, that is something we are not aware of, provided it is not above 30 Mb.  If one can get above 30 Mb, one is in a blue area, as long as one can get the connection at a reasonable price or one is willing to pay a lot of money for it.  Some might do that.  We have a lot of control in the contract in this area.<\/p> <p>  The splitting of villages, which Deputy Naughten mentioned, is an ongoing issue.  Eir, ComReg and NBI have been in and a constant theme has concerned premises right beside those in the blue areas.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said that somebody might be able to get 100 Mb or 1,000 Mb while somebody across the ditch may not be able to get anything.  It is asked why the fibre is not going all the way.  The answer is that Eircom has built the network and a network design whereby the service just stops at a certain point and cannot go any further.  It has been asked over the past four or five years by many stakeholders whether it can go a bit farther.  In the majority of cases, if not all, Eircom has said it just cannot.  I believe Ms Carolan Lennon, managing director of Eircom, was before the committee and said it is the responsibility of NBI to connect the affected customers.  The problem is that there is a big time gap before the person who does not have the service is connected.  It just keeps coming back to the issue of our needing to get the information out better.  Those in blue areas probably should get the service quicker.  As is evident on the map Mr. Neary showed members, the fibre will be going past the people in blue areas in Claremorris to those in adjoining amber areas so they should be getting a fibre connection quicker than people over in Liscarney or Maam, for example.  Someone in Ballinrobe will probably get connected quicker because the service is coming out from Claremorris.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Eir and its telephone line, all we can say is that we will bring the issue back to the Department.  We will let ComReg and Eircom know the question has been asked and ask them to update the committee.<\/p> <p>  On the question on who will own the infrastructure, NBI will own the fibre cable on Eircom's infrastructure and on the Enet metropolitan area network.  MANs are owned by the State.  The Eircom infrastructure &ndash; poles and ducts &ndash; are owned by Eir.  If we use the ESB, it owns the poles and ducts, and we are funding NBI to put the cables on that infrastructure.  It will own that cable in 25 years and it will own the business of NBI.  On the protections we have in that regard, the State will recoup 60% of any excess profits NBI earns over the next 25 years.  When there is a valuation of the company in 25 years, the State will get 40% the value back.  Therefore, there are, over 25 years, clawbacks that could see money coming back to the State from the moneys spent initially on the network.

On the dark blue area and Deputy Paul Donnelly's question regarding the pockmarks, let us consider the town of Ballinasloe and the Gaelscoil there.  It is one of the priority areas.  In the town of Ballinasloe, 2 Mbps is being received.  The colour on the map is dark blue.   It is amber in the area to which I wish to refer.  There is one house on the housing estate that is amber.  All of us know it is likely that there are more people on that housing estate who are not getting a minimum of 30 Mbps but, as far as the national broadband map is concerned, only one resident is going to get a fibre connection.  What are we doing to highlight that among the residents in Ballinasloe?  The fibre network is going to be built out in the second quarter of next year and when NBI moves on to the next location, it is going to be very hard to come back to the affected houses.<\/p><p>If those people try to sell those houses, they will not be able to give them away because no one will want to move into a house that does not have a basic level of broadband.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of the 30 Mbps test, when will that threshold up?  A level of 30 Mbps now is like 2 Mbps was ten years ago.  It is outdated with the demands that are being put on.  When will we revise that up?<br\/><br\/>Can the witnesses explain the broken line between Roscommon and Castlerea?  These high-speed connections to the schools are being rolled out, which is welcome, but 19 marts in the country do not have decent broadband.  One of those happens to be in Castlerea, which probably has the worst broadband service of a mart on the country, with huge demands being put on it.  Is there any chance we could service those 19 remaining marts around the country?<br\/><br\/>I have another question on the broadband task force.  I am surprised to hear the task force did not meet this year, particularly when it is the liaison vehicle between the Government, the telecommunications sector and the local authorities and State agencies around the country, especially in the context of Covid-19.  Everyone realised the challenge we have in our broadband and mobile networks on the night of &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot;.  If one happened to be on a Vodafone network, it went down on that occasion.  According to the <i>downdetector.ie<\/i>website, one of our networks went down every second day during the most recent lockdown.  Either our mobile, wireless or fixed broadband networks went down.  Pressure is being put on those networks so what are we doing to try to address that, taking into account what the witnesses have detailed in their earlier evidence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2020121600002#L00500","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":676,"content":"<p>I will start with the dark blue area and I thank the Chairman for that question.

We have a team of people who are monitoring the maps and making sure that those houses that we believe are getting 30 Mbps are getting it.

Like that, one house can trigger a whole area being redesignated and that is what happened in 2019 in our latest change to the map.  Previous to that, we brought 84,000 premises in during 2017.  That is an exercise on which a team of people are working.  We use a conduit of the broadband officers to highlight many issues such as that, consumers email the Department and on a case-by-case basis, we look through what operator we believe should be serving those premises.  It is an important item to raise and to give visibility to and we will continue to work on it.<\/p> <p>  We are seeing that as NBI surveys an area, this triggers all the people in that area to check the map to see if they are in the intervention area.

The only thing that is in a quasi-legal document that allows one to intervene with state aid from the point of view of the Directorate-General for Competition Communications Networks, Content and Technology, which approves state aid, is the threshold at 30 Mbps.  To clarify that so that members do not get the wrong end of the stick on what we can and cannot do - and it is open to Ireland to do this - some member states can intervene and set a bar at 100 Mbps or 500 Mbps in grey areas where there are other commercial companies offering 50 Mbps or 100 Mbps, if the country believes from a policy perspective that it needs to do that.  Ireland has not done that and it is only intervening in white areas.  When the decision is made to only intervene in white areas, which is what we have done because of the commercial activities in all the other areas, there is no market failure in other areas as we see it, other than in the white areas, which are what we have designated and where 544,000 people are based.  Some countries have intervened in grey areas, even in cities, and they have decided to subsidise networks that will offer 1,000 Mbps, for example.  It is open to us to do that but we must get state aid approval.  It is a new state aid approval process but it is open to us to do that.<\/p> <p>  I note that the European Commission is revising the state aid guidelines and consulting on them.

However, it has also been a year of outstanding deeds of humanity and public service.  In our own audiovisual industry, I pay tribute to TG4&rsquo;s in-house staff and to all the independent producers who partner with us.  However, I do not believe that public service broadcasting is delivered solely by the publicly owned broadcasters.  Ireland&rsquo;s commercially owned media, Virgin Media, national radio, and especially local and community radio have indeed provided an excellent public service during this Covid crisis.<\/p> <p>  TG4 believes that a diversity and plurality of voices, views and sources should be available in the indigenous Irish media.  The diagram in my submission suggests how this might be achieved through a mix of the public broadcasters, TG4 and RT&Eacute;; and the public contestable funds, that is, BAI's sound and vision scheme and Screen Ireland&rsquo;s various schemes.  These public contestable funds could ensure the presence of public service media on commercially owned broadcast platforms, including radio.<\/p><p>The Irish audiovisual structure remains much the same as before the Broadcasting Act 2009, largely based in Dublin and with the monolithic presence of a single broadcaster-producer.  The independent production sector in Ireland is currently in a difficult situation and the sector is highly centralised around Dublin.<\/p><p> As we emerge from Covid, TG4 is proposing a reimagined balance in the public funding of the sector.  TG4 believes RT&Eacute; should have the public funding required to meet its obligations but that an equivalent amount of public funding should be shared between TG4, Screen Ireland and the BAI sound and vision scheme.  The effect of this would be to promote diversity and plurality in the sector, promote balance in the public audiovisual ecosystem and improve parity in its regional layout.  TG4 is of the opinion that the issue of balance of scale and reform of the monolithic audiovisual infrastructure is the biggest challenge facing the public media ecosystem in Ireland.  <\/p><p> The biggest challenge facing TG4 in the coming years will be achieving first-class national scale to allow it to play a role of significant prominence in Ireland&rsquo;s media ecosystem and to create meaningful resonance in Irish society.  TG4 partners widely with associations in the fields of tourism, culture, arts, sport and the Irish language.  The organisation can contribute hugely to the public purposes which form the work of this committee.  I look forward to collaborating with the committee over the coming years to achieve some of these objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Esslemont","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Esslemont for his comprehensive presentation.

Virgin Media Television is Ireland&rsquo;s leading independent national public service broadcaster, operating under section 70 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  Our revenues and funding are sourced commercially on a competitive market basis.  We are a major investor in creativity and choice in Ireland, playing an essential part in the plurality of Irish media and keeping the nation informed with trusted news content and current affairs programmes, as well as drama, entertainment and sport.<\/p> <p>  Since the start of the current crisis, we have seen our news viewership increase by more than 50%.  Research by the Department of Health in November found that 44% of the population now go to Virgin Media for their trusted news content.  We operate an efficient broadcasting platform and we live within our budgets.  During the current crisis, our priority has been to ensure continuity and, simultaneously, to radically increase our programming and output.  We have spent an extra and unanticipated &euro;600,000 this year directly related to Covid-19, including increased live broadcasting capacity and technology for remote working.  We are also supporting our communities and businesses with more than &euro;1 million in funding to support our #BackingBusiness and #BackingLocal initiatives, through which we have promoted over 200 Irish small and medium enterprises, SMEs, across our broadcast, digital and social platforms.<\/p> <p>  Public service broadcasting is an essential pillar for Irish society, media plurality and democracy.  It is essential now and for the future that the State&rsquo;s funding of public service broadcasting is both transparent and accountable and that it is channelled and used in a manner that is economically viable, upholds wider plurality throughout the indigenous media sector and ensures a free and fair marketplace.  A move towards contestable funds with clear transparency and accountability, greater collaboration across the entire media ecosystem and a clear strategy on distribution platforms to support all indigenous media would be welcome in policy terms. <\/p> <p>  We welcome and are supportive of the Future of Media Commission, but we believe the timeframe for its work is too protracted to address the challenges of the sector.

My comments touch on a specific point which both of them touched on in their statements.  Mr. Esslemont spoke of not wanting to replace or take away RT&Eacute;'s funding.  He said RT&Eacute; should have the \"public funding required to meet its obligations\" but that an equivalent amount of public funding should be shared between TG4 and other broadcasters.  I note also Mr. Farrell's interesting choice of words when he spoke about \"collaboration across the entire media ecosystem and a clear strategy on distribution platforms\".<\/p> <p>  Taking those comments from Mr. Farrell, in particular, are we looking at duplicating the role of the State broadcaster?  I ask that question because the State broadcaster has specific obligations and there are major costs involved in some of the productions it must carry out.  I would like Mr. Farrell to flesh out what terms such as \"media ecosystem\" mean in pounds, shillings and pence.  What is the request from Virgin Media in that respect?  Where does it see its role with regard to some of the activities that RT&Eacute; currently carries out?  Is Virgin Media looking to duplicate or take away certain aspects of what RT&Eacute; is doing and let Virgin Media do them?<\/p> <p>  From a financial perspective, is there room in the Irish market for two competing television stations, given the limited commercial revenue in play?  Mr. Farrell also pointed out the threat not only to television but also to radio stations and newspapers posed by Google and similar platforms where people can get better bang for their buck.  Is there room for an independent television station and is Virgin Media trying to duplicate certain aspects of what RT&Eacute; is doing?  <\/p> <p>  If TG4 is asking for an equivalent amount of public funding to be provided, is Mr. Esslemont seeking to have the television licence fee doubled to allow that to happen?  How would that funding be raised?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#B00700","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":702,"content":"<p>Regarding the ecosystem of which I spoke, if we look only at broadcasting on television, we will miss the opportunity and the risk in respect of public service broadcasting.  On the specific question of funding, the key point for me, and I think Mr. Esslemont also referred to this, is that there needs to be transparency and accountability concerning what that funding is used for.  That is missing now.  The Future of Media Commission has obviously taken on the task of redefining what public service broadcasting is, but if we look at RT&Eacute;'s annual accounts, as we do, it is hard to figure out where the public money went and where the commercial money went.  That distorts the market.  For this reason, a clear line is needed, first and foremost, regarding what the &euro;200 million from the licence fee is used for, if it is used for the right things and if it distorts the market for all other media.  I say that because we all compete for the same advertisers, and much of that advertising money is moving to the companies mentioned by Senator Cassells, such as Google and Facebook.<\/p> <p>  There needs to be a clear understanding in respect of the money which is for public service broadcasting, what public service broadcasting is and how we can get the best value for that.  I do not think we get any of that information under the present monolithic model, which Mr. Esslemont mentioned, that distorts the market.  Production companies and talent, such as writers and producers and all the people in Screen Ireland who facilitate this ecosystem, are beholden to the decisions made by RT&Eacute; regarding how it uses that money.  That is wrong and it is the fundamental flaw we need to address in the short term.<\/p> <p>  Outside of that aspect, to touch on the point made by the Senator regarding collaboration, we have seen, particularly during this period of Covid-19, the demand for local quality media and trusted content.  The challenge we all have, and this is where I would go on the distribution side, is to make it easier for people to find it.  I say that because people are not now automatically going to the electronic programme guide, EPG, on the television to see what is on at 7 p.m. and 8 p.m.  People expect to find that information on their terms, whether that is on an app, a player, YouTube or elsewhere.  The challenge for us, especially as quality local media, is to find ways to come together and present that good quality content, which is well funded commercially, to the national audience.  The current monolithic model makes it impossible for local and other media to survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Is there room for two players on the field in commercial availability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#B00900","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.

As I mentioned and Mr. Farrell also recognised, the structures in place are monolithic, and monolithic structures bring monolithic behaviours.  Mr. Farrell referred to some of those aspects.  The strongest marker of diversity Ireland has brought to the world is its language and the transmission of that language from generation to generation for thousands of years.  It is clear to me that that intergenerational transmission is in danger and that children brought up in Irish-speaking homes learn very quickly that their language matters less.  Unless we have TG4 and status for the language at the same level as is given to the Welsh language, we will see that intergenerational transmission imperilled.  The biggest danger in the next ten years will be that Ireland will lose its diversity in this area through intergenerational transmission.  There are many aspects to be looked at in respect of funding, but the licence fee definitely needs reform.  We do not receive the licence fee, as we are already State funded.  There are already levies in this market and they are being applied throughout Europe on the top suppliers.  A cocktail of funding could be looked at.

I refer to Mr. Farrell's comment regarding people increasingly deciding where, when and how to view output, not only from television stations but also from the broader broadcast and print media.  How we fund the production of high-quality content needs to reflect that diversity of choice.  In an environment and a world where people are seeking out high-quality, trustworthy content, from news and cultural creative perspectives, I would like to hear how the witnesses would see that undertaking being funded in the future.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Esslemont spoke about transparency in how the licence fee is allocated, for example.  Do we perhaps need to create a central fund from which content producers in the areas of news and creative content can draw sufficient funds, with sufficient standards and scrutiny in place to ensure those moneys are used wisely?  We must move away from the monolithic model the witnesses spoke of because there is a need to reflect the diversity of viewership and listenership.  Regarding the location and regionality of our future output, we must become ever more focused in generating output specific to the regions.  I am interested in hearing the perspectives of Mr. Esslemont and Mr. Farrell on how we could do that.<\/p> <p>  Well done to Mr. Esslemont and TG4 on what it has done for our diaspora around the world.  I have lost count of the number of times I have engaged, both in my previous role as the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and my current role, with people around the world who regularly access TG4 content because of its quality and uniquely Irish nature.  It is something of which they are proud.  I have also spoken with many Irish language speakers around the world who use TG4's material to teach Irish to others, not only Irish people but those in our \"affinity diaspora\", as we are now describing it, who have a fascination with Ireland and its culture, language and people.  How does Mr. Esslemont see that relationship with the diaspora developing in the future?<\/p> <p>  We have also seen the success of the Atlantic economic corridor in driving new tourism activity into communities and regions which may not have had significant tourism activity before.  Alongside that, has TG4 thought of the development of what I will call an Atlantic creative corridor?  This would involve TG4 taking the opportunity to create high-quality cultural output along that same corridor, from Donegal to Waterford, reflecting the unique nature of that landscape and its people and culture, which, as Mr. Esslemont said, has been passed on for centuries through the generations.  Is there something which we can align with that corridor?<\/p> <p>  In that context, increasing numbers of people have started working from home in the last six months.  Interesting groups, such as Grow Remote, are encouraging people to look at remote working options, so we will see a consolidation in the future of thriving and culturally vibrant communities along the west coast.  Could TG4 have some role in bringing all that together and creating the kind of output which people want to consume locally, regionally and internationally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#C01400","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":716,"content":"<p>If it is okay with Deputy Cannon, we will take several members together to ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#C01500","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":717,"content":"<p>That is fine.

On funding and building and the point Mr. Esslemont made in that regard, my feeling is that not much more funding is required, if we are honest.  What is needed is better management of the existing funding and how it is approved and delivered efficiently.  That brings us back to the issue of transparency and accountability.  As Mr. Esslemont said, if we add together the existing funding pillars in respect of Screen Ireland, the BAI's sound and vision scheme and the licence fee, with other money coming from the levy, a healthy model could be created which would allow local newspapers and radio stations to work together with television stations to create content that would resonate not only in Ireland but globally.  Ms N&iacute; Chaoindealbh&aacute;in will address that matter in more detail.<\/p> <p>  On advertising, Virgin Media was about 30% down on normal revenue at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in mid-June.  That meant we were going to lose a great deal of money given the nature of our business, which is fully dependent on the advertising market.  However, it seems there has been a significant recovery in October and November, and December has been better again.  November and December were the first two months in which the decline in revenue stopped and we had some growth year-on-year.  We will still lose money this year but the decline will be approximately 20% compared with what we were seeing in September when it was estimated it would be between 25% and 35%.  That is a positive change.  We are expecting something of a bounce next year because of the estimated savings of around &euro;12 billion in the market and the general momentum that will result from the confidence generated by the vaccine, whenever that is realised.  Next year will be a little distorted, therefore, because we will get some degree of a bounce.<\/p> <p>  The reality for all media is that there is structural decline.  Facebook and Google now account for 50% of the advertising market, and 80% of the digital market.  There is a structural decline in traditional media, therefore, which means that advertising revenue will not grow.  Once we come out of next year's bounce, we will start to see an annual decline of 1% or 2% as that money moves to digital.  That is a challenge.  In that context, we have spoken about a collaboration partnership and a move to digital and shared platforms.  We have seen that in the form of BritBox in the UK, so there is no reason Irish content cannot find a way to come together in a similar way.  As Mr. Esslemont said, we all spend a great deal of money supporting platforms, which is probably not the best use of that money.  If we all came together, perhaps it would be easier for people to find the information they seek on a standard platform and the money saved could go into content and the existing ecosystem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I will pick up on our local commitment.

It will be a question for the legislators as to how that would be done, but there are many choices.  It is possible to come up with a mechanism that is progressive as opposed to the regressive licence fee structure we have now.  It will also be possible to have a model which is individualised or household-based.  The household charge used to assume there was one television in a household.  The emphasis has now shifted to individual preference in media consumption.  That is why the Nordic countries have opted for individualisation of the licence fee structure.<\/p> <p>  The other side of the licence fee issue is that any money which comes into TG4 goes out into the independent sector.

We had a partnership with the <i>Sunday World<\/i>recently for a documentary on John Gilligan, which was a good example of newspapers and television coming together and co-funding a project.  The programme generated an audience of about 300,000, which is pretty good for that type of content.

We have been seeking to get on Freeview channel 8 for a long time and we have been looking for recognition as a public service broadcaster in Northern Ireland.  That is important.  We are already working with broadcasters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  We have a children's programme called \"Sol\", for example, to be broadcast on the winter solstice, which is about how a young person deals with grief.  It is important that we broadcast a programme like that in this year of Covid-19, one which has heart and soul, faces towards a young audience and looks at the subject of grief from the perspective of the return of the light.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Esslemont"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Farrell, Mr. Esslemont and Ms N&iacute; Chaoindealbh&aacute;in for coming in.  My first question probably concerns TG4 and Virgin Media and is on the issue of prominence.  It relates to TG4 as a stand-alone television channel and Virgin Media as an organisation which has a whole television package.  My interest lies in ensuring that the broadcasters to which we give significant public funding are available to viewers across Ireland and that it does not take an age to get to TG4 on the schedules.  Indeed, any television station licensed by the BAI should be available to Irish viewers on televisions, whether those are Apple, Samsung or other devices.  I would like Mr. Farrell and Mr. Esslemont to address that issue of prominence and what needs to be done in that regard.  Do we need legislation?<\/p> <p>  My other question concerns linear programming.  I asked the representatives from RT&Eacute; for how long we might be scheduling linear television broadcasting.  Mr. Farrell mentioned the staples of Virgin Media, such as Ireland AM.  How will those programmes sit with players in the absence of a future schedule?<\/p> <p>  My last question is on the dual funding model which RT&Eacute; enjoys.  Is it more valuable for the commercial broadcaster to have access to the sound and vision scheme for public service broadcasting, rather than removing the dual funding model, given what Mr. Farrell has said about the growth of advertising revenue for Google and Facebook?  Removing the dual funding model which RT&Eacute; enjoys might not be of any great benefit to TG4 or Virgin Media if the advertising goes to Google or Facebook instead.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#E00900","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Farrell like to answer those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#E01000","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I might work backwards and let Ms N&iacute; Chaoindealbh&aacute;in talk about how long the linear schedules will exist and the EPG slot.  The topic of dual funding comes back to the same argument for me, in that it will be difficult to understand how we will perform if we are not clear what our focus is and how we are being measured.  On the issue of chasing advertising revenue, the big argument in that context is whether a programme such as \"EastEnders\", for example, is public service broadcasting or a commercially-driven initiative.  That is a murky subject.  Should such a programme be in one place or should it be separated?<\/p> <p>  Telling a business it has &euro;200 million and what it has to do with that money within its remit allows it to do that more easily, effectively and within budget, as a service which can be measured, improved and developed, than to say there is &euro;200 million here and another &euro;200 million there and the business should go off and do whatever it wants.  There is enough money to do it but it is not being done efficiently or clearly, and it is not being measured transparently.  At a dual funding level, and this is not the fault of RT&Eacute;, it is hard to run between the two measures when, as outlined previously, the advertising market is inherently cyclical and follows the economy more so than most business trackers.  That is something to which we will always be beholden.  I think better decisions would be made if the question posed was how it would be possible to get value for money from &euro;200 million in respect of public service broadcasting.  The rest of the ecosystem will benefit because it would then be possible to state that the rest of the funding will go into what we define as the other requirements of public service content.<\/p><p>Our written submission states that we should be referring to &quot;public service content&quot; and not &quot;broadcasting&quot; because it is being generated and created in many different ways.  <br\/><br\/>On the scalability element, discovery is the big priority.  Ms N&iacute; Chaoindealbh&aacute;in will discuss where electronic programme guides are going and scheduling in general, but discovery and the ability to find content should be the priority for all of us now.  EPGs and linear programming work and will continue to work.  The situation is similar to that of newspapers.  Some 12 years ago, I remember many people in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>were saying that newspapers would be gone within five years.  They are still there, ticking along, with circulation figures lower some days than others, but still surviving.  EPGs will continue to exist as well.  Outside of that, however, in the world of Netflix and Apple TV, there must be some prioritisation in discovery and how it will be possible for people to find and access content.  The audiovisual media services directive is going to look at this issue, I think, or needs to look at it, as does the Future of Media Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#E01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":739,"content":"<p>On the EPG, we will definitely continue to schedule for linear programming.  There is a myth that television viewership is dropping, but we have seen the importance of live and local Irish content during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our ratings have been up this year.  The commercial market does not reflect this, particularly when we had the tough time in quarters 2 and 3.  The EPG is therefore important across all platforms and for all broadcasters in Ireland, including Virgin Media Television, VMTV, and Virgin Media Ireland, VMIE, more generally.  It is important for all broadcasters in Ireland to have the EPG listing and that it is recognised and easy to access.<\/p> <p>  We must look at the demographic of our audience and the shift that has happened due to Covid-19.  There has been a shift and an increase in the number of people looking for box sets and looking at other providers, such as Amazon and Netflix.  We must adapt to that and we will do so.  It will involve what we commission and how we commission, so that we keep our audience with us.

For this reason, the future will be blended.<\/p> <p>  To echo what Mr. Farrell said, it is important that Irish content be prominent for Irish viewers.

We provide the same service for Irish as BBC Alba does for Scots Gaelic and S4C does for the Welsh language.  We feel we should be recognised as a public service broadcaster in the UK.

That is a big issue which is holding us back with audiences in the North.<\/p> <p>  There are, however, many good things in the North.  We work with the Irish Language Broadcast Fund, and the children's programme I mentioned is being done with funding from it.  There is also a contestable fund for young people's programming in the UK.  We are therefore recognised at a certain level in the UK, but the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in the North needs to put TG4 on the list of public service broadcasters.

Every year the conversation tends to be about the licence fee, how much is being paid or avoided, but recent responses to parliamentary questions in the House show that the avoidance fee has come down by 3% each year, while the collection fee this year is on target to be the same as it was last year.  Much of the noise is focused in the wrong area, namely, how much of the licence fee is not coming in, rather than how revenue from the fee is being spent.  That narrative needs to change quickly.<\/p> <p>  We come back then to the point Mr. Esslemont and I have made throughout regarding how this funding is defined and allocated.  Screen Ireland and the BAI's sound and vision scheme do a good job in making good decisions.  Those decisions are supported by the independent producers, the local companies on the ground which are coming up with the ideas, and we are very much partners in that process.  The problem with the current model is that we have between 1,800 and 1,900 people who are supported to make all those decisions, and that means those people on the ground in Tipperary, Galway or Mayo do not have as big a say in or influence on what content is being created.  A radical overhaul is needed of how those decisions are made and in respect of that community and ecosystem.<\/p> <p>  Touching on some previous questions, and with reference to technology, which Ms N&iacute; Chaoindealbh&aacute;in will comment on in greater detail, we have seen in our Cork and Limerick bureaux that technology, and other aspects, facilitate a more dynamic relationship with the guys on the ground in respect of the production of content straight into a broadcaster, and not the clunky model supported by the existing licence model.

She does not go to a Gaelscoil, but being aware of the language and hearing it spoken are important.  I can only imagine the importance of TG4 for those children who have that wonderful opportunity to go to a Gaelscoil.

My daughter teaches in Dublin and she has told me there are about 30 nationalities in her primary school.  It is a new Ireland speaking Irish and that is wonderful.<\/p> <p>  The biggest problem in front of us, however, is for those who speak Irish naturally to value the language enough for them to feel their language is worth as much as the English language in Ireland.  That is a huge step and there is a great deal of work which we must do.  We are doing well with those learning the language, and we have done well with the image this year.  We managed to bring forward our strategy on education and we are now broadcasting \"C&uacute;la4 ar Scoil\", which has been a great success.  There are more than 200,000 people who speak Irish at home.  To grow rather than lose that pot will require us to create high-quality content for young people and that includes drama and light entertainment in Irish.

We appreciate this opportunity to meet and brief the committee about the challenges facing the news publishing industry since the onset of Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  As chair of NewsBrands Ireland and having served over 30 years in the news publishing industry here and in Australia, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing Irish news publishers.  Paradoxically, the reach of our publishers&rsquo; journalism has never been so great, but publishers are struggling to stay afloat owing to the pandemic and a perfect storm of other issues.<\/p> <p>  The economic model which once sustained newspapers is broken.  Newspaper sales have declined by almost 50% in the past ten years.  Revenues from print advertising for national titles have dropped by over 75% from a high of &euro;367 million in 2007 to &euro;87 million in 2019.  The forecast for 2020 is around &euro;60 million, a further decline of over 30% compared with last year.  The decline in print advertising has not been replaced by digital advertising, which is being hoovered up by giant digital corporations such as Google and Facebook, which secured &euro;425 million of advertising revenues from this market in 2019, compared with &euro;26 million in digital revenues for national news publishers.  The dominance of the tech platforms is being addressed by governments, together with their competition authorities, in other countries, including the UK, Australia and France.  Unlike the UK and elsewhere, newspaper sales and digital subscriptions are taxed here, and publishers face draconian libel laws which are out of kilter with almost every other jurisdiction.  Ireland is an outlier compared with other countries, where governments actively support their news publishing sectors in the form of direct and indirect subsidies.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate the recent short-term supports through the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and Covid-19 related advertising.  It is vital that the advertising support continues in the short to medium term.  However, if this committee believes that public interest journalism is something worth fighting for, it can support the industry in the longer term in the following ways.  We need to reduce VAT to 5% on newspapers and digital news products and ultimately reduce VAT to 0% as is the case in Britain and other EU countries; tackle the dominance of tech platforms in the digital advertising market; complete the long-overdue review of the Defamation Act 2009; and reform Ireland&rsquo;s draconian defamation laws that support legal costs so punitive they genuinely have the potential to put publishers out of business.<\/p> <p>  In the shorter term, subsidies should be considered for the distribution and posting of newspapers.  These are not big asks and supports such as these are modelled on those in many other European countries.  The news publishing industry needs support now to ensure it can continue to perform its critical role in providing fact-checked, reliable information to citizens, particularly at a time when such information is critically important.

Mr. Kavanagh, Mr. O'Reilly and I are happy to answer members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the invitation to address the committee.  I am representing Local Ireland and I am accompanied online by Mr. Johnny O'Hanlon, executive director with Local Ireland.  We represent 46 weekly paid-for local newspapers of record with a membership spread across Ireland.  Our titles are read by 1.5 million readers weekly across the various platforms and we generate 90% of the published local news coverage in the country.  We employ over 1,000 reporters, correspondents and columnists and are, in effect, the largest local news agency outside of Dublin and Cork cities.<\/p> <p>  Each week, our titles publish vital, trusted public interest information ranging from what is happening in these Houses to information on local authorities, local courts, local education and training boards and policing authorities, not to mention sports, community events and life in regional Ireland as it happens.  Our readers have trusted us through the decades but there is a serious threat to the financial future of our titles, caused most immediately by the pandemic but in reality, our industry has been so badly impacted by the last recession and the dominance of Facebook and Google as we work to build a sustainable digital model to counter the migration from print media.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the pandemic, an audit of member titles for the period from April to November 2020 reveals that our circulation, advertising and event income revenues have seen a staggering decline of &euro;6.38 million or almost 22%.

At the time, &quot;Today with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke&quot; sent Paddy O'Gorman to ask parishioners in Finglas west their thoughts about this.  One man who was asked what he thought said he thought it was ridiculous.  When Paddy O'Gorman asked him if he ever went to mass he said he did not.  Another man who was asked what he thought said he was disgusted because it was a very famous landmark and that he told people how to get places using it.  When he was asked whether he ever went to mass he said he did not.  The witnesses will get the gist of my fear, which is that ten years from now we will be speaking about the death of local or national newspapers as a relevant news source and when people are asked whether they ever bought them they will say they did not.  This is the starting point.  I hear what the witnesses are saying about the tax treatment of digital platforms but it is a starting point.  I am passionate about this particular topic.  Mr. Mulrennan gave me my first job in local media 20 years ago when he was chief executive of the Drogheda Independent Group.  Back then we had bustling newsrooms and production on site.  Those days are long gone.<\/p><p>Mr. Mulrennan set out the case for State funding for local newspapers similar to what has happened in local radio.  In my area we have the <i>Meath Chronicle and Cavan and Westmeath Herald<\/i>, of which he is chief executive, and the local radio station LMFM.  Mr. Mulrennan seeks funding of &euro;2.6 million, equal to what was introduced last July for commercial radio, including local radio.  Is there a basis for such Exchequer funding for local newspapers in other countries and, if so, at what level?<\/p><p>Mr. Crowley commented on tackling the dominance of advertising online.  I say to him, and to the remote witnesses representing The Irish Times and the Business Post, that this is obviously where the game is with regard to having a free market and people going where they want to advertise their products.  Notwithstanding my passion for print media, I do not think we will achieve the survival of one particular industry by overtly penalising another which is relevant in the here and now.  I am interested in teasing out further the point on support for the industry and whether this would be through a reduction in VAT, on which the industry has lobbied us previously in the audiovisual room.  It would be a retrograde step to move into a scenario of penalising one area just to try to support another that is having huge problems not only with regard to advertising revenue but also with decreasing sales.  I ask the representatives of The Irish Times and the Business Post about their online subscriptions.  It was reported they increased during Covid.  I also ask Mr. Mulrennan whether this can be tackled through local media.<\/p><p>Mr. John Whittingdale, whom I have met, is the minister of state with responsibility for media and data in the UK.  He is also passionate about print media.  Only two weeks ago, he said that he would take a lot of convincing before he would provide further financial support for the industry either directly or through tax relief and that a plateau of support had been reached.  He introduced the local democracy reporter scheme, whereby a portion of the BBC licence fee is used to pool moneys to provide reporters on the ground at council meetings and in courtrooms.  I know local newspapers are struggling to provide this content.  In some areas, we are not getting the newspapers we used to get in the past.  This is something I will push for and I am interested to know whether the witnesses would support such a scheme in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#J00200","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":757,"content":"<p>To follow on from Senator Cassells, this is about sketching out the media landscape in Ireland and where the witnesses see it going.  If State funding is not made available over the next decade, how many national print titles and local print titles will continue to exist?  As most of the print titles shift online, they operate behind a paywall and different media outlets have operated in different ways.  What is the extent to which the witnesses believe this business model will be sustainable and people will be able to continue to pay for their news behind a paywall?<\/p> <p>  The second challenge of which I am always conscious in this era is that we have been very lucky with the media here.  Trusted news sources have been particularly good during this difficult period.  While trusted news sources move behind a paywall, we can get all sorts of nonsense for free.  How will we continue to convince people that paying for news makes sense?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#J00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":758,"content":"<p>A number of questions have been asked.  With regard to Senator Cassells's point on people not going to mass, people still need to consume news and still desire to consume it so perhaps the cases are a little bit different.  If people do not go to mass, perhaps they substitute it in other respects but there is a continuing requirement for news.  There is an important need to continue to provide it.  Our challenge is that it is costly to provide this trusted news.<\/p> <p>  Senator Byrne's point is valid.  There is an increasing number of paywalls because they are an effort to recoup some of the costs of journalists checking and fact checking and paying libel suits.  There is a real cost that we have to try to recoup.  We are recouping it less and less from physical newspaper sales.  It is not like mass in that sense, in that people are still looking to get news content but they are getting it in other ways, as Senator Byrne alluded to, through paywalls or Google and Facebook, which use our news and do not pay for it and then get significant advertising revenues on the back of it.  There is an imbalance there.  It is not about neutering Google and Facebook.  Let them off to do what they do but to use the old clich&eacute; of levelling the playing field, they monetise significantly the benefit they get from free access to our content, with &euro;425 million revenue in 2019 on the back of this content.  I am not saying it is just our content as there are other things.  It is about levelling the playing field.  It is not a case of stopping or hindering them from doing what they are doing but having them pay their fair share for accessing content we have generated and paid for through our journalists.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Kavanagh or Mr. O'Reilly would like to add their views on how they see this in their newsrooms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":759,"content":"<p>The Irish Times is the proud owner of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the<i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and four regional titles and we also have a share in two radio stations.  We have a broad media mix.  On the point made on the dependence on advertising revenue and the future model for news publishers, we are particularly tuned into the paid for content model of home delivery and annual paid for subscriptions.  <i>The Irish Times <\/i>has been on this journey for the past four or five years.  During the pandemic we have been particularly successful in attracting new subscribers.  Our total subscriber base this year increased by 40% and much of this was during the pandemic.  We have an interesting contrast with the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>which does not have a paywall model.  We are investing to try to bring one to the market early in the new year.  It is significantly more of a challenge than for <i>The Irish Times <\/i>because of the lack of this.  On the point Mr. Crowley made, we need time and space to be able to make this investment and enable a title such as the<i>Irish Examiner <\/i>to catch up over a period of time.<br\/><br\/>I want to make a point about mass-goers.<\/p><p>News publishers generally - it is definitely the case for all of our titles - have seen a massive increase in their audience over the course of the pandemic.  The relevance of our titles as news publishers in the market at the moment has probably never been higher.  They have played a very significant and strong role during the pandemic in producing news and information across the board.  I do not subscribe to the mass-goer proposition.  I do think we have a very strong and loyal audience.

I fully agree with the points both Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Crowley have made.  I will give the perspective of a small publisher.  We are the last Irish-owned, Irish-controlled newspaper on a Sunday in this country, which is quite something.<br\/><br\/>I will take the financial side of this question.  I agree with Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Crowley that the analogy of the mass-goer is probably the wrong way to look at this.  The reality is that people are consuming more news now than they ever have, but they are consuming it in a completely different way, which is through smartphones and free applications.  That has impacted on circulation revenues and advertising revenues, which are the traditional revenue models that newspapers have survived on.  <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>has a very hard paywall, at a premium price.  The move to paywalls is a necessity, driven by the fact that our traditional model has changed and will probably never return.  I agree with Mr. Kavanagh that there is an audience.  We saw exactly the same thing during Covid, which was a return to fact-checked, high-quality, trusted public service journalism.  It is hugely important that we maintain that, but at the end of the day we are private companies and we have to be able to survive by earning money.  The model for how we are able to do that is determined by how we are able to make revenue and digital subscriptions are important to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Reilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":762,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. O'Hanlon to comment in a moment on how the overseas model works.

I refer, for example, to LMFM, which broadcasts in the area from which Deputy Munster and Senator Cassells operate, MidWest Radio, which broadcasts in Deputy Dillon's area, and South East Radio.  Local radio has served this country very well.  We saw Mr. John Purcell here before the committee a month ago.  We are at the cutting edge of the private sector in local newspapers.  We have not benefited from any of the State funding which came through the sound and vision fund for local radio.  Budgets are tight.  As to where budgets come from, I suggest that now there is a Minister for the media and a Department has been set up, local newspapers be provided with access to funding from the licence fee, the revenue that is coming into the Department.  Without it, we are simply not going to be there for the long term.<br\/><br\/>We have a very defined business model to cater for the move from print to digital.  For the month of September, local newspapers had more than 8 million unique visitors and 26 million page impressions.  Our challenge is not traffic, which is tremendous, it is monetisation and the fact that Google and Facebook are effectively piggybacking on our content.  Our challenge, due to the commercial reality of a 22% fall in income in the months from April to September, is to resource our newsrooms &ndash; the committee discussed that issue with Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley a month ago &ndash; and also to fund a sustainable, digital strategy.  We are grateful for what the State gave the taxpayer via the employment schemes.  We no longer qualify for them, as to do so a company's revenue needs to be down by more than 30%.  The real challenge is that we are facing such a quandary, in particular in the coming months.  It will be quarter 1, into April, before the vaccine takes effect.  We are looking for immediate funding.  We welcome the Future of Media Commission, but that is more for the medium to long term.<br\/><br\/>Senator Byrne asked about local newspapers that are at risk of going out of business.  Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley instanced the loss of the Roscommon titles.  He mentioned the <i>Roscommon Champion<\/i>newspaper.  In terms of newspapers in his own area in County Wexford, four good titles have been lost.  Those of us who are still in publishing are good at our job, but we do want a level playing field.

Mr. O'Hanlon will be familiar with<i>The Connaught Telegraph<\/i>and the work of Mr. Tom Kelly, <i>The Western People<\/i>, and Mr. James Laffey and Mr. Michael John Duffy in the <i>Mayo News<\/i>.  These newspapers connect communities and give them a sense of belonging, as well as pride of place, especially when they are weekly publications.  I should also mention the <i>Mayo Advertiser <\/i>and Mr. Declan Varley.  He is doing a great job.

I could not agree more.  At a time when people urgently need access to factual and trustworthy information, the output of the witnesses and their colleagues is critically important to the production of such information and its consumption by readers.  This is probably the most challenging time for those for whom the production of that factual, trustworthy information matters.<\/p><p>The establishment of the Future of Media Commission is a significant milestone in determining how exactly we are to address the challenges the witnesses face.  The recent appointment of Ms Siobh&aacute;n Holliman is critical in bringing real-world experience, particularly of working in local print media.  That the challenges faced on the front line can be reflected in the work commission represents a really important move.<br\/><br\/>I have two observations.  In a former role, I visited a country a long way from here that I will not name because I do not want to embarrass anyone.  Each morning, I received under the door of my hotel bedroom a copy of the equivalent of one of our national newspapers here.  On day two, I began to notice the distinct lack of criticism of any government, politician or policy emanating from the government.  I happened to ask our ambassador based in the country why the newspaper was just full of glorious and effusive praise of politicians.  It was quite alien to me, as those present will have to admit.  The ambassador said that if I had a newspaper that was almost wholly funded by the government and I needed to apply for a licence at the beginning of each year to continue printing, I would be producing output of exactly the same nature.  I fully support the concept of this country establishing some sort of dedicated funding mechanism for all our media, both print media and the media of the gentleman who attended earlier.  How do the representatives feel we can preserve that most crucial of things, journalistic integrity, and the production of factual, trustworthy information in a world where media are increasingly reliant on state funding to survive?  How does one draw the line?  Where is it drawn in the sand?  How do we ensure that we can continue to have robustness and integrity in our journalistic output?<br\/><br\/>I have been looking at examples of newspapers that have gone digital in recent months.  Consider what <i>The Washington Post<\/i>has done, albeit with the support of Mr. Jeff Bezos, which is helpful.  <i>The Guardian<\/i>is another wonderful example.  We are seeing some incredibly good examples, including now in Ireland, of newspapers moving behind a paywall and successfully bringing their loyal print readership with them.  Do the witnesses envisage an opportunity to avail of specific State funding to assist print media in making this transition successfully?  Whatever about my generation, my son's generation is consuming everything it knows about this country and the world on a digital device.  My son, who is 24, has never bought a newspaper and never will.  How do we assist those people we rely on for information to migrate to digital and to do so successfully?  Is there a mechanism elsewhere in the world that we could replicate here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#K01100","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":772,"content":"<p>Who would like to respond to those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#L00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I will give a national newspaper perspective and maybe Mr. Mulrennan will contribute afterwards.<br\/><br\/>On the question on VAT, a reduction in VAT from 9% to 0% reduces the cover price for the consumer, be it a consumer of a digital subscription or a consumer of a physical print paper.  The reduction makes it cheaper to buy the paper, which, in theory, increases sales or the number of subscriptions.  Alternatively, if we did not pass on the full amount of the VAT reduction, the proceeds would accrue to the benefit of the newspaper publisher and enable it to invest in its newsroom or whatever.  The extra money could either be passed on to the consumer to increase take-up or reinvested in the newspaper to do some of the things Deputy Cannon alluded to in terms of making us fit for purpose to service his 24-year-old son.We would be producing content that he would be willing to pay for.  Since we have given content away for free for so many years, there has been great reluctance to educate people and tell them they cannot have the content for free because it costs money to generate it, check it, etc.  There is a journey.  In fairness to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and the <i>Business Post<\/i>, they are well down that road.  The Independent News &amp;amp; Media group has recently gone down that road, but it is a road that we have to go down.  It is a matter of making people willing to pay for something that they have got for free for the past ten or 15 years.<br\/><br\/>On the question of State funding and the impact on editorial teeth and editorial investigations, for example, one can see various examples around the world.  While we are looking for support, we are not looking for support in the sense of the Government funding our journalists; we are looking for support that would mean that the current review of the Defamation Act, which has been ongoing for some time, would come through.  We put forward some fairly clear-cut suggestions as to how the costs of defamation could be reduced for newspaper publishers.  I am not referring to taking away people's right to preserve their good name but to the levels of awards and legal costs attaching to them.  The costs here are a multiple of what they are in the United Kingdom and continental Europe.  Addressing that alone would be of significant benefit.  It is not really going to affect an editor's willingness to criticise the Deputy or anybody else.  It is a levelling of the playing field without supporting journalists directly.  There are measures of this kind that preserve independence which we accept are extremely important.  None of us might like being called to account but it is important that we all be called to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Vincent Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":774,"content":"<p>To address Deputy Cannon's point on the migration, I so happened to be looking at <i>The Connaught Telegraph<\/i>the day before yesterday.  It had 870,000 unique visitors for the month of October and 1.3 million page impressions.  It is not a particularly big newspaper.  It has four or five journalists but they are avidly focused on 24-7 journalism.  Before the newspaper appears in the shops on a Tuesday morning, Mr. Tom Kelly and the staff are ready with copy.  This is particularly the case with a very important event coming up this Saturday evening.  We are now local news publishers; we are not local newspapers any more.  We have to be.  The Deputy mentioned <i>The Washington Post<\/i>, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and the <i>Business Post<\/i>.  What local newspapers lack is scale.  We are not going to have the scale to develop a remunerative paywall model, and that is where the State funding comes in.  We are commercial organisations.  We are very good at managing our costs.  In fact, Celtic Media Group, but also other local newspapers, would not have come through 2020 without the support of its staff, so many whom have made salary sacrifices, but we do not have the scale to survive in an era of paywalls.  That is where State funding comes in.<br\/><br\/>On the dangers of being funded by the Government and not holding it to task, I do not see this as a significant risk because I do not regard the funding as significant compared with overall turnover.

I do not regard that as a major concern at all.  We certainly hope that funding of the kind in question will come out of the recommendations from the Future of Media Commission and that it will come under the remit of the new Minister responsible for media.<\/p><p>If I could go back to an earlier point about our relevance as news providers in the country, our newspapers are not only newspapers, as Mr. Mulrennan has said, in the printed format, but household brands in every county.  We are now multi-news providers.  We are providing news in print, online and on mobile.  We host many events of great significance locally, running from business to culture to sport.  We are also community leaders.  When communities are struggling or have issues, it is their local newspaper and local radio station that flags them.  Key to all of this is the level of investment our members are making in reporters.  We employ more than 1,000 reporters, correspondents and columnists who produce trusted news weekly.  The most recent piece of Research and Analysis of Media, RAM, research was done this summer and it indicated that our trust level is at 71%.  In terms of social media and the fake news cycle, it knocks everything for six.<\/p><p> We have trusted brands.  Unless something is done soon, those trusted brands will start to fall off the perch and some day someone is going to wake up and ask how we let that happen.  We have had a tsunami since 2008, with the economic crisis when we saw our advertising revenues fall by 60%.  We have also had the advent of the mobile phone, Google, Facebook and, lately, the pandemic.  Those are our key issues.

Most national news organisations now are what we would call digital first.  The first instinct is to put the story up online immediately.  Newspapers try to be first because if they are not first out of the blocks, somebody else will be out of the blocks and the story will be gone.  There are certain exclusive stories that they may keep, for example, investigative-type stories.  Maybe I should not mention this but the golfgate story, for example, went up online the evening before it was published in print.  Obviously, it was a front-page story the following day.  It is a digital first mentality and that is how the journalists now think.  Journalists write across both the digital and print media and their mindset has changed.  That has been a journey for them as well because the instinct of a journalist is to hold the story for the newspaper the following day but one cannot really do that any more.  In a sense, one of the things we are looking for in the midst of all of this is a bit of breathing space to pivot from being a newspaper producer to a digital producer.  All our member titles are on that journey but there is a bit of time involved in getting there.

However, the single biggest problem we have is that we are fighting global giants which have unlimited resources.  That is the area where we are struggling.  We are constantly trying to be first to the marketplace with things.  We live in a small economy with a small number of people, yet we are up against unlimited resources.

It is owned by Malcolm Denmark, who took over many things, and the way he treated the staff was disgraceful, horrible and obnoxious.

Many Deputies and Senators will take it as an opportunity to mention their local newspaper and there is nothing wrong with that, because we are all aware of the incredible service provided by local newspapers.  National newspapers deserve a mention here too.  I see the challenges facing local print media at the coalface in my area.  I am from Clonakilty in Cork South-West.  It has <i>The Southern Star<\/i>.  Sean Mahon sits on the board of Local Ireland and he has briefed me on this regularly.  We also have the <i>West Cork People<\/i>, the <i>Bandon Opinion<\/i>and <i>The Carrigdhoun<\/i>.  It is quite a healthy offering of local print media but we can see at first hand the challenges these titles face.<\/p><p>I want to speak about the contributions that newspapers have made, particularly during Covid, the information people had at first hand and the adaptability that they showed, whether switching to digital formats or going back to old-school newspaper delivery.  I thought it was fantastic, when people were confined to within 2 km of their homes.  I apologise if I am repeating what other members have said, as I was not here when they said it.  I know people availed of a delivery service in their droves.  They welcomed seeing their local newspaper.  We must keep in mind that some people read it from front to back and really rely on it.  The local newspaper was an important information service.<\/p><p>There has been mention of accountability.  We probably all pay for political advertising in our local newspapers and we use it as an opportunity to express our views on certain matters or to deliver good news.  However, there is also accountability.  It is not like one is getting a free ride.  We are held to account if there are mishaps.  If there are issues on which people do not necessarily agree with us, we will be held to account.  If that is lost, local accountability is lost.  As Mr. O'Hanlon said, local print media is the most truthful, honest source.  If ever there was a situation in which someone could not be accused of producing &quot;fake news&quot;, it would be with local print media.  It is honest, old-fashioned reporting.  These newspapers provide support for local events, particularly awards ceremonies.  Many local newspapers are connected to sports, business and tourism awards.  We all take these for granted, but they have significant value.<\/p><p>I support the calls for extra grant aid.  Mr. Mahon has briefed me on the benefits that a reduction in VAT would have, which I also support.  I believe Mr. O'Hanlon mentioned how journalists must now write across both print and online media.<\/p><p> Are politicians and public representatives at fault in some way?  I have been in politics for 13 years.  Previously a politician who got a good news story would send a press release to the local media and now they are straight on to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.  Are we playing a part in the demise of local media?  I believe national print media has made not a seamless but quite a good transition to the digital world such as Twitter and having articles online.  Even though the local newspapers are trying, they do not appear to be as successful at it.  Do we have a part to play?  Are we too quick to go to social media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2020121600002#N00500","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":791,"content":"<p>I appreciate being here.

I also did some small features for newspapers like the <i>Roscommon Herald<\/i>and the <i>Roscommon People<\/i>, formerly the <i>Roscommon Champion<\/i>in Roscommon.  County Roscommon is also served by the <i>Westmeath Independent<\/i>, the <i>Longford Leader<\/i>, the <i>Athlone Topic<\/i>, the <i>Leitrim Observer<\/i>, <i>The Connacht Tribune<\/i>, and the <i>Tuam Herald<\/i>.

Those local newspapers are very important, particularly to the older generation.  I have a brother who is a postman.  It is a great policy of An Post that, wherever they can, postmen and postwomen are delivering a newspaper to a person living alone.  The newspapers still have an important role.

It is more to do with the UK but it is what we are looking for as well.  We are looking for a level playing field in order that we can still compete in Europe.  We are an island off an island and we cannot change the time that ferries take but it leads to logistical nightmares and other issues with which we need some assistance to keep on that playing field.<\/p><p> The Irish road hauliers have responded over the years to the requirements of industry and customers, whatever they may be.  They have given a very good and thorough service to the customers and by doing so, we may have somewhat inadvertently created an excellent, streamlined and efficient business to take the goods of Ireland to market and the requirements of Ireland home.  We must do our best and perhaps go the extra steps in order to keep that streamlined service in place.  That is why we are here today.<\/p><p> At the outset, I commend the committee on having us here today and it is vital that it retains its vigilance and interest in what happens to our freight and transport industry in the coming months.  The committee has a particular role in holding the State and its agencies to account to ensure that they do their jobs properly and place the needs and well-being of our citizens to the fore of their consideration and focus.  It is very important that the committee understands that the next four weeks will be a period of unprecedented disruption for the movement of goods in Ireland.  The period might stretch longer than four weeks because of stockpiling, and there may be a quiet period in January.  I can reassure the committee that the disruption is on the way nonetheless.<\/p><p> For the first time in nearly 50 years, we will be back with customs and import controls coming and going to the island.  Even if a deal is reached and implemented between the EU and the UK on tariffs, the new arrangements involving inspections by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will create hold-ups at our ports and airports.  For hauliers, these disruptions and obstructions will have catastrophic consequences if the process is not streamlined as much as possible.<\/p><p> For a start we do not influence the scheduling of ferries, the opening of terminals or the management of traffic at our ports and approaching roads.  We are entirely dependent on the people who run the ferries, control the ports and manage the traffic to ensure that they operate effectively and efficiently.  Even without the new checks and controls, our ports are heavily congested at certain peak times.  God only knows what the level of disruption will be in the weeks ahead.  For our members, these new checks and controls will have huge implications and massive consequences.<\/p><p> As hauliers we are under considerable pressure to get our goods to their destination on time and in good condition for our customers.  Our drivers also operate under strict tachograph rules, which tightly regulate their driving hours.  If a driver goes over his or her hours, for example, while waiting for a customs or departmental check, he or she is hit by a mandatory rest period and can go no further.  The driver would have to park up in the parking spaces of these authorities and cannot move if he or she is over that time.  The disruption that this will cause is immense and has the capacity to slow the licensed haulage industry and introduce a logistical nightmare.<\/p><p> What can be done to ensure that we reduce the risks of delay, congestion and disruption to trade?  First, it is vital that there is a single entity that takes responsibility for the free movement of traffic at our ports so that this does not fall between the cracks.  For example, in Dublin Port, where any delays and congestion could be acute when the new system of checks and controls is introduced, the movement of traffic into and around the port falls to no fewer than six separate entities.  These are Dublin Port Company, Dublin City Council, the National Roads Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport.  Some single entity needs to take overall control and responsibility for traffic into out of and around the port as otherwise, the ball will be passed from Billy to Jack and we will end up with unco-ordinated chaos.<\/p><p> Let us tackle the obvious pressure points which we can do something about.  For example, it is completely insane that the main roll-on, roll-off ferry services in Dublin Port all arrive and depart roughly within 30 minutes, 45 minutes or an hour of each other.  The main four services in the morning come in between 5.30 a.m. and 6.30 a.m., and they reload and get ready to go back out to sea within 45 minutes to an hour between 8 a.m. and 9.15 a.m.  This schedule ensures that there is massive pressure on facilities and the road network at specific times rather than being spread throughout the day.  It makes sense that in the context of the challenges that Brexit will present, the schedules for these ferries should be spread out and not so concentrated.  It is plain that we are creating this congestion ourselves and something will have to change.<\/p><p> This is happening when the ro-ro depots are opening in the morning.  If the ferry companies do not make these changes themselves, then the port authorities should force them to do so and use whatever statutory powers they have to control ships within the ports under the Harbours Acts.  There is also an added concern that we need to be assured that the ferry companies are not acting in unison, talking to each other or doing anything uncompetitive.  I am not saying they are but the regulatory authorities should keep an eye on this and ensure it does not happen.<\/p><p> We also need the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Department of Transport to observe that this is going on and that this is not business as usual.  They must recognise that licensed hauliers will face unprecedented challenges due to obstructions and delays and as such, they require an element of flexibility in the application of existing rules.  We are not talking about compromising road safety or driver welfare, but instead about taking account of the acute pressure and stress on the sector with a more purposeful enforcement regime.  They should actively pursue the scope for any derogations that can be applied for the next extraordinary period.  Some of the very tight rules around the tachograph can be adjusted, as was done at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is not a very big adjustment but at least it allows flexibility and an easing of how we do business and allows us to get on with it a bit better.<\/p><p> Finally, it is imperative that the State agencies, including the Revenue Commissioners, the HSE, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Transport, which are going to be conducting the inspections and controls at our ports, deploy adequate resources and technology to allow them to do so with the least disruption possible.  The inspection points need to be manned to meet demand, and IT should be used to the maximum to ensure that drivers can prepare for and minimise delays.  A risk-based approach should be adopted to inspections.<\/p><p> The success or failure of Ireland&rsquo;s preparation for Brexit will not be on the shoulders of us but rather it will firmly rest with the State and the different State agencies that have been asked by the Government to carry out the preparations.  We are asking that this committee should be fearless and relentless in holding these entities to account to do their job as efficiently as possible.  They may need to take some steps outside their own remit, by which I mean that the liaison between customs staff here and their counterparts in different countries must be to facilitate the bringing about of practical steps to facilitate the streamlined movement of freight.<\/p><p> For example, some of the direct ferries are now in operation for the Continent and the main hub of Europe.  They will be the ship of choice for most people but there will be times, perhaps as a result of sea conditions or customs requirements, when we will have to go through the land bridge of England.  We also have a great fisheries industry, including shellfish, and with what is called a groupage load, a number of small fisheries people may send to destinations across northern France and perhaps down to Spain.  That groupage requires a set of papers to be declared.  We accept that we have to declare this in Dublin or Holyhead but what is declared in Dublin should be accepted immediately by France.<\/p><p>Ireland is an EU country and we are only using Britain as a land bridge.  Trucks are sealed and when they arrive in France, the register coming off the ship should be accepted.  We should flow on simply with the paperwork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Drennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":807,"content":"<p>That is a matter the committee can explore.

Brexit and its potential fallout comprised a recurring theme throughout.  The guest speakers were talking all things Brexit but, to my surprise, the conversation was centred mainly on air passengers travelling through the UK, with no reference to what Brexit could mean for our supply chain.  The supply chain is the roof over our heads, the clothes on our back and the food on our table, etc.  Transport drives our supply chain and thus it is the backbone of our economy.  From the conference, it became evident to me quickly that change in transport methodology was needed.<br\/><br\/>The discussions today should not just focus on damage limitation in respect of how we can avoid delays on the UK land bridge and minimise the risk and disruption of such delays; rather, we should use these discussions to understand how we can shape an autonomous supply chain, how the Government can invest in our air, sea and road freight models to deliver a supply chain infrastructure that can underpin our economy and express our vision as a country to prospective foreign direct investors and opportunities in the e-commerce and logistics space.  <br\/><br\/>My expertise specifically relates to the air freight model, which is built on the components of speed and time-definite delivery.  I began my career in freight forwarding in 1981.  I have worked at home and abroad in leading senior management positions, and I became CEO of one of Ireland's leading mid-west freight-forwarding companies.  The company ceased trading during the economic crash in 2009 and I have worked as a consultant since then.  This experience has allowed me to evaluate Brexit and identify the three key risks that present themselves to the air freight modelfrom 1 January.<br\/><br\/>Before I move on to the risk assessment, it is important to provide context.  The most recent Irish air freight study outlined how air freight represented less than 1% of the export volume but equated to 30% of total exports by value.  This is also representative of global trends.  The exports of 2019 were valued at &euro;152 billion so clearly air freight is an extremely important cog in the Irish economic machine.  To break down that number further, we estimate that more than half of that air freight is currently using the UK land bridge for global forwarding from UK and EU airports.  <br\/><br\/>The first and most immediate and obvious risk to this air freight model are the bottlenecks that will, and already have started, to present themselves in the UK.  Speed and time-definite delivery are foundations of our air freight model, which overnight will be in complete disarray.<br\/><br\/>The second key risk relates to the sphere of influence the UK will maintain over our supply chain after Brexit due to our over-reliance on the UK land bridge.  The purpose of Brexit is for the UK to take control of its own destiny, but a by-product of that process is that it will also assume a level of control over our supply chain.  <br\/><br\/>The final key risk identified, which is not exclusively related to the air freight model, relates to the transfer of data.  The UK land bridge will facilitate the transfer of key economic data through customs AEP and documentation to UK customs, now that the UK is a third country and trading competitor.  This is confidential economic data pertaining to our supply chain.  <br\/><br\/>The solution, unfortunately, is not the daily ferry service direct to France because this increases the key risk to the air freight model, which is speed.  The solution is a cargo air bridge service into Liege that bypasses the UK.  This will provide speed, reliability and autonomy to our air freight model and ultimately our supply chain.  The investment in the cargo air bridge service not only solves a Brexit problem but also enhances Ireland's value proposition to prospective foreign direct investors and indigenous entrepreneurs.  <br\/><br\/>I have put together an experienced team that has the skill set required to create, operate, manage and further develop a cargo air bridge service for the Irish market in the most efficient and cost-effective way.  Our team has broad experience of leadership and experience of all modes of domestic and international transport, including broad experience in logistics, avionics, IT and finance.  <br\/><br\/>The landscape of global trade has significantly changed in recent years, particularly with the emergence of e-commerce increasing the reliance on just-in-time cargo and logistics from business to end user.  It is time for Ireland's supply chain model to adapt.  It is time to put a best-in-class supply chain model in place in terms of connectivity and reliability.  The Government has an opportunity to make a clear statement to the world that we are open for business and we mean business by investing in a cargo air bridge service.  It is a simple choice: fall behind under UK control or create a world-leading air cargo hub to service current and future foreign direct investment and Irish indigenous manufacturing, including e-commerce and logistics industries supported by the Irish Government and the IDA, creating thousands of jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran O'Callaghan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Callaghan.

The route will be serviced by three ferries, each with a capacity of in the region of 125 lorries, both accompanied and unaccompanied.<br\/><br\/>DFDS Seaways Ireland was proud to announce this morning that the route will commence with the chartered ships <i>MS Visby<\/i>and <i>MV Kerry<\/i>, along with our own DFDS ship, <i>Optima Seaways<\/i>.  The route will initially be serviced with six weekly departures from each port, with a crossing time of 23 hours and 50 minutes.  From the outset, this will predominantly be seen as a freight service, reserving all cabins for freight drivers because the route has been initiated to support the Irish industry.  After Covid-19, however, we might open up to accommodating passengers.<br\/><br\/>A new company, DFDS Seaways Ireland Limited, has been formed under the stewardship of the DFDS A\/S umbrella in Denmark to develop this essential route to give direct connectivity between Ireland and mainland Europe after Brexit.  DFDS has 154 years of experience in international shipping.  It has a very large team of industry professionals on hand as it develops the new direct service.<br\/><br\/>We at DFDS are extremely pleased to offer customers in Ireland the opportunity to transport goods directly to or from other EU countries without the customs formalities and possible waiting times that the end of the Brexit transition period will bring about for the road haulage industry.  The route will be registered as a regular shipping service, ensuring all goods transported remain within the Single Market and customs union.  Over the past nine months, we have carried out extensive market research in all areas, including volume, capacity, speed, frequency and, most important, location of ports.  Both Rosslare Europort and the port of Dunkirk were selected for their strategic locations, accessibility and preparedness for Brexit, with both having systems in place to ensure direct free-flowing access for Europe-bound traffic.<br\/><br\/>Timing and frequency are important because, upon arrival in Dunkirk or Rosslare, drivers will be fully rested, will be able to continue driving immediately and will be able to reach their many major destinations within their legal driving limit.  In addition, the sea voyage will reduce the dependency on the UK land bridge and open direct opportunities for trade within the EU Single Market.  Since the announcement of our service on 27 November 2020, we have received many inquiries and bookings because many manufacturers and producers, along with haulage industry professionals, are looking for new direct routes to mainland Europe while keeping their goods within the Single Market.  The new line will create jobs and activities in Rosslare and Cork, where DFDS will be represented by new offices, and in Dunkirk.  In Ireland, the route will be led by me, as route director, and Mr. Darren Mooney, as sales and customer service director.  We are extremely grateful for the support we have received from the port of Rosslare, namely from the general manager, Mr. Glenn Carr, and his team, and from the port of Dunkirk.  Their flexibility, professionalism and excellent co-operation have enabled us to be ready with this service before the end of the transition period at the end of the year.  We are confident the service will benefit customers on both sides of the route.  We acknowledge the assistance of the Department of Transport, the Customs and Excise, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda and the Irish Road Haulage Association to date in helping us to bring this service to fruition in such a short period.<\/p><p>We look forward to continuing to work with them in the coming weeks as we prepare for the launch on 2 January.

We completely changed our views two years ago regarding the potential of Ireland.  We originally operated a route between Cork and Santander twice a week but we have now moved it from Cork to Rosslare and from Santander to Bilbao because we were slightly disappointed by the volumes at the beginning.  There was also a security issue in Santander relating to migrants.  We currently operate the service twice a week between Rosslare and Bilbao.<br\/><br\/>For the information of the committee, the service has a potential capacity of 20,000 pieces of freight per year.  In recent weeks, we have seen a surge in demand for the service, which is very pleasing.  We have gone from an average of 30 to 35 units per departure to well over 60 units.  There is capacity for up to 110 units.  It is very pleasing that Irish and Spanish hauliers are starting to use that service, which we opened two years ago in preparation for Brexit and the issues with the land bridge.  Complementary to this service, on the Ireland-France connection, with the same vessels that operate on the Rosslare-Bilbao route, we will operate a service between Rosslare and Cherbourg.  That comes in addition to Stena Line and Irish Ferries services on the route.  In 2021 we will deploy another ship, the <i>Armorique<\/i>, to travel between Cork and Roscoff, which will provide further freight capacity.<br\/><br\/>In a nutshell, Brittany Ferries will go from historically having one passenger service crossing per week on the <i>Pont-Aven<\/i>to having five departures per week in 2021 with much more freight capacity.  If my mathematics are correct, these services will be able to transport up to the equivalent of 30,000 freight units out of Ireland and directly to France or Spain.  Brittany Ferries identified there was a business case for the service, as did my colleagues in DFDS, Stena Line and Irish Ferries.  We recognise it is very important for Ireland to have these direct connections to the Continent.  Cobelfret has also has reinforced its capacity out of Ireland.  I fully understand that there is nervousness because there will still be some requirement to go across the UK and the land bridge.  However, the ferry industry has seriously developed its capacity out of Ireland.  There is still room for more freight.  For example, we are averaging 60 to 65 units per departure on our route to Spain but there is room to go to 100 units.  Of course, we will all be watching very carefully in January and February as things unfold and Brexit becomes a reality.  We will adapt upwards if there is demand for more capacity.  Those are my comments at this stage regarding Brittany Ferries and our recent development of routes out of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christophe Mathieu"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":816,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.

It is also profitable for the Luxembourg Government, with average profits in recent years of approximately &euro;200 million.

To look at another example, the German Government owns DHL.  Deutsche Bank, which is owned by the German Government, owns DB Schenker.  The logistics and freight forwarding industry is a profitable industry if it is done right.  DHL became a conglomerate through global purchasing of other companies.

I have received anecdotal evidence from hauliers that up to now they would book a service to go to a destination, maybe using the land bridge, and would have booked in either Rosslare or Dublin.  There used to be flexibility where, if a ferry was delayed, instead of going to Rosslare they could go to Dublin.  I am told that is no longer allowed, that customs are stepping in and telling drivers they must travel from where they booked and there no longer seems to be the flexibility.

Our biggest concern is that we would score own goals, that our State agencies and the way we go about our business will cause the mayhem.  It would be just crazy if we were to do that.  On customs and booking ferries, anything that has to travel has to be declared now, which it did not have to be before with the free movement of goods.  If we are going on direct ferries it is still covered in the free movement of goods, but the Irish-UK trade is 1 million movements a year.  It is a &euro;5 billion market.  It is massive and way bigger than it was in the past when there were customs in the past.  When we declare the goods that have to travel, it creates a pre-boarding number, PBN.  Declarations create an electronic envelope and all details are in the envelope.  They revert back to the laws of the customs union all the time in that we must also declare the ship we are travelling on and the identifier of the mode of transport of the goods is the ship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#E01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Drennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":833,"content":"<p>Was there flexibility before on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#E01300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":834,"content":"<p>There did not have to be because there was free movement.  There still is flexibility.  We can still change ships but we must identify the ship by its registered number.  If we change ships, and we do so all the time - if a driver comes into Holyhead and misses the 8 a.m. Stena, that driver then goes on the Irish Ferries - it happens very fluidly and quickly, but technically, the declaration is wrong.  Even though they take an easy eye on this because they know it comes, at the same time, someone in somebody's office has to go back to redeclare the goods and correct the declaration.  It just makes it cumbersome.  If they had identified the carrier of goods as the truck trailer, the whole parcel would travel the whole journey whatever way easily.  If the customs union has to be adjusted to take care of that, then it has to be adjusted.<\/p> <p>  Airfreight, for example, travels on a number.  There is a master number for the total of the consignment and they do not care how it travels around the world, through airports, any which way, because when it arrives, once it is complete and in front of the authorities who want to charge a tariff or seize it, it is fine.  However, here we have to declare everything for the big volume of goods that we move.  Such an adjustment would be a big help.<\/p> <p>  While a lot of work is done through the agencies within their agency and within their remit, which I would like to acknowledge, they would want to step outside their boxes and see how it joins together.  The connectivity of the jigsaw has not been there.  There has not been an overarching body to see what it all does.  We badly need an Irish system that speaks to the English system.  They are on two different platforms, so it is necessary to redeclare.  IT has become so sophisticated, if we create this electronic envelope, it should travel easily and not have to stop.  We have to stop if we are called by the regulatory authorities, but other than that, it should try to keep the free flow.  What I said about fish also applies to loads of beef or other agriculture commodities or any product.  When we arrive in France, the PBN will be related to the regulatory authority of the country we come into, and they know we have come through - it is all intact and sealed - and drive on.  It is free movement.  Ireland has free movement of goods in the EU, and that should be the way.  France has no discharge offices at the ports.  We have to travel six to ten miles one way or the other to discharge a document that should be done electronically.  That would let the goods flow.<\/p> <p>  The existing ferries, Stena and Irish Ferries, do a very good service to the Continent, but the timeline and the insistence on them keeping up to their schedule is crucial to Ireland and to the date and time on goods now, to make sure we get to market.  If a person is not in Rungis at 5 a.m. and is supposed to be at a French meat market, the load will be sold off, discounted somewhere, and it will be of very little value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2020121600002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Drennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":835,"content":"<p>There are too many people to welcome everyone but I thank them for coming.

That leaves a better supply line to Ireland, the best time limit for tourists later on in the arrivals and the opportunities, and lessens the time we wait on the tachograph.  This is where the container depots open up at the same time.  They are trying to pack all their business into a short period of the day and then go home.  We need a service line.  We need them to be open late into the evening so that trucks will come in, reload and not be around in the morning.  It is very simple.  When the container depots open, we must get the ones that take in the empty containers who are outside the port.  They have to mirror it.  The container operators can dictate that.  They can dictate the time they want the port open.  It must be opened or we create this.<\/p> <p>  If we look at what is coming down the line, when the ferries come in, they are at the end of the piers.  We may be called to the regulatory authorities, and for us to do that, we have to come out towards one end of the port to turn around and come in because the regulatory authorities are across the carriageway, so the inflow is being doubled.  When they are done with, it is necessary to go back on the inflow to come out again.

Some 70% of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies in the late 1970s or early 1980s were first or second generation Irish.

It should not be allowed happen in a port that is hoping to be a tier 1 port in Europe.  It cannot be allowed to happen.  Perhaps to sustain 24 hours at the start might be a little high to request, but there definitely should be 16 hours' cover of the agencies in Rosslare to keep it going.

There is considerable cost to setting up these routes and, of course, there could be some level of assistance or subsistence.  This is not necessarily on the actual routes themselves but one of the situations we have in Dunkirk is where there are clandestines and illegal immigrants, we have to put in place significant infrastructure to ensure that no illegal migrants come on board the vessels or into the trailers belonging to the hauliers that are going to use our service.

Yes, we approached the Brexit fund on several occasions and we were point-blank told there was no assistance whatsoever, and that included the various other Departments.

That is just an aside on the question, but I was just wondering whether the Republic of Ireland could work with hauliers like Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Stena, and Irish Ferries for that matter, to identify a priority list.

The Minister has told us either that there is no demand or that it is up to the hauliers to contact the ferry companies to outline their needs.  What we are hearing with regard to the Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, report is significant.  There were criticisms of it and we have heard confirmation from Mr. Coffey.  We had representatives of the ports before the committee and they had a list of things they wanted to see happen.  The first thing they wanted was staggered arrival times.  They said this could not be secured because they had been told the hauliers wanted it that way.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Russell to the committee and I thank him for joining us.  He and I have engaged a number of times over the past four years on the Brexit issue.  Brexit has been one of those once-in-a-generation issues that has taxed both of our countries.

As the Chairman said, we have spent some time talking about this over the past four years.  She describes Brexit as a generational event and it seems to have taken a generation to get nowhere.  I am pleased to join the committee today.  I am sad it is not in person as I always enjoy my regular visits to Ireland, which I have done all my life, and I look forward to being able to visit again as soon as it is possible and safe to do so.  The work the committee is doing is of great importance and I look forward to reading its report in due course.<\/p> <p>  Let me start by stating two facts, one of which will be known to the committee and one of which may not be.  The first fact is that Brexit is not something that Scotland voted for.  The Scottish Government profoundly regrets the outcome of the vote in 2016 in which Scotland voted decisively to remain a part of the EU, and that remains the position in Scotland and, of course, of the Scottish Government.  Neither can we simply vote to choose independence and to re-enter the EU.  The constitutional settlement under which we live requires a vote in the House of Commons, as well as in the Scottish Parliament, for a referendum.  It was never intended that this would be a political blockage but the current UK Government has made it one, and is resisting granting any such vote in the House of Commons.  We are, therefore, in something of a limbo but I do not intend that Scotland should be in that for very much longer, and in my portfolio I handle constitutional affairs, as well as external affairs and Europe.<\/p> <p>  I entirely agree that the disaster of no deal must be avoided and the crippling uncertainty we are experiencing needs to come to an end.  Negotiations are well past even the 59th minute of the 11th hour.  However, even if a deal is secured, the UK Government approach means it will be a very basic deal, what I call a low deal.  There is a problem in the language used to describe these things because &ldquo;deal&rdquo;, as it is used by Boris Johnson, seems to indicate there will be something to look forward to in it.  Whatever happens, businesses will face significant changes in the way they function from 1 January.  There will be disruption, there will be difficulty with some supplies, there will be dislocation in law enforcement and legal affairs and there will be problems for almost every sector of Scottish life in every community.<\/p> <p>  We have repeatedly urged the UK Government not to put Scotland or the UK through this in the midst of a pandemic but the UK Government has ignored that, as it has ignored much else.  Taking the option of an extension to the transition, which was available up to the end of June, would have been not just the sensible thing to do, but the humane thing to do.  What has been done is reckless.<\/p> <p>  In our interconnected world, it has never been more important not just to communicate, but to uphold the values that we share.  That means the Scottish Government is determined to maintain our close connections, our values-based connections, with our EU neighbours, with whom we have clear and close political, social and economic relationships, as we have across these islands.  Scotland will continue to be an outward-looking, progressive, internationalist country.<\/p> <p>  Our relationship with Ireland is particularly important.  We are cousins and I am delighted to see this relationship develop even further thanks to the work of the Scottish Government office in Dublin and the Irish Consulate General in Edinburgh.  We continue to work on bringing those relationships closer, and we are working with a view to the implementation of new procedures in that relationship.  I also want to want to reinforce the Scottish Government's unconditional support for the Good Friday Agreement.  We are committed to preserving peace on the island of Ireland, and any comparisons we make with Northern Ireland in the Brexit process are done in that spirit.  <\/p> <p>  Whatever the outcome of negotiations, we have had to work very hard to prepare for what will take place on 1 January.  As a result, we are doing significant work on mitigation activities.<\/p><p>It is still not entirely clear, for example, what will happen at Cairnryan, and what will happen in terms of goods moving across to Northern Ireland and through Northern Ireland into Ireland and the EU.  There will be increased checks no matter what happens.  Institutionally, Scotland's voice in these matters has been ignored.  I have been a member of the Joint Ministerial Committee (EU Negotiations) for the past four and a half years.  I am the only person who has remained on it for the entire process.  During that time, the committee was charged first of all by the UK Government - it is a joint committee of the UK, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales - with approving the Article 50 letter and then having oversight of the negotiations, but neither of those things has happened.  We did not see the Article 50 letter until it was sent and, in terms of oversight, we have consistently been ignored.  Now, the Internal Market Bill, which is about to finish its passage through the House of Commons, will further damage the devolution settlement.  The way in which the UK will seek to foist bad trade deals on the other nations of these islands is utterly unacceptable.  The Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Senate did not recommend consent, but there is a mechanism by which we can be overruled and we have been overruled.<\/p><p> Let me state what I believe is the bottom line in all of this.  We believe Scotland is in the process of transitioning to independence.  This process has been accelerated by Brexit but it is not caused by it.  It is a process that has been going on for more than 100 years.  All the recent opinion polls show a majority in Scotland for that, but given the nature of the UK constitution, that it is not an easy journey.  We will attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit.  We will plan to work our way through those effects next year.  We will have to acknowledge the reality of that situation, but we will also continue to plan and work for a time when we can re-enter the EU.  I look forward to working very closely with Ireland in that process and to joining Ireland within the European Union, where small independent countries can flourish.  It is a great tragedy what has happened with Brexit for the UK, but it cannot be allowed to define the future of Scotland and it will not be allowed to define it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Russell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Russell very much for his opening statement.

On the relationship issue, it is important that the Scottish Parliament and the Oireachtas are in communication.  This is one of the ways in which we can do it.  We can give evidence to committees, but we can also make sure that committees, for example, can sit in joint session and can also undertake investigations and can meet each other in circumstances in which there can be meaningful dialogue in this connection.  We do that with a range of bodies and I would like to see that happening here.  Senator Byrne and the committee members are very welcome to visit Scotland and we hope they will do so when it is possible.<\/p> <p>  I am a former education secretary in the Scottish Government.  I very much appreciate the work that is done between higher and further education institutions in the two countries.  We have been very happy to welcome Irish students.  There are difficulties in going ahead with that on the terms that we have been able to do so, given Brexit.  What we were doing was based on our opportunities under European law, but we will continue to encourage work between the institutions.  It is difficult for Scottish institutions and their research basis.  I also have a live involvement with Glasgow University.  Their access to European funding will be substantially diminished and may be cut off altogether.  It is not clear yet whether there will be continuing involvement with European programmes such Horizon, Horizon 2020 and their successors.  That is one of the problems.  If it will not be within that setting, then we will clearly not only be cut out from funding but from the wider interchange of ideas which is part of the research experience.  There are five Scottish universities among the top 200 universities, in a nation of 5 million people, so we are \"a nation of the mind\", so to speak.  Just as Edinburgh is defined as the \"capital of the mind\", we are \"a nation of the mind\" and it will be very distressing for us, for example, not to be able to lead projects which we have led up until now.  Most, if not all, Scottish institutions have been renewing and cementing their relationships with institutions across Ireland and that will need to continue.  I think it will continue.  Opportunities will be sought for joint academic and research activity.<\/p> <p>  On fisheries, we have taken a very clear view that we are not the negotiating party.  Much as we have been tempted to give our view on every detail of the negotiations, we have not done so.  We feel it is best that the negotiation takes place without a constant commentary from us.  As we wish to re-enter the EU, we clearly are conscious of the shortcomings of the Common Fisheries Policy for Scottish fishing communities.  We are also conscious of the fact that fishing in Scotland is not a homogenous industry.  I represent 23 inhabited islands on the west coast of Scotland and their inshore fishing is a very different industry from that, for example, of the major fleet in the north east.  Interestingly, fishing boats and enterprises from the area will be able to choose to land in Northern Ireland if they are able to do so after 1 January because they may be able to sell directly into the EU, which would not be possible if they landed in Scotland.  There will be a problem for processing and another problem will be selling the goods.  One can catch as much as one wants, but if one cannot sell it to people then one does not have a business.  People in my area are involved in selling seafood, which is very problematic.  Many of the catches here are sent directly to Spain and that transportation is very quick, but if there is any delay or hold-up then there is a problem.  If one sells live langoustines to restaurants in Paris and they are sitting on a motorway in Kent for seven days then, by definition, they are no longer alive.  There are problems to be dealt with in that regard.  I will not give a preference in terms of the negotiations, other than that the negotiations must be clear to all parties and must make sure the Scottish fishing industry is viable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Russell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Russell.  It is good to see him again, even if it is just virtually on this occasion.  I look forward to seeing him at our next plenary, wherever that might be.<\/p> <p>  I will make a couple of points and then I will ask a question.  It is heartening and uplifting to engage with someone who is a Cabinet secretary with responsibility for constitutional affairs.  My experience in this institution is that when one mentions constitutional affairs and a change in them, it gives rise to gasps and sometimes a wee bit of outrage.  It is positive to hear that the Scottish experience is putting forward that.<\/p> <p>  It is also encouraging that Mr. Russell mentioned support for Scotland's return to the EU.  The North has an opportunity to return to the European institutions.  That is provided for in the democratically endorsed Good Friday Agreement, a route for which I am sure many in Scotland would give their right arm, but that is something we should look to and laud given the democratic endorsement for it in this State.<\/p> <p>  In terms of preparing and planning for constitutional change, will Mr. Russell give us his view on how important he believes that to be in terms of properly planning, informing, engaging and having dialogue on any constitutional change?  Some of it is very sensible in the course of the Brexit dialogue and the trauma that has been inflicted on both Scotland and the North of Ireland, both of which voted to remain in the EU.  I say that within the context of the Scottish experience, which is not entirely separate from its campaign for independence, and in terms of the work of this committee, and understanding the importance of preparing and planning for future constitutional change within the context of providing against the shock, negativity and harm caused to us both by an unwanted Brexit<\/p><p>Anything I say is clearly within the context of Scottish constitutional politics.  I would not dare to assume that I would come into constitutional politics elsewhere.  All constitutional politics are different.  I have been the cabinet secretary with responsibility for the constitution over a period of time.  Indeed, ten years ago I had responsibility for the constitution of the Scottish Government.  That remains a constant.  As we have been debating the constitution in Scotland for well over 100 years, this is not a particular shock to us.  There was an old joke in the 1970s, when devolution was first fully on the agenda, that the only difference between devolution and evolution was that devolution took longer.  In Scotland, we are quite used to spending time considering these matters.<\/p><p> We fully understand the need for the arrangements that have been made for Northern Ireland and absolutely support them.  However, it makes us reflect upon a truism, which is that Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit and has been treated in a special way.  Wales voted, regrettably and narrowly, for Brexit and has had Brexit.  England voted for Brexit and has had Brexit.  Scotland is the only country that voted for something and has had nothing.  Scotland did not vote for Brexit and yet is being forced into that situation.  That was not necessary.  It was perfectly possible to envisage a different way forward.  We published a series of papers, starting in December 2016, called Scotland's Place in Europe and put forward a range of options and compromises, which fell on deaf ears.  The process of Brexit is one in which there has been a steady rightward movement of the UK Government and that Government has been less and less willing to compromise or to listen to any other voices.  The tragedy of Brexit is that if there had been a discussion about everybody getting something in 2016, we would not be in the extraordinary, damaging and chaotic mess in which we now find ourselves.<\/p><p> All I can say on the wider constitutional issue is that Scotland is quite clear that we need to move on.  It is clear even to those who do not support independence that the situation needs to be resolved.  Any means of doing so has to be an inclusive process.  We learned a great deal from the Citizens' Assembly experience in Ireland.  Indeed, I visited Ireland to look specifically at that some time ago and went back to Scotland with it.  I had responsibility for all constitutional affairs, including that, and we established a Scottish citizens' assembly which is just coming to the end of its initial deliberations, despite the pandemic.  It has been a difficult experience for it.  We believe in inclusion and that this has to be an inclusive process and we are trying to achieve that.  The referendum we had on independence in 2014 was a very positive thing.  Some disagree and we learned from that.  It was a very positive and energising thing and I want the current process to be the same.  Regrettably, we live in a time of polarised politics.

However, we have to move on from where we are.  On the future and where we are going, where does Mr. Russell see the future of the UK going forward, as a result of Brexit?  Scotland had its own referendum back in 2014 but I just wanted to know how he sees things in the UK progressing.  There is some work going on behind the scenes on the relationship between Ireland and Scotland, by both Governments.  When does Mr. Russell expect to have a final report on those discussions?  What future does he envision between both our islands, bearing in mind that Scotland will be outside the EU?  What can we expect in that regard and what limitations are there?  Mr. Russell mentioned the Dublin office earlier, as did the Chairman.

We are expanding that network and will continue to expand it and the Dublin office will continue to be very important to us.  I pay tribute to John Webster, who is listening in to this meeting and who has run that office.  I want to make sure we do even more than we have done.<\/p> <p>  The review of the relationship is ready to be launched.  Clearly, the difficulties with Brexit have been a problem in getting that done, along with everything else that is going on.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and I have essentially signed off on the outcomes of the review.  The process was very productive.  We learned a great deal and I was very lucky to spend a bit of time in Galway during the most recent election talking to people and as I already knew, the similarities between my own constituency and what was being done in the west of Ireland were massive.  There are whole areas where we can work together and we have identified and laid out those areas, plus the structures we put in place for regular meetings and annual reviews.  This is a very productive thing.  It is the first time we have done it and I believe it is the first time Ireland has done it.  It will give a good structure to ensure our relationship flourishes. <\/p> <p>  The question of what happens to the UK needs to be divided in two parts.  Constitutionally, the UK is in a process of flux but that is not new.  It may have accelerated but it is not new and it is certainly not new in terms of the Scottish issue.  How the UK relates to the world and places itself in the world will depend very much on the current UK Government and any future UK Government.  The current UK Government believes that there is a thing called \"global Britain\", mistakenly believes that there is some glorious past which can be returned to, and believes that it will become a beacon of free trade and buccaneering activity.  I personally think that is misguided, to use the kindest possible word.  It does not pay any attention to current reality.  The Senator said we should pay attention to reality and we accept that the UK has already left the EU and that the transition period will end on 31 December.  The reality I am looking for is a grounded sense of reality about our interdependence.  We live in an interdependent world.  Scotland will pursue that and I would like to see the UK pursue it.  However, I am not persuaded that that will happen.  Therefore, we will have to make our arrangements first to say who and what we are and then make our linkages as productive as we can with everybody, but we will not be told what to do.  Devolution is a delicate dance around Westminster sovereignty.  That dance has to stop and we have to all behave like adults and equals.  That is what we are looking to do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Russell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>Mr. Russell is very welcome and I thank him for joining us.  This is a very interesting exchange.  There have been huge bonds between Scotland and Ireland in geographical and cultural terms, and in every sphere, over the years.  In that context I am delighted that the Government has initiated a review of our bilateral relations.  That review began in 2019 and will hopefully develop.  I would be interested in Mr. Russell's response to this.  I am not sure of the level of it at the moment but given the cultural links I see great potential to increase the tourism product between Scotland and Ireland, in a post-Brexit context, as part of a bilateral review.  There would be great opportunities, particularly in the part of Ireland in which I and a few colleagues here live, north of Athlone and north of the centre of Ireland.  There is great potential for further linkages in that area.  I would be interested in Mr. Russell's response to that.<\/p> <p>  In that context, we welcome the Dublin office.  A few of the previous speakers addressed the question I was going to raise, which is the degree to which, ironically and paradoxically enough, Brexit has authors and support among very strong unionist people in the UK.<\/p><p>I refer to people who are nationalistic in the context of the UK.  Ironically, those people are likely to cause the break-up of the UK.  I apologise if the witness has already addressed this issue, because I was slightly late coming in, but what is the timeframe regarding and the level of support for independence in Scotland now?  In a post-Brexit context, when is it likely that we might see a referendum which could result in Scottish independence?  How quickly might we then see Scotland back in the EU?<\/p><p> In addition, does the witness see trade being slowed and choked up because of the workings of customs processes between the UK and Ireland?  Will that situation bring great delays in trade?  Turning to the topic of agriculture, what will happen to that sector in the UK now?  Is it likely to turn inward and seek to supply the domestic market?  Agricultural products from the UK were being exported to Europe.  In a post-Brexit situation, if they turn inward, what will be the future for farmers and the agricultural sector in the UK?  I thank Mr. Russell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#C00400","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":1036,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for that range of questions.  Let me start with the review.  I agree that tourism is a key issue.  We essentially have to reconsider and reinvent tourism after the pandemic.  It will not be the same.  The area which I represent is extremely rural and includes islands, and the tourism industry there has been badly affected by the pandemic.  It has been a year of three winters.  What we need to do is rebuild that industry, but to rebuild it in a sustainable way.  I am sure the review will contribute to doing that and that the joint product will be an exciting one.<br\/><br\/>There are other things in the report, however.  There are references to the food and drinks sector, for example, and I will come back to that when we talk about agriculture.  The other issues addressed concern energy, cultural exchange, climate change, depopulation and rurality, which I think we can address, and language.  Those are all things we need to look at in this context, and they are strands on which we can build and develop.  I am sure we are going to do that as a result of the review, which is a very positive thing.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the issue of trade, I think it is impossible to tell what will happen.  The biggest pressure undoubtedly lies in the short straits and some of the English ports.  That will be problematic.  How much this issue will come up between Northern Ireland and Scotland, and how difficult it will be, will depend on volume, phytosanitary inspections and how much would be waived through in the first six months, which is a worrying thing from my perspective regarding in respect of what that might mean.  It is not going to be business as usual, however.  Another element concerns how well prepared people are.  It is understandable but still concerning that many companies have, inevitably, been focused on Covid-19 rather than Brexit, and therefore the level of preparation may be lower than we would want.<br\/><br\/>Moving onto the issue of agriculture, a no-deal Brexit will mean that the imposition of tariffs will be very damaging.  If we look at Scots and Welsh lamb, for example, a tariff of over 60% would just completely destroy that trade, so there are problems in this area.  We have responsibility for setting agricultural support in the Scottish Parliament, and we have indicated that this should be what we think we will be a period of transition and security.  We are not, therefore, trying to make enormous changes to agricultural support.  The UK Government, however, seems to want to make much more profound changes in agricultural supports.  We are, though, much more often supporting people on marginal land.  Agricultural support is not homogenous, just as fishing is not homogenous, and that impacts on what we do and how we put forward agricultural support supports.<br\/><br\/>It also impacts on how we relate the agricultural sector to the food and drinks industries.  There has been an enormous growth in those industries in Scotland in the last ten years.  We have been in government for 13 years, and one of our priorities when we entered government was to expand the food and drinks industries.  We, or more accurately the people of Scotland, have very much succeeded.  These industries are vitally important and they will be hit by what is about to happen.  As the committee knows, food supply chains are difficult things.  It is not necessarily easy to divert local products into local chains, because there are issues with price and sustainability in that process.  We are looking at all those aspects, however.  I hope the future of agriculture is bright, but it will be difficult and it will be a difficult period for people in that sector.<br\/><br\/>On the subject of what will happen with the referendum, as I said in my opening remarks, which the Senator may have missed and I am sorry about that, it is not in our gift to simply hold a referendum.  If it was, we would have done that by now.  It must be agreed between the Scottish Parliament and the House of Commons.  It was a positive mechanism when the Scotland Act was originally passed in 1998.  Alex Salmond and I negotiated that with the then Government of the UK and the Secretary of State for Scotland, the late Donald Dewar.  It meant that there was no glass ceiling to devolution, because there was a mechanism through which the people of Scotland could move on.<br\/><br\/>Reading the debates on that Bill will make it clear that the intention was that the mechanism was to be automatic, so that if the people of Scotland chose to have a referendum they could do so.  It has essentially been weaponised by the current UK Government, and its predecessor, to state that there cannot be agreement because it will not allow a referendum to be held.  The response of the same people in government in London can be imagined if the EU had told them that they were not allowed to have a referendum on Brexit.  The sky would have fallen in, but that is the position we are in.  It is an issue we must address and we will address it through the upcoming Scottish Parliament elections in May.  <br\/><br\/>Support for independence has not fluctuated much since the referendum in 2014, where the final result was 54% to 45%, although there was one period in the last ten days before that referendum where the &quot;Yes&quot; vote had been ahead.  The last 16 opinion polls in Scotland have now put support for independence ahead of opposition to it, and that is very positive.  Like most things in Scotland, however, we will treat that with caution.  We have a big set of arguments and debates to be had on this subject, but the first thing we must do is to get that referendum and get the referendum Bill passed.  We have already set the franchise and done the technical work in that regard.  We now need a short Bill which turns the key on this referendum process and posits the question and the timescale.  I have repeatedly said that I hope a referendum could be held reasonably quickly.  We have decided and made it clear as a party that we will publish the final part of the referendum Bill before the elections in May.  We will put that Bill to the people in the election.  If people who endorse it are elected, then we will pass the Bill rapidly and move quickly to a referendum.  I can see no reason that should not take place next year.  It is certainly desirable to have it soon.<br\/><br\/>We must also ensure that this matter does not drag out and create insecurity or uncertainty.  We want to ensure that this decision is made by the people of Scotland and that we can then move on.  After that, there will be a process to be gone through in joining the EU.  We have observed the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i>for nearly 50 years and done many of the things required, but there will be a process and we will have to go through it.  It just depends on what it looks like.  In the process of accession, of course, the debate and argument and the way we move forward will be different.  I hope all of us will approach it in a constructive spirit, if the people in Scotland indicate that that is what they want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Russell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Russell.

Mr. Russell has commented on the tourism aspect.  From a sporting perspective, we were drawn in the same rugby group only the other day, for example, and we are obviously going to be closer in this area as well in the coming years.  I wanted to touch on the tourism aspect, in particular, because, as Mr. Russell said in his reply to Senator O'Reilly, increasing our contacts in that area will be so important post Covid.

Of course, the review is part of the process to make sure we are not put at a remove.  It would not happen in tourism or other areas.

Taking into account the key industries that I always look to, I believe Scotland has an amazing distillery industry.  It probably has the world's most renowned distilleries.  Over the past ten years, the work done in the food and drink industry in Scotland has been amazing.  Particularly where distilleries are concerned, Scotland is way ahead of the rest of the world in so many regards.  How prepared are the industries for what will happen in the next few months considering the tariffs and all the extra work associated with exports and regulation that never had to be done before?<\/p> <p>  There has been commentary in Ireland that Irish companies are of the view that the UK side of the water has not bought into the changes that are going to be very much apparent in the coming months.

I am not confident that industry of any nature is fully prepared.  That is the experience in the UK as a whole.  There are a number of problems.  One is the concurrence with Covid, added to the winter pressures and the fact that Covid has dominated companies' thinking, as it must have done over recent months and will continue to do.  A lack of preparedness will be an issue.<\/p> <p>  There are some things that cannot be prepared for.  If one does not know what the situation will be, it is impossible to prepare for it.  That has been a disincentive.  People have thrown up their hands and asked how they can prepare if they do not know what to prepare for.  There is a feeling that people have been lulled into a false sense of security over the fact that this is the third approach regarding no deal.  It has worked out twice before but people do not realise this time that a deal, while not quite as bad as none, will be pretty bad.  Also to be considered is the general recession that will come out of this.  The figures in this regard are clear.  There will be a hit to the UK economy, including the Scottish economy.  Added to the Covid hit, there will be a comparative slowdown, even worse than that across the EU.  Therefore, we have big issues to address here.<\/p> <p>  Let me take the whisky industry as an example.  I represent in the Scottish Parliament the second largest number of distilleries.  My colleague Mr. Richard Lochhead represents the Spey distilleries.  I represent Islay, Jura, Campbeltown and such areas.  The whisky industry has seen a boom, of course.  It has continued to grow.  There are two new distilleries on Islay alone, and a third in planning.  There is a very strong view that the whisky industry will grow and expand forever.  The demand for whisky will continue, I am sure, but the supply chain is difficult.  Bruichladdich Distillery, one of the most imaginative whisky distilleries in Scotland, based on Islay, told me very graphically three years ago that its bottles came from France.  How was it to deal with that?  The design of a bottle is very important.  It was a question of whether people could pick up the slack in the UK.  Much glasswork is done in the Czech Republic and some is done in Poland.  How does one get the supply chains altered?  A lot of work has gone into that, and it probably has happened.<\/p> <p>  What the whisky industry hopes for is no great interruption to trade.  WTO tariffs are not as critical in this case as they are in some others.  A continuing willingness to purchase is required.  There are competitors but Scotch malt whisky is a unique product.  On continued geographical issues, protection of geographical indicators is a problem.  It is absolutely clear that the US producers would like to be able to call their products Scotch whisky and Scotch malt whisky, which would be a problem.  All these factors have to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Why on earth are we doing this?  It is the most extraordinary waste of time, effort and money that could have been spent elsewhere.  Added to that, Scotland did not vote for Brexit.  It is all tragic, as I have already been quoted as saying.  It is extremely disturbing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Russell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Russell for his ongoing interaction with us.

That would be really useful.<\/p><p>For a long time, Ireland has positioned itself not with cap in hand but in such a way as to demand that it be regarded as the part of the EU, recognising its geographical isolation.  We often talk about being on the periphery of Europe.  This is where I see so many connections with Scotland.  Scotland is still on the periphery of Europe geographically but it is no longer in the EU.  It is also on the periphery of the UK.  Ireland is still part of the European Union but we share and will share some very considerable issues that have been addressed by others.  It is imperative that we begin without delay to engage in dialogue and put in place an appropriate platform whereby we can share our concerns and try to forge a relationship that looks to solutions, notwithstanding the position that Scotland will have in the UK, for however long that might be.  How long Scotland remains in the UK is a matter for itself but there is now an opportunity for us, through our shared history and shared vision for the future, to determine how we can protect our economies to the greatest extent possible.  While it is difficult at this remove to know where the synergies might lie, it is important that we begin the process.  In my time as a member of this committee, I will be trying to push for a much closer relationship between Scotland and Ireland, albeit in an <i>ad hoc<\/i>way because Scotland will not be part of the EU.  Clearly, Ireland does not want to be part of the UK.  An essential part of our relationship will involve trying to forge closer links with the UK to the benefit of citizens here, in the Six Counties in the north of our country and in Scotland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#E00400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I would be very keen to see that done.

It stands in stark contrast with the position we have found ourselves in.  We look at the Irish position with envy because there has been solidarity and an understanding of the Irish perspective.  We have not had such treatment in the union of which we are currently part.  We hope we will be able to rejoin the EU in a way that would reflect our two states' important common ground.

The rest of the UK is our most significant trading partner.  There is a social union.  Not only was I born in England but my mother and my grandfather were born there too, meaning there is a strong social union.  What is important is putting that relationship on the basis of equality.  Without that equality, the relationship cannot be as good as it should be.  We recognise that and we are all in the same position on that one.<\/p> <p>  On Dover, I do not think I know more officially than what the Chairman does.  We simply do not get the information we need to have.  We are able to glean information, however, and understand it in the context of the two rounds of previous preparations for a no-deal Brexit.  The real issues will be how long the delays will be, how long any inspections will take and how long any paperwork will take.  The recent exercise in which each lorry was subject to 45 seconds of additional inspection led to a massive queue at Dover.  If there was any industrial action of any description or reluctance from European hauliers to come into UK, then we would see substantial disruption.  This is why these lorry parks have been established and there will be a system of permits for lorries going in and out of Kent.  If any possible weather disruption - that is not impossible in the winter - is added to that, there could be a situation where there could be significant shortages.  It would not be hunger but it would be significant shortages.  If a person is used to buying an avocado every week, then he or she might not be able to get one.  It could be much more serious than that too.<\/p> <p>  We would expect any such shortages to show up after 1 January.  There has been significant stockpiling by supermarkets, suppliers and others.  It is hard to do that during the Christmas season when there is a large amount of stock in any case.  One just has to put things in places.  It is the worst time of year for that because warehousing is at a premium.  We would expect, however, that there would be no immediate impact up until 31 December.  Then there would be an emerging impact on food supplies and other things going both ways.  Food exports, particularly, could be affected with a slowdown in activity.<\/p> <p>  Some of the problems we have seen in the run-up to Christmas because of stockpiling and additional goods coming in could ease the situation.  It is difficult to tell, however.  The UK Government itself has admitted that food prices will rise and it anticipates some shortages.<\/p> <p>  On business support, the UK itself has undertaken information schemes and so have we.  We have worked through our banking group, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to make sure that there is availability of information.  We have targeted particular key players.  Like Ireland, Scotland is a smallish country and we can do that.  Those countries we know that are likely to be affected, we will be able to target them.  There are many small hauliers, individual drivers and small businesses which may have put off dealing with Brexit or have been badly affected by Covid.  We will not know the effect of that until what happens on 31 December and the outcome of the negotiations.  There may be a period of grace, which many people have asked for.  In that case, it would ease any restrictions happening.<\/p> <p>  On medical supplies, we are focused on making sure supply is maintained.  The National Health Service was established in 1947 as a devolved organisation.  Accordingly, we have control of the Scottish National Health Service.  We have been working with the UK on category 1 supplies to ensure that all three nations - Scotland, England and Wales - can guarantee priority transport for medicines and medical devices, as well as veterinary medicines.<\/p> <p>  We have also undertaken our own stockpiling in addition to the UK stockpiling.  We are comfortable that we have enough supplies.  If I remember correctly from the figures from last week, 88% of the items we have tended to stockpile are there while the other 12% are due to come over either this or next week.  We believe that we have done enough to resolve that issue.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of substitutions.  The Scottish formulary for prescribing is slightly different from that in England.  That is a product of different health services.  There has been a requirement for us to do some things differently, which we have.  We also stand ready to put in place additional measures.  That is why our equivalent to the UK's Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms, COBR, the Scottish Government Resilience Room, SGoRR, was stood up ten days ago on a daily basis.  That is why our local resilience partnerships are now in operation, a team of senior ministers meets to deal with winter resilience, which are recurrent risk issues, and the smaller group of senior ministers will start daily meetings immediately after Christmas.  We are prepared and preparing.  We will go on doing so for as long as we can.<\/p> <p>  We are also dealing with staff in these circumstances who have been on the front line since the start of the Covid pandemic.  There has been a considerable strain on them, which is an issue we are concerned about.  It will produce an additional burden on all of these people who are helping our society as it is.  That is yet another example of the tragedy of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Russell"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>Scotland seems to have done a huge amount of preparatory work by the sounds of it and taken similar approaches to those we have taken.

I thank members of the committee.  I just ended a phone call with members of the Friends of Ireland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis.  We had a lengthy conversation with him about Brexit and its ramifications.  I should tell the committee by way of introduction that it is a long-standing interest of many of us, myself included, to see the success of the Good Friday Agreement as one of the paramount achievements of American foreign policy.  My own interest and involvement began with the hunger strikes in the North more than three decades ago.  I remember how difficult that was as it was conveyed to us here in America, with the long-standing friendship and loyalties that we have because of parents and grandparents born on that island.  That in some measure is a reflection of how American foreign policy has always manifested itself as a reflection of domestic politics.  We have played a strong and sturdy role in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement and as a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  I have one important observation, having engaged with numerous British Prime Ministers, Secretaries of State and Members of Parliament.  Speaker Pelosi and I met with the Brexiteers on behalf of the Friends of Ireland.  It was not one of the more cordial get-togethers that we had.  It is important to remember that there were three strands of the Good Friday Agreement.  Strand two included Belfast and Dublin, and removing that Border.  It has worked beyond all of our imaginations.  Government is back up and running in the North.  People argue about the more mundane issues of the day.  During the more difficult moments, as the Irish protocol was threatened, I raised this issue assertively with Prime Minister May, Members of Parliament and also with the Irish Government.  Our argument was asking why we would jeopardise the success of the Good Friday Agreement, given that it brought to an end the longest-standing political dispute in the history of the western world.<\/p> <p>  The statistics here are most valuable.  Some 30 years ago, there were 30,000 British soldiers in the North of Ireland in a geographic area the size of the state of Connecticut.  One could not move or go anywhere and one tradition held the other tradition in place.  Policing was unfair.  Economic opportunity was in many instances almost non-existent.  The success that we have witnessed to this day is hardly perfect.  We have not come to believe that they have all fallen in love with each other but in the crucible of politics, we think that they have developed a path forward.  In the conversation that we have just had with the Secretary of State, we encouraged a reminder of that success and said that there could be no jeopardy by returning to a Border or the threat of a Border.<\/p> <p>  I think the Border was an invented issue or dispute that was raised in Brexit.  In the conversations that I had with the foreign minister, Mr. Raab, when he flew here to see me twice and met with Speaker Pelosi, he made the argument that it was the European Union that was jeopardising a return to the Border.  We took a contrary position and said that was not the case.  Speaker Pelosi, to her credit, sided with us on this issue.  In the recent visit that we had, when I spoke with her and said that I thought there was an active effort being made to discourage us from visiting the Border, she said to me that we are going to the Border.  I could not have been any happier.  We went to the Border and pointed out the success that we have all had a chance to witness, all of these \"it could never happen\" moments.  We have reminded the Secretary of State, British Prime Ministers and members of the British Government that there can be no jeopardy to the Good Friday Agreement.  That visit drew considerable attention across the Republic of Ireland and the North.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the committee and Members of the Oireachtas.  Political parties in the Republic have been extraordinarily helpful by all seeing this from the same vantage point.  There have been efforts in the past to divide Members of the Oireachtas over some of the more nuanced parts of the discussion that have taken place in the North.  Members' unwavering support of us has made it considerably less difficult as we offer a plausible path forward.  I thank the committee and would be happy to take any questions that members might have.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative currently has adopted my position and I have a good working relationship with it.  The trade representative's successor, Katherine Tai, is a member of my staff and she understands fully the position we have adopted.

His constituents questioned Mr. Neal's involvement and he said it was because it was the right thing to do.  What Mr. Neal is doing now is obviously vitally important because without Irish-America and without the pressure put on the UK Government to make sure it abides by the Good Friday Agreement and abides by the undertakings it has given in this Brexit process, we would not be in the position we are today where the Border remains open.

Equally, as Mr. Neal will be aware, the success of support in the United States of America has been because of working across the aisle with Democrats and Republicans.  It has, perhaps, been a little bit challenging with the White House over recent years.  It might be unfair to ask a Massachusetts Democrat, but on the importance for us of also working with the Republican Party, where does Mr. Neal believe that party will go with regard to its relationship with Ireland, the UK and the European Union?<\/p> <p>  My second question is broader.  There is an opportunity now, and especially with a Biden Presidency, for the European Union and the United States of America to work more closely on trade issues and in tackling some of those global challenges, including climate change.

We were full partners and never had a word of disagreement as it related to the North, and we are also good friends.  I like former Congressman Jim Walsh, a Republican from New York.  This morning I was on a call with the Secretary of State where Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, could not have been any more aggressive in his questioning of the Secretary of State about the Pat Finucane murder, because that is what it was.  We have always tried to keep this bipartisan and bicameral, and I believe we have succeeded in doing such.  This is one of the reasons it worked.<br\/><br\/>The Friends of Ireland, which was founded by Speaker O'Neill, a friend to me, was based upon the idea that what was taking place in the United States of America because of gun running had to be brought to heel.  The trade-off for that was there had to be a serious discussion about addressing the inequities that had existed for the nationalist people in the North of Ireland.  The plan that was developed, the Friends of Ireland, was to try always to be an honest broker while understanding that one of the traditions might not always see it that way.  At the same time, they always got a hearing in the United States of America.  They might not have liked the answer but they did get a hearing.  Speaker O'Neill's vision in establishing Friends of Ireland was meant to offset the primordial grievances that many of us felt about the North and how human rights had been handled there.  He befriended many of the people over the years and came in time to be friends with members of both traditions on that sort of basis.  It is our understanding, even to this day, when one hears some of the words from people like Mr. Peter Robinson and some of the comments that have been made by Baroness Paisley and many others, that they are light years away from where these positions may have been adopted 30 years ago, and so I am very encouraged.<br\/><br\/>On the multilateral trade agreement, the committee might reference a piece I authored in <i>The New York Times <\/i>just four or five days ago, in which I took the position that a multilateral trade agreement between the United States of America and the European Union would be the best way to address the more aggressive posture that China has adopted around the world.  The most important bilateral economic relationship, and perhaps military relationship, in the world is now that which exists between the United States of America and China.  Managing that relationship is essential.<br\/><br\/>One of the best ways to do this is to engage fully and remind people that the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiation that I urged former President Obama to juxtapose with the Transition to Practice, TTP, plan, is fully engaged.  I have had conversations with President-elect Biden and I believe that he shares my view on this.  He has, by and large, been a free trade Senator and a free trade Vice President, and I believe he will take those sensibilities to the White House with him also.  It would allow us to address climate change, as the Senator has aptly described, and the intercedence of American democracy in some manner or reflection of the long history we have had in our relationship with the European Union.  Engaging that process makes a good deal of sense to me.  That is a welcome question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Neal"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>As Senator O'Reilly must take the Chair in a few moments, I will let him in now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#H00800","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, Chairman.

I welcome the remarks that he made during an online discussion on Ireland's future.  He said that he hopes to see Irish unity, and I do too.  I thank him for his continued support and I hope that a united Ireland will be delivered without undue delay.<\/p> <p>  Congressman Neal has spoken at length that there would be no trade deal, on which the outgoing Congress was very clear, between the UK and the US if the Good Friday Agreement was jeopardised or a hard border was imposed.  I do not think there should be any border in Ireland but there certainly should not be a rowing back and imposition of a border as it causes great economic, societal and political harm.  I welcome the fact that Congressman Neal has very clearly and directly reaffirmed that commitment here today.  As welcome and as positive as our engagement has been, part of the rationale for meeting today was to provide him with a platform to reaffirm and assert the commitment as directly and bluntly as he has done.<\/p> <p>  I will make two brief observations and then ask Congressman Neal two questions.  As he will know, the Good Friday Agreement pertains to issues of more than trade and permeates into all aspects of life on this island.  As he probably will have guessed, I hail from the second city of Ireland, which is Belfast.  I live in the North but I am a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann that meets in Dublin.  Congressman Neal has referred to strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement, which refers to the North-South institutions and arrangements.  Crucial in the context of Brexit is the rights agenda.  There are 156 cross-Border co-operation schemes.  The British Government continues to call for the scrapping of all or parts of the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, the application of the convention is a core component of the Good Friday Agreement.  The convention is hardwired into the agreement.  No one knows what type of Brexit we will end up with on 1 January, but we know there will be no good outcome for this island, just varying degrees of harm.  Would Congressman Neal be willing to report or audit the application of Brexit against the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements to ensure that all parts of the agreement are protected in advance of a British-US trade deal?<\/p> <p>  The Cathaoirleach, Senator Daly, has invited Congressman Neal to visit the Seanad in person, and I hope to see him.  Is it fitting and timely, health restrictions allowing, for a Congressional delegation to visit Ireland in the new year to see first-hand how Brexit is working out?  We look forward to working with the Congressman, not just in the immediate days ahead as we face into Brexit but also beyond that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#J00600","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>Yes, I would be more than happy personally to help to audit the agreement as it was originally reached.  We could do that, I think, with great authority after a special envoy is named here.  I think that that would be very helpful to the process as well as we engage.<\/p> <p>  As Cathaoirleach Daly pointed out, my mother's family, the Garveys, hail from Ventry that is located on the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry.  I wish to add that one of my grandmothers was born in Banbridge, County Down.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile mentioned Belfast.  If anybody ever wants to see the success of what the peace dividend has meant then they can take a look at Belfast today.  I know that there are always challenges and hurdles but it is amazing to see what has happened to the city.  When I visited the city 30 years ago, it was war torn, but today there is a fledgling sense of optimism and new prosperity, much of which can be attached to the success of the Good Friday Agreement.  I also think that the announcement about a new investment made by the UK Government promotes the idea of all-Ireland institutions, which we thing are essential.  For the better part of decades tourists from across America who had relatives who were from the North never visited because the daily reports of strife in the region kept millions of people from visiting, particularly from visiting the spectacular vista along the coast.  All of that is a reminder of a new day.  There are now two generations of children who have grown up without knowing the violence and mayhem that confronted people every day in that small geographic area.

I was always taken by the extent to which he and others were absolutely in tune with the political discourse that was taking place here and had a clear understanding of what was at stake.<\/p><p> The Congressman probably thought his work was done when he had played such a crucial role, with others, in bringing the peace process around.  He did so through working with former President Clinton to forge a major breakthrough by assisting in getting Gerry Adams a visa.  That was probably one of the greatest breakthroughs in helping to break down the barriers that existed.  I was very taken by a recent interview the Congressman gave to RT&Eacute; in which he compared the time prior to the peace process with the modern era.  He gave his experience of two trips across the Border.  Many of the younger generation, as well as some others who chose to ignore the situation at the time, fail to understand the significance of the Border or the impact it had on the people who lived along it.  The Congressman eloquently described a time prior to the peace process when he and several of his colleagues sought to cross the Border by bus.  He spoke about members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, coming on board the bus and going through the normal process and the impact that had on him and his colleagues.  He then spoke about a later time when he saw the culmination of his work and the impact it had on people's lives and how important it was to see that.  I think that contribution was really important during the Brexit process because it helped to bring back in a very distinct way the real negative side of the imposition of a hard border, albeit an economic one as envisaged in a hard Brexit.  I thank him for his really important work at this crucial time.  When he, as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, made that contribution, together with a very strong declaration by Speaker Pelosi, it sent shivers down certain spines.  It certainly dismantled an argument that was being proffered by successive UK Prime Ministers that somehow there was a better deal available to the UK - that somehow there was a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow, and it was located in Congressman Neal's great country.  As the television programme goes, he bust that myth.  I thank him for doing that.  It took a person of his standing, together with Speaker Pelosi, to undermine that argument.  His intervention came at a critical time.  I cannot overstate the role he has played in those discussions.<\/p><p> That contribution comes from the wider approach taken by, quite frankly, the bipartisan group that for a long time saw the benefits of a strong Europe and a good relationship between the United States and Europe.  Sadly, that has been sullied in the past four years by the incumbent US President.  I am very hopeful as a result of the election of President-elect Biden, whom I have met on numerous occasions and who is a friend of Ireland, as Congressman Neal knows well in terms of his relationship with the President-elect.  There is an important role to be played in moving away from the America first policy and, as has been done in the past, reaching out not in fear, but in the knowledge of strength of the Congressman's country.  That will enable it to be a great superpower again and to forge its link with Europe such that all citizens can benefit from the two blocks working together.  That approach would stand in contrast to the policy that has been espoused by the current US President for the past four years, which has involved the notion of putting America first by trampling on the hopes and dreams of others.  That is something the Congressman has always sought to address and we are really thankful to him for that.<\/p><p> At the end of that very long monologue, my question is whether the Congressman believes that, with the election of President-elect Biden and the passage from office of President Trump, there is a better chance that Republicans and Democrats will work better or more collectively in a bipartisan way on the big foreign policy issues.  I know they have squabbles about budgets and issues domestically, as we do here, but when it comes to important foreign policy, the narrow-minded policy of putting America first, as espoused by President Trump, should be pushed aside.  That would allow America to be a great superpower again by enabling it to work collectively and closely with citizens in other blocks to build and to forge links, rather than sowing the seeds of division, which, sadly, we have seen for the past four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#J00800","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his very important question.

I hope we will return to that approach.  Joe Biden is a former member of the United States Senate and is a member of its alumni association.  He is an institutionalist by nature.  American foreign policy since the end of the Second World War has largely been bipartisan, with minor exception.  America can return to that position in terms of meeting the world and embracing multilateral institutions, including the Paris Agreement.  I hope that we will be able to return to the Iran agreement and the World Health Organization.  The President-elect has signalled that he intends to do precisely that.

My staff will confirm that I received more ugly mail over that defence than any other event I have undertaken in my time in public life, which now spans more than four and a half decades.  The Senator has reminded me that, sometimes, it is important to take those big risks.  I urged Bill Clinton to do it and he did it.

There is the argument that all sides, Leave and Remain, offered to the people of the UK.

For someone who was born and lives in a Border county, we more than most are grateful and appreciate every day the change it has brought to our lives and communities.

How will the world, and Ireland, see a change in outlook compared with the previous Administration?  An issue close to all members and to the Congressman is that of the undocumented Irish in America.  Does he see any developments for all those undocumented who, as we go into Christmas week next week, are thinking of loved ones in Ireland that they cannot visit and would like to be in a position to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#L00200","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1608076800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>That is a terrific question.  It is also a foreign policy question.  The undocumented Irish live in the shadows, as I reminded people when I received an honorary degree at Ulster University not long ago.  It is important to understand that there are Irish immigrants who live in America who can never return home for a funeral, first communion or wedding because if they are undocumented they take the risk of not being able to get back into the country.  I will give a vivid example, because anecdotes can be powerful, particularly when they are accurate.  I was in Holyoke, Massachusetts, part of my constituency that had a large population from Mayo.  Springfield had Kerrymen and Holyoke, which is just ten miles away, had a huge population from Mayo, Bellmullet in particular.  A woman asked me if she could have a word.  I said, \"Sure, go ahead\" and she said, \"Outside\".  We walked outside and she told me her father was dying and that she would like to go back for the funeral but the risk was that she would not be able to get back into the country.  That is the cruelty of what has happened.  We were unable to secure passage for her.  Zooming a funeral does not make it.  We have a challenge in America over the issue of the undocumented, which some estimate is as high as 11 million people.  Here is another corresponding part of the argument.  It is important to remember that we need them in America.  This is a technical economic issue, but this is what the Ways and Means Committee does, because we do economics.  The population was announced today by our census bureau at about 332 million Americans, and our birthrate is at about 1.9 per family which is not keeping pace.  In order to support many of our social initiatives, including social security and Medicare, we need these people to continue to contribute and they should be able to do so in the light of day, not in the dark of the shadows.  Think of it this way.  One of the most enduring and successful initiatives in American history has been social security.  When someone turns 62 to 69 years, they join this great entitlement based on their years of work.  Another part of the cruelty is that many of these individuals in America use false social security cards.  They contribute to the social security system but will never be able to derive the benefit under current circumstances.  They do their part.  I have had many memorable moments and listened to a lot of great speeches.  I like to give a few myself, but I recall one by the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, at a St. Patrick's Day gathering in the Rayburn Room with President Trump, Speaker Pelosi and myself.  We were all trying to figure out how the Taoiseach would handle it.  He spoke from the heart about the undocumented Irish in America and normalising their capacity.  His speech ended with a magnificent line; he said the millions of Irish who sought refuge in America wanted to make America great, too.  It brought a thunderous ovation from those of us who understand that right of passage and how difficult it was.  When my family left, they never went back.  They never went back for funerals, weddings or wakes and I like to think that is one of the reasons they were so devoted to the printed word, because the letters are extraordinary as they described their situations.  They then read the letters of parents they would never see again when they left at 18 or 19 years.  I hope and expect that this will be one of the first issues President Biden will take up, but I appreciate the question because there are many of them in my constituency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2020121600002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Neal"},{"type":"speech","time":1608076800,"counter":1080,"content":"<p>I think we all share the hope that is an issue that can be addressed in the coming term.

As a Donegal man who lives north of the North, in a county that is completely cut off by the Border in good times and bad, I am acutely aware of many issues which were addressed in the work of Mr. Neal and his colleagues, through President Clinton's administration, and the good work done by Senator Mitchell during the talks that led up to the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>As a member of the all-party Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, that is the angle I am coming from in my remarks.  Although a significant amount of good work has been done with regard to the Good Friday Agreement, there is still a lot of key work needed to ensure it is brought to completion.  In saying that, I am referring to the communities on both sides of the Border, to which the Congressman referred earlier, that do not pull together and do not recognise each other's identities or respect what each other stands for.  The Government, under the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, has set up an all-island unit which has taken on a significant amount of work and is trying to start a dialogue to see where the differences are and try to gain traction and respect.<\/p><p> There has been much talk about a united Ireland and all present would love to see it come about, but it is not as simple as having a border poll.  One could hold a border poll tomorrow morning and it may be determined by a margin of 1%, but it would have the potential to undo the Good Friday Agreement if the groundwork is not done beforehand.<\/p><p> The Congressman has done great work for Ireland and we really appreciate everything he has done, but there is still a key piece of work on which we will need his help.  It will be a little bit similar to the work done on the Good Friday Agreement.  We need to reach a point at which we have an honest broker in the room again to break down the barriers that exist and create respect.  We need to respect identities and differences of opinion and religion.  We need to learn to share this island as one.  Until we do that, we will not be able to move forward.  There is a significant amount of groundwork to be done.

In an RT&Eacute; interview I pointed out that while travelling from Donegal to Derry with Tom Foley, the then Speaker of the House, whose family came from Ireland through Boston on their way to the west coast of America, our bus was stopped and searched by British soldiers with night vision gear and heavy armaments.  They went up and down the bus.  On a later visit with Speaker Pelosi, my phone pinged when I crossed the Border.  That is the example the Senator has highlighted.  He is onto a very important and prescient point, namely, that we must convince people in the unionist tradition in the North that their identity will always be protected, including in any decision that would be rendered by people across the island as it relates to the future.  A significant amount of remarkable work has already taken place.  I think the goodwill that has been exhibited by Members of the Senate is convincing unionists through a reasoned discussion that their tradition and history will be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee should know that we tried very hard to do that.  I know that unionists were probably suspicious of my intentions when I came to Ireland as part of the delegation and met with them, but I pointed out that Thomas Jefferson, the founder of my political party, was at least a nominal Episcopalian, while Andrew Jackson, who perhaps cemented the tradition of the Democratic Party in America, was another individual who did not share my religious background.  In time, a growing economy can convince people that the concept of unity without uniformity, which we embrace in America, can triumph.  I was very careful through the years to point out that we would never be able to cajole the unionist tradition through a harsh campaign of violence.  That would not work.<\/p> <p>  Now, there is a new day.  I refer to the Irish economy, the resilience of people in the Republic and what the State has done in the aftermath of the very difficult years that followed the banking crisis that affected the world.

I remember the Good Friday Agreement being discussed in my school when I was a young girl of 16 years of age.  I never thought it could come about.  As I sat in that classroom, I thought there was no way they were going to agree.  With the oversight and help of America and Europe, agreement was reached and diplomacy won out.  It was a great day.  It changed my life and it saved the lives of countless people.  We will never know how many lives it has saved.<\/p> <p>  It has not always been the case that Ireland stood with America and Europe on its shoulders or behind it.  If one goes back 100 years ago, before this State was even created, Irish representatives went to Paris and asked Woodrow Wilson for a meeting because they wanted Ireland to be recognised.  They did not get a meeting.  Look at what we, as a country, have done through 100 years of diplomacy and the good relationships we have built up.  We now have Europe and America standing tall for us.  That is helping us with Brexit negotiations and has helped through all the difficulties we have had in the past couple of years.  Much of it is down to proud Irish-Americans standing tall and helping us out.  I thank the Congressman in that regard.<\/p> <p>  To come back to the remarks of Senator Blaney, as a Border person, there is an imaginary line.  Some people think it is sort of theoretical or academic but this is about our lives and communities.  We do not see a Border.

It is just reality to us.<\/p> <p>  My one ask of the Congressman is to support us to ensure that we have a shared island and that we honour our flag - the green, the orange and the peace between them.

I think the reinforcement and confidence that Ireland has given us and that we have given it have been really important.  People such as the Senator who live in Border communities know first-hand what the situation was like.  I made that point to the Brexiteers.  Senators are aware who they were and who they are.  I asked them whether they remembered what the Border was like 30 years ago.  They gave at least a grudging acknowledgement that they recalled what it was really like.

There is a lot of clutter to democracy.  One of the things we cherish is the Bill of Rights and the cornerstone of that is free speech.  That means we guarantee a second opinion in the first amendment.  The conflict we have all witnessed in America, which has also been embraced by parts of Europe and other parts of the world, is also a reflection of the amplification of conflict through social media.  We live in a time of people choosing the media forums that agree with them rather than the opposite and objectivity is becoming a bit more of a challenge.  Journalism has increasingly chosen a side as well and it has made our lives a good deal more difficult.  Those of us who embrace the institutions understand that the challenges we have now do not come close to America's Civil War.  They do not come close to us staring down fascism and Nazism and aggressive military escapades from other parts of the world.  I still believe in the lamp Jefferson lit and the Declaration of Independence.  While he was not consistent in his own endeavours that related to it, it challenged men and women across the world to embrace the principle of the sturdiness of the individual.<\/p> <p>  I am sitting maybe 50 ft from where Abraham Lincoln sat in 1865 after the American Civil War, in which he stared down the forces of slavery and rejected the idea that the south could ever leave the union.  After 2% of the American people had been killed during that war, he said, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all\", and welcomed people back to the union.  The divisiveness we are all witnessing will be overcome by my faith and our faith in the institutions of American life.  The populism that is swelling across the world is, in the end, not well met by the argument that such people have easy answers.  Those of us who live in democratic nations know that if the solutions were easy, we would have done them.  Our support for our institutions should not be abridged.  We should defend them as assertively as we can.  I am delighted that Senator Fitzpatrick had such a great experience here and that her relatives can sing the national anthem.
