If there are outstanding matters, I ask that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, refer back to me.  I understand she is not available today.<\/p> <p>I wish to speak about an organisation called Green Sod Ireland.  It is an amazing organisation which does its work voluntarily.  Like many environmental organisations, it is scraping around in search of funding to keep itself going.  One of the key issues this organisation and many others have is multi-annual core funding.  Green Sod Ireland is disappointed that it has not been successful when it has applied previously to the scheme to support national organisations.  I am told it has not been successful because of the criteria, which are addressing poverty and social exclusion and promoting equality.  I believe much of the work the organisation does could qualify under these criteria.  Apart from that, however, it is quite disappointing to see environmental organisations, which put so much into their local communities, being turned down for this type of funding.  I ask that the Minister consider broadening the criteria if she does not feel they match.<\/p> <p>I will give an outline of the organisation's work.  It has over 100 acres at present.  It has had to turn down donations of more acres.  Its members are stewards and custodians of that land, ensuring that it is rewilded and that habitats are brought back to their natural state.  It varies from place to place.  The organisation has tracts of land in Ballinrobe in Mayo, in Connemara, Galway, Cavan and Donegal.  It has areas all over the country and part of its function is to provide support for ecologists to do a report and then to maintain the land.  Its members also visit schools and promote biodiversity.  They work with communities to bring these tracts of land back to life.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State can understand, it is very much about equality of access to our wild spaces and equality in the broadest sense of equality for all species.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State and to hearing about what other schemes the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, could provide in this respect.  While I am aware that there are other schemes, I believe the organisation also has not received funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was a great disappointment.  Doors are being closed to it all the time.  However, this scheme applies more generally and I am sure I am not alone in having organisations coming to me to seek multi-annual funding.  It is time we stepped up because applying for a grant only gives funding for a small project, which means the organisation cannot retain a member of staff or plan for the long term.  It is also a major burden to make grant applications year after year, and perhaps several in one year, to sustain the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#C00500","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue with regard to environmental organisations working in the community, including Green Sod Ireland.

In keeping with Green Sod Ireland&rsquo;s purpose to protect and conserve Irish land in perpetuity, for the sake of its indigenous inhabitants, cleaner air, warmer homes, less traffic congestion, a healthier population and greater biodiversity are among the many benefits Ireland will enjoy as a result of taking action.

To this end, Pobal and the Minister launched strand 2 of the community climate action programme, which focuses on climate education, capacity building and learning by doing.  An overall budget for strand 2 is set at &euro;5 million.  Its aim is to build capacity and know-how of communities, enabling and empowering them to become low-carbon in an inclusive and collaborative manner.  It is envisaged the strand will fund a mix of different types of projects that focus on providing climate education rather than awareness, and this will lead to tangible climate action within communities.  The funding will facilitate eligible organisations to develop supports, tools, approaches and know-how with local communities to tackle climate change.  The key point to note in that regard is that it will facilitate eligible organisations.<\/p><p>In keeping with the citizen engagement theme in Climate Action Plan 2021, the Department of Rural and Community Development has committed to complete a public participation networks, PPNs, structural review, with a focus on ensuring PPNs are fit for purpose for climate action as per the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.  In addition, the Department will facilitate consultation with communities on climate policy through the public participation networks in collaboration with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Under the Climate Action Plan 2021, the Department of Rural and Community Development is also working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to develop and include a module on climate change in the guidelines for the development of new local economic and community plans.<\/p><p>The mission of the Department of Rural and Community Development is to promote rural and community development and support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities.  Funding is available under the rural regeneration and development fund to support job creation in rural areas, address depopulation of rural communities and support improvements in towns and villages with a population of fewer than 10,000 persons, as well as outlying areas.  Initial funding of &euro;315 million has been allocated to the fund on a phased basis for the period 2019-22.  Category 1 applications for the fund are now open for submissions.

I am aware the issue is important to her, her colleagues and the Department.  However, it is also an issue that is important to the Government, because it commits in the programme for Government to addressing this in its lifetime.<\/p> <p>Instead of having our current system for people who wish to donate their organs when they pass away, whereby they must sign a donor card that allows for donation if something happens to them, I recommend what is done in Spain, where one has to opt out of donation.  This is important for several reasons.  One reason our current system fails is that the organs of those with organ donor cards may not be donated after their death if they have not had a conversation about donation with their next of kin.  It happens quite often that the next of kin are uncomfortable with organ donation.  Even when someone with an organ donor card tragically passes away, the next of kin still have to be asked if they are okay with donating his or her organs.  Often this happens in very tragic circumstances.  There are many things the next of kin have to worry about in addition to organ donation.  Obviously, the decision has to be made extremely quickly.  The next of kin may not be comfortable with donation and, most important, the conversation between a potential donor and his or her partner or next of kin may not have happened.  If we introduce an opt-out system, it will be the choice of the next of kin not to have the organs of the deceased donated if they have a strong view on it.  In Spain, about 14% of the population over 18 have opted out of donation.<\/p> <p>It is obvious what an opt-out system does: it gives more opportunities to those who need an organ donation.  In Ireland, about 650 people need an organ donation.  I believe 270 organ donors died last year, affording an opportunity to donate, but only 190 transplants actually happened as a consequence.  Of these, 123 were kidney transplants, 37 were liver transplants and 16 were lung transplants.  Nine patients received a heart transplant.  Some 650 people need an organ transplant but we have 190 transplants per year.  That means 450 people are still waiting and going through very traumatic times, be it on dialysis or otherwise.  Many of these are young kids.  We do not want people waiting longer than necessary to receive a donation, be it of a kidney, lung or heart. <\/p> <p>From my experience, many are willing to be organ donors but have not applied.  They all have busy lives and may not have had the conversation.  If there were an opt-out system, they would be happy with it.  There would be no need to do anything.  This is about caring for and protecting people and making it as easy as possible for those in very difficult circumstances and who need a donation to receive one as quickly as possible.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#E00300","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I wish everyone a happy St. Brigid's Day, L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de.

We can all look forward to that.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and for the opportunity to speak on it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.  I am very glad to get the opportunity to speak on this subject because I am a very strong advocate for organ donation.  I remember as a teenager signing up to that particular card.  The reason I did it was we lost a young girl in Portlaw many years ago and it was the first time I had heard of organ donation.  At the time, when we heard her organs were being donated, it struck me how important it was.  One person dying is a tragedy, but the gift of life could be given to so many other families.  By coincidence, the girl's brother has been a Member of this House.<\/p> <p>It is such an important thing and it is the most selfless act that we can bestow on each other.  The improvement in the quality of life for organ recipients and their families cannot be overstated.  We have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from organ donation.  In that context, the Government allocated an additional &euro;1 million in funding in 2022 to continue to improve organ donation and transplantation services in the State.  This funding will support the ongoing development of transplant services, enhance our ability to access organ donors from abroad, and improve organ donation staffing and infrastructure.  This funding will also ensure that our organ donation and transplantation services are equipped to meet the additional demands arising following the enactment of the human tissue Bill.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government includes a commitment to \"Enact the Human Tissue Bill, providing the legal basis for an opt-out system of organ donation and deliver a public information campaign.\"  Reference was made to Spain, and I was struck by the fact that 14% of people in Spain have opted out.  This means that 86% of people are included, which is a phenomenal figure.  The aim with the Bill is to make organ donation the norm in Ireland in situations where the opportunity arises.<\/p> <p>Under the soft opt-out system, consent for organ donation will be deemed unless the person has, while alive, registered their wish not to become an organ donor after death.  It is proposed, however, that even though consent is deemed, the next-of-kin will always be consulted prior to removing any organ.  If the next-of-kin objects to the organ donation, the donation will not proceed.  The best way for a person to ensure that their wish to become an organ donor is realised is to have that conversation with their family, discuss their intention around organ donation and make their wishes clearly known to family members.<\/p> <p>The proposed opt-out register for organ donation will create a clear and easily communicable choice to individuals to either opt-out of deceased organ donation entirely, or to allow deemed consent to apply.  Signing up to the opt-out register will be a definitive expression of the person&rsquo;s wish to not become an organ donor after death.  An opt-out register will make organ donation the clear default option, and signal to citizens the move towards organ donation being the norm.<\/p> <p>The enactment of the human tissue Bill is a priority for the Government.  The Department of Health continues to engage closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to progress the drafting of the Bill with the objective of bringing a memorandum to Government to secure approval to publish the Bill as soon as possible in the 2022 spring legislative session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#F00100","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response and her support.

One organ donor can save eight lines.  It is phenomenal.<\/p> <p>She give an example of the case in her own county.

In addition, classes that had been running at half capacity due to Covid-19 distancing measures are now back at full intake of 14 to 16 apprentices per phase.<\/p><p>An amount of &euro;20 million in capital funding was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade craft apprenticeship facilities across the further and higher education institutions.  Some &euro;17 million of additional funding was provided under budget 2022 to facilitate the response to the backlogs across SOLAS and the higher education sector.  This included a significant recruitment campaign to increase the number of trainers.  The delivery structures for phase 2 off-the-job training have been changed to facilitate a third intake of apprentices per annum and an opt-in rapid employer assessment is being piloted for the final phase of craft apprenticeships.<\/p><p>At the end of December, 8,797 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phases 2, 4 and 6 off-the-job training.  This is down from the 12,000 apprentices that were on the list last August.  Subject to continuing access to workshops and training facilities, and in addition to the roll-out of more places, it is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training at phases 4 and 6 will be called in the early months of this year.  It is expected that the phase 2 waiting list will be completely cleared by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#G00600","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive answer.

Hundreds of nationalists and Catholics were killed as a result of collusion by the British Government's armed forces and loyalist paramilitary groups.  Thousands of confidential files were handed over to loyalists by various intelligence agencies, all of the British Government.  Directly and through loyalist proxies, the British Government could be responsible for approximately one third of all deaths in the conflict.  <br\/><br\/>The Operation Greenwich report deals with the British Government's armed forces colluding with loyalists to kill 19 people, including Councillor Eddie Fullerton, a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor in Donegal, and Councillor Bernard O'Hagan, a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor in south Derry.  This report follows other official reports into collusion, including: the Oireachtas report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which was described as state-sponsored terrorism; Stalker and Sampson investigations; the three inquiries carried out by Lord Stevens, the former commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Service; Justice Cory's report; and the de Silva report.  <br\/><br\/>Former British Prime Minister, David Cameron, apologised to the family of the murdered human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane, for collusion in his murder.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will know that this House recently unanimously passed a motion calling for a full public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  Relatives organisations, such as Relatives for Justice and the Pat Finucane Centre, published reports on the collusion, including Collusion 1990-1994: Loyalist Paramilitary Murders in Northern Ireland and the book <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland <\/i>by Anne Cadwallader.  <br\/><br\/>All of these reports demonstrate clearly that there is an irrefutable paper trail of collusion leading to the front door of 10 Downing Street.  What is the British Government's response to this overwhelming evidence?  A proposed amnesty - a pardon, if you will - for all those involved in collusion.  The Irish Government must ensure that this does not happen by supporting actions by relatives of those killed through collusion, by supporting the Stormont House Agreement and by lobbying governments and human rights organisations across the world.  The British Government should abandon its amnesty plan, stop running away from the truth and implement the all-party agreed Stormont House legacy agreement, which is an independent process, is human rights compliant and can deliver what the families seek.  That is the truth.<br\/><br\/>I would like to finish on this before the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, addresses the House.  Next week marks the 30th anniversary of the awful massacre at the Sean Graham bookmakers' shop on the Ormeau Road.  I raised that incident in this House last year.  Families will gather, as they always do, to recite a rosary and lay flowers at the bookmakers' shop.  Those families are expecting a further report from the police ombudsman which I have no doubt in its breadth and depth will go even further in highlighting the stark level of murderous collusion that existed between loyalist paramilitary gunmen and the British Government.  <br\/><br\/>It is important that the community in the North hear responses from the Irish Government.  As I said in my opening remarks, it is crucial that the Irish Government's voice on this issue continues to be heard on the international stage.  I note and commend the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on this up until now.  This is where we are at.  It seems now one cannot go a week without another ombudsman's report or another case in the Belfast High Court, where families are, unfortunately, being forced to take the British Government to court because of the lack of truth and justice.  This is having a traumatic impact.  People are looking to the Irish Government to lead and to take actions.  I look forward to hearing the Minister outlining what actions he proposes to take regarding the Operation Greenwich report. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#H00600","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm bheith anseo inniu ar son an Rialtais chun an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo a fhreagairt.

The report, as the Deputy well knows, has identified collusive behaviours and raised significant concerns about police conduct during this time.  Ms Anderson held that the concerns on the part of the families of those killed regarding collusive activity were legitimate and justified.  A range of factors included intelligence and surveillance failings, the failure to warn people about threats to their lives, the passing of information by members of the security forces to paramilitaries, the deliberate destruction of files related to informants and the passive turning a blind eye to apparent criminal activity.  <\/p> <p>It is undoubtedly a significant report and the Government will study its findings carefully.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is of course a deeply impactful moment for those families whose loved ones were killed in these acts of violence.  Our thoughts must be first and foremost with those families as they read and process the findings.<\/p><p>The report, however, serves to highlight the vital work of the office of the Police Ombudsman as an independent system for the handling of complaints about the conduct of police officers.  This is a work of great sensitivity and importance that is essential in order for society to have confidence in policing and the rule of law into the future.  Those families who are impacted by the report and every family who lost somebody in the Troubles deserve to know the truth about what happened to their loved one, to have access to effective investigations and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.<\/p><p>Addressing the legacy of the conflict on the island is a complex and sensitive task, but in 2014 the two Governments and the parties reached an agreement that mapped out a fair and balanced framework designed to do so, which would see the establishment of a historic investigations unit, an independent commission for information recovery and an oral history archive.  The Stormont House Agreement was based on the fundamental principles of facilitating the pursuit of justice, upholding the rule of law, meeting the legitimate needs of victims and survivors, and fulfilling our shared human rights obligations.  We have been working for the implementation of that agreement for families who need to see a system in place and a clear road they can take to access truth and justice.  Progress is essential and too much time has passed.<\/p><p>The UK Government, as the Senator knows, has put forward proposals, including a statute of limitations, that constitute a significant departure from that agreement into which it entered.  We have made it clear this is not something we can support.  We are totally opposed to it.  The proposals have faced strong and almost universal opposition from victims, civil society and every political party.  We have cautioned the British Government strongly against any unilateral action in this space.

The Acting Leader has campaigned strongly for its recognition and we will not be here in the Chamber this day next year.  Today also marks the centenary of the day in 1922 when the then Irish Free State took responsibility for Irish education.  I am grateful to Emeritus Professor A&iacute;ne Hyland of University College Cork who pointed out that the task set for Irish education was as follows: \"In the administration of Irish education, it is the intention of the new government to work with all its might for the strengthening of the national fibre by giving the language, history, music and tradition of Ireland, their natural place in the life of Irish schools.\"  While there have often been calls for reform in our education system, this is the centenary of a system which has, broadly, served us well.  It is appropriate that this House thanks educators and all those involved over the last century who have succeeded in bringing our education system to where it is today.<\/p><p>This brings me to an issue that I have raised regularly.  I refer to the proposal by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to cut the third-level registration charge aspect of student fees.  This is welcome.  It can only be done, however, in a context where there will not be a great loss of income for the higher education institutions.  Therefore, I call again for a debate on higher education funding.  It is nearly six years since the Cassells report was published and such a debate is long overdue.<\/p><p>Everybody here welcomes the return of Richard O&rsquo;Halloran.  It was a disgrace that he was detained against his will in China for three years.  We have had a debate on China, but our relationship with that country needs to be explored further.  It is completely wrong that an Irish citizen should be detained for such a long time.  I wish Richard O&rsquo;Halloran and his family a very happy future, as will everybody else in the House.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise a matter that I addressed during a Commencement matter debate several weeks ago and that I have spoken about on other occasions as well.  I refer to a competition mandate for the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is welcome and positive that Revolut has today announced that it will be making loans and other services available to Irish consumers.  The company, however, is also moving its operations from Ireland to Lithuania.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s lack of a competition mandate is one of the major problems that we have with that institution.  It must stop simply protecting the pillar banks and start to encourage financial technology and financial services industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#N00700","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I also commend the Acting Leader on her first day taking the Order of Business.

I have known Aimee since she was a child.  Like everybody else, I was totally unaware of what she was going through and the horrendous experience she was suffering regularly.  She waived her right to anonymity and spoke openly about the value of victim impact statements, what they do for victims and the power they give to victims.<\/p> <p>She also spoke, however, about sentencing and how horrendously disappointed and outraged she was with the sentence in this case.

Some 25% of them did not get a junior certificate to start with.  They have been out of school for a large chunk of fifth year and a significant chunk of this year.  There are medically vulnerable young people who have still not gone back to school and have missed even more time.  Whatever way it is dressed up or down, an exam is an exam.  No matter how many choices there are in an exam, it has to be done within a two or three-hour period.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Foley, to re-examine this.  The right thing to do is to give young people doing their leaving certificate this year the same option students had last year and the year before.

It is a remarkable fact that whereas it is an offence knowingly to provide false information if, for example, someone is applying for nursing home support or dealing with the Revenue Commissioners or a social protection matter, it is not an offence to do so in the context of making an application to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, or knowingly to supply false information, whether one is acting as the respondent or otherwise, in one's dealing with PIAB.  That is a real lacuna and one which ought to be addressed.  My short Bill proposes to address that and I would be very grateful to colleagues if, between now and when the Bill is taken, they examine and consider supporting it.  As we all know, it is difficult to quantify how much fraud actually takes place in the context of bringing personal injuries actions.  When we consider that 70% of the work of PIAB has to do with motor insurance, it is obvious that anything we can do to combat fraud should be done, starting with deterring it by establishing that it is an offence knowingly to provide false information to PIAB.  It is to be hoped that will eventually deter fraud and lead to lower insurance premiums, which is one of the key places we want to go.

It is an important and special day.  This was a real living, breathing woman of faith who has had a major influence on Irish life.  Looking at the various St. Brigid's crosses here today, I am sorry when I was in Ballinasloe church over the weekend, where Ballinasloe social services was selling St. Brigid's crosses as a fundraiser, that I did not bring one for everybody in the Seanad.  It was a lack of presence of mind on my part.  It is an important day and one I hope many people will reflect on even more into the future.<\/p> <p>I second and commend what Senator Malcolm Byrne said about the eventual and tardy release of Richard O'Halloran.  It is a disgrace that any country in the modern day would hold a person hostage in this way, which is, in effect, what happened.  We are now at the beginning of the Winter Olympics in Beijing.  They should not be taking place in Beijing, any more that there should not have been an Olympic in Nazi Germany in 1936.  The horrors of what the Chinese regime is perpetrating is something that must continue to attract our attention and censure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#P00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Gu&iacute;m L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de sona ar gach duine anseo.

It came up during the week in the newspapers.  I thank Cathy Halloran for the piece she did.  It is something I worked on in my previous job.  There are ten times more boys than girls cycling to school in Ireland.  This is not based on physiology or any challenge faced.  Even though it seems like a small thing it is massive.  We really need to look at it.  Why do ten times more boys than girls cycle to school?  Are they ten times as good at cycling?  Absolutely 100% not.  It says a lot about society that teenage girls do not feel like cycling compared with teenage boys.  There are many reasons for it including social issues.<\/p><p>A big issue I will mention briefly is that many girls schools still have mandatory skirts.  Girls in 2022 are not allowed to wear trousers.  It is an absolute disgrace.  I will do a national call.  I hope to do something whereby all of the female politicians will stand up and demand that every girl in 2022 has the right to go to school with a pair of pants on.  It is a very basic thing.  It is embarrassing that we have to ask for it in this day and age.  We have a female Minister for Education.  I really hope we can work together on this.  It is embarrassing for me as an aunt to young girls and as someone who knows women and girls in their teenage years and in their 20s.  I am embarrassed we still have many schools throughout Ireland that do not allow the girls to wear pants.  It influences how they cycle.<\/p><p>This brings me to my next point.  Next week we will celebrate Science Week.  I will be encouraging women in science because I did maths and physics myself.  We do not even have girls cycling bikes.  We do not have them wearing pants.  We have a long way to go.  This is a very basic ask and we need to work on it.  I am sure everybody here will support me on this.  It is embarrassing in 2022.  It is our legacy.  We are the middle-aged people now.  We are the older people.  We owe it to the younger generations to break it.  My mother was not allowed wear pants until she was 18 but that was 70 years ago.  We are saying the same to young girls now.  With this comes the fact that girls can move around and be independent.<\/p><p>In this day and age even though we are finally celebrating a female saint, women are still the primary carers.  They are the ones left on the school run.  They are left trying to do the cycle bus, the walking bus and the get-them-out-the-door bus.  To this end we see that infrastructure does not support them.  We really lack active travel and proper infrastructure.  Red paint on the side of the road is not enough.  We know the Department has given all of the funding needed for local authorities.  On this day as a feminist, a woman, a mother and a carer who wants better for the next generation I ask the local authorities to take this seriously.  It is a gender-based issue.  We need the confidence to use infrastructure.  The local authorities have the money.  They need to up their game.  I wish everyone the best of luck for L&aacute; Fh&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Foley, will take seriously my demand for the basic right to wear trousers to school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#P00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Cos&uacute;il le mo chomhghleacaithe, gu&iacute;m beannachta&iacute; na f&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de ar achan duine.

While we often hear the Government talk about the role on the UN Security Council and the important place that this State has in the EU, it is really important that we hear from the Government what actions that it will take in response to the report and, indeed, in response to the proud Irish tradition of standing actively in opposition to apartheid in South Africa, and what we are going to stand against when it manifests itself against the Palestinian people.

We recently learned, following a very successful campaign by so many in this House and, indeed, the Lower House, that we will celebrate a public holiday from next year.  It is, therefore, timely to send out an invitation to one and all to come to County Kildare next year for the first ever public holiday of 2023.

If the Bill is successful the legislation will be renamed the child trafficking and child sexual exploitation material Act 1998 and the child trafficking and child exploitation material (amendment) Act 2004.  Any reference to child pornography in legislation will be replaced with the term \"child sexual exploitation\".  It is not only important, but necessary.  The issue is that the language currently being used has been found to be harmful.<\/p><p>With regard to child abuse, child trafficking and child sexual exploitation material, the Luxembourg Guidelines provide a comprehensive and detailed breakdown of the importance of language.  According to a report conducted with the aid of a number of international bodies, including the UN, the term \"child pornography\" is not only incorrect, but dangerous.  Why is that?  One hears the term \"child pornography\" and understands what it means.  Why is it dangerous when our laws already provide for measures against it?  The reason is that what is happening in these awful incidents is not pornography.  It is abuse.  In the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act legislators were careful not to employ the term \"revenge pornography\".  While that term is widely used and understood, the term \"image-based sexual assault\" not only better reflects the nature of the abuse and the crime but also shifts the focus to the perpetrator, not the victim.  I wish to do the same.  Language is important and powerful.  What we say spreads throughout our community, country and globally.  Language shapes and defines our understanding.  It is not pornography; it is abuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#R00500","speaker":"1657","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Senator on the introduction of her Bill.

It is very frustrating and stressful for people.  Last week we had the publication of the second quarterly report on Housing for All, the Government's &euro;20 billion plan to deliver more than 330,000 affordable, social and private homes both to purchase and rent over the next decade.  It is a massively important plan.  Despite Covid-19 last year, the shutdown of construction and the fact that we are emerging from a decade of undersupply, there is good news from the second quarterly report and there is hope for people who are genuinely struggling at present to either buy or rent their own home.  Of the 231 actions in the plan, 123 have commenced or have been completed.  It is important to recognise that last year, despite the shutdown, more than 20,000 homes were completed.  There were more than 39,000 planning applications and more than 30,000 commencements.  That all helps on the supply side.<\/p> <p>On the affordability side, this House and the D&aacute;il passed the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which is significant and game-changing legislation to address affordability.  There is real hope there and it is very important that Members of both Houses use the legislation we have passed and use all the resources available to the State to deliver increased housing supply and affordability.  Some people are engaging in a vile level of hypocrisy on this subject.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I urge them to stop doing so and to be constructive.

I had called for a hybrid leaving certificate.  I have been contacted by many students, not just from Limerick, but from across the country.  I am really disappointed with the proposal brought forward by the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Last Monday, I was in a DEIS school where not only every student sitting the leaving certificate but every teacher in the school as well believes the right thing to happen is to have a balanced leaving certificate.  Many of the students who will sit the leaving certificate this year did not even sit the junior certificate.  They have been badly affected by Covid.  It would have been great to reintroduce the leaving certificate.  Obviously, all present realise it needs to be amended but I do not believe this is the right year in which to bring back the full leaving certificate.<\/p> <p>The second issue is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la decided today to defer its determination in respect of the road from Limerick to Foynes, which would include a bypass of Adare.  Limerick and Ireland are hoping to host the Ryder Cup in Adare in 2027.  It will be one of the biggest tourism events in the country.  The more often this decision is put off, the more likely it is that the road will not be built in time for the Ryder Cup to be held.  I strongly believe the Government needs to put pressure on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to deliver or to make a decision in respect of this project because it is so pertinent not only to the mid-west but to all of Ireland.  There is no point in hosting an event of this size if the roads are going to be congested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#T00200","speaker":"1695"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I wish a happy St. Brigid's Day to the Acting Leader and all her friends in Kildare.

I do not think anyone can accept plaudits for taking three years to get a person out of China.  It is outrageous that it took that long.

What happened was outrageous, in my view.  <\/p> <p>My colleague, Senator Wall, referred to Cathal Brugha Barracks.  I cannot for the life of me understand how any Minister would walk out and put a video up online announcing that the Government is closing Cathal Brugha Barracks.

I support a truth and justice system, if we can get one in place, but I do not under any circumstances support the call by the British Prime Minister for an amnesty.  Those who are guilty of crimes must be brought to justice.  I looked at the Ballymurphy case in particular.  To me, that looked like a couple of thugs on top of a building using real live humans for target practice.  It is absolutely disgusting.  It is no secret that I served in the British Army, but I certainly have no time for and no truck with the individuals who were involved in either of those events.

It was great to see the five happy faces on Saturday.  Everywhere I went, including the most rural area in my constituency, people were saying it was a fantastic, happy day.  I wish the O'Halloran's well.  To see the picture of joy that was his children's faces was just something else.<\/p> <p>The O'Halloran case brings back into focus a case I have highlighted in this House on many occasions, which is that of Mr. Robert Pether, whose family lives in Elphin, County Roscommon.  He is an Australian citizen but his wife and children are Irish citizens.  His wife's family came from Dublin.  Her father, in his early days, went to Australia.  We now need to increase the pressure on the Iraqi authorities to release Mr. Pether from jail.  His family, no more than the O'Halloran's, is going through deep distress.  He is caught in quite a similar position to that in which Mr. O'Halloran was caught.  He is a top-class engineer who was in charge of the fantastic new central bank building in Iraq.  If people look it up, they will see it is an amazing building.   Apparently, there is an issue with over-expenditure of &euro;12 million.  Mr. Pether and his Iraqi colleague have been blamed in the battle between the Iraqi Government and the firm that employed them.  It is shocking and outrageous.  Mr. Pether and his colleague are in an Iraqi jail.  The Department is aware of it and has had some contact with the family.  I have been campaigning for a long time on this.  I ask everybody to do so.  The Acting Leader, Senator O'Loughlin, will agree with me and bring the message back to the Minister.  The Leader has been very helpful in this regard.

Outside, it is a fantastic spring day.  I acknowledge that spring is starting.<\/p> <p>There are two events I want to acknowledge.  The release of Mr. O'Halloran, particularly the work done by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department, needs to be acknowledged.  It has been a long battle.  Diplomacy was the key.  I am not referring to microphone diplomacy but to making sure we got the man home.  That was a really positive step.<\/p> <p>We also need to acknowledge that the announcement on the leaving certificate this afternoon is one that the many households will discuss at length in the next few days.  At home, I have a niece who is to do the leaving certificate this year.  Her view last Saturday was that she would be in favour of having the system.  The big issue is reform, however.  There needs to be reform.  The reform talked about for the past decade or two, because of how the leaving certificate operates and the pressure exerted on examination day, is the key issue.  We need a genuine review of what the leaving certificate will mean after Covid.  That involves taking the stress out of the process for students, guardians and parents.  This involves a significant body of work.  Unfortunately, very little has been done on it in the past 24 months.  The work needs to be done.  We need to move away from the system that has been in place since the mid-70s, which is such that if a student has a bad day on one examination day, it can affect his or her entire life.  That is not appropriate.

The idea of moving to a traditional leaving certificate during the year that could never be described as traditional, is just fundamentally unfair.  Last week I made the point that not only had the Ombudsman for Children called for a hybrid leaving certificate, it was hugely disappointing that the Minister for Education would ignore the advice of the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, through nobody's fault, there are significant sections of leaving certificate students who have not been able to cover the course.  This is the fundamental point.  They have not been able to cover the course, so how is it appropriate to stick with the traditional leaving certificate model?  All of us know the stress that students undergo with the leaving certificate.  I still wake up occasionally remembering the French exam back in 1983.  The stress of the past two years, however, has been so intense.  So many of our young people have had to undergo that stress in isolation.  Their usual social channels of meeting with colleagues and friends, which are so important when one is working towards the leaving certificate, and which give reassurance and knowledge and strengthen solidarity, have just not been there for so long.  People seem to forget that the leaving certificate is a two-year course and that most of last year was spent online.<\/p><p>I cannot understand this decision.  Fundamentally it lets down our students and parents, our friends and their families.  I would appeal to everyone to address this issue, to come back to the Minister for Education and call on her to revisit this urgently.  It is not fair and it is not just.  I am aware that the Department wants to keep a conservative line, and this is what civil servants often do, unfortunately.  Leadership would have been shown if the Minister had said, \"No, we need to stick with the hybrid model\".  This is a failure of leadership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#U00700","speaker":"1660","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I wish to discuss an issue that affects people across the board and across all local authorities.  I want to ask for a unified approach from government or a directive from the Department about how local authorities should approach this matter because it is different in every local authority.  I am referring to the way people are removed from the housing list.  I can only speak for my own area and what happens in County Louth in this regard.  It is deeply unfair, and I have felt that it has been deeply unfair ever since I first got elected to politics in 2014.<\/p> <p>Every year, local authorities need to make sure that they have accurate housing lists.  They write to people to ask them if they are interested in staying on the housing list.  If the person does not respond to that letter then he or she is instantly removed from the housing list, which is fair enough.  Currently, where an individual can come back to a local authority and say that he or she did not update the local authority about the list or about a new address, or that the person may not have received the letter or had moved address but now wants to stay on the housing list, the person is allowed back onto the housing list but loses all of the years he or she had previously been on the housing list.  It is deeply unfair that somebody could lose five, six, seven or eight years waiting for a council house because he or she had not replied back to one single letter.<\/p> <p>With all due respect to local authorities, they have absolutely no proof that such letters get to individuals in the first place.  It is very important that there is a unified approach or that some sort of a directive would come from the Department down to all local authorities to say how the standard should be dealt with across the board.  If people are four years on the list, for example, and then discover that they have been removed, they should be entitled to the four years that they had previously been on the list, and should be allowed to go back onto the list with the same time that they had.  This would be the fair thing to do.  I ask that we would engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage so that a directive is issued right across all local authorities, and that it is not a different process for people in Louth, Meath, Cavan or Monaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#V00200","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Happy St. Brigid's Day, and a happy lunar new year, which so many people around the world and in Ireland also celebrate.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the increase in the cost of a stamp.  Today we heard the news from An Post that it proposes, for the second time in a year, to increase the cost of postage nationally and internationally.  The cost of a stamp for a letter in Ireland will now go up to &euro;1.25.  I could understand if this was being done to stem the closure of post offices around the country.  Even in my own area, which is a suburban part of Dublin, we have had two post office closures recently at Woodbine Park, Booterstown, and in Dalkey.  These were two post offices that one would expect to be busy and functional post offices, but postmasters do not want to take over those offices because the pay and conditions are not sufficient to maintain them.  This is not why An Post is telling us it is increasing the cost of postage.  It is to meet the increasing costs of fuel and other things.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Barry Ward:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept that is happening for everybody in every industry.  However, few people have the privileged position or the market dominance that An Post has.  It is telling to look at An Post's accounts over recent years.  The most recent annual report from 2020, published last year, shows revenue and profits were up.  Profit was &euro;32.5 million in 2020.  Since then we have had a huge increase in the use of post and parcel services around the country, particularly during restrictions.  If An Post cannot make money during that time, it should ask why not.  It is certainly not channelling that money into provision for postmasters or into services.  It should recognise it operates a particular position in the Irish nation and economy to provide a service to the Irish people and it ill behoves it now, within a year of the last price increase, to seek to increase the price of a stamp again, thereby perhaps driving people away from its services, rather than encouraging them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#V00300","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>It is apt the Acting Leader is in the position she is in today on St. Brigid's Day.

I want to see a reduction in the volume of imported timbers in this country.  I want improvements to the forestry licensing scheme, which is currently causing a tremendous backlog and damaging and impacting on the potential for the industry.  A recent harvest licensing dashboard indicated the private sector, mainly farmers, received 26 felling licences, while Coillte received almost double that at around 51.  There is a debate and an argument between farmers and private forestry owners and Coillte concerning the proportionality in the administration of licensing.  That is a real issue.<\/p> <p>The Department has clearly failed in its targets for 2021, with only 4,500 licences.  I call for a debate specifically on licences, not on the bigger issue of forestry.  We have an enormous demand for forestry, both for harvesting and felling.  We need to address the issue.

The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is examining this issue at length, but it warrants debate in the House.  Why is it that a council like Waterford City and County Council accounts for 50% of all repair-and-lease units that have been delivered in the State?  It is having a positive impact in terms of delivering one- and two-bedroom units, predominantly in the city centre, which has reduced the need for bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation.  In fact, it has eradicated it.  That is a positive development in my county, but if it can be done in the fifth largest urban centre in the country, there is no reason it cannot be done elsewhere.<\/p> <p>I call for a debate on this matter.  It should not be the case that Waterford accounts for 50% of all repair-and-lease units.  While it is fantastic that we have so many, the scheme needs to be adopted more by other local authorities.  At last count, eight local authorities had not delivered a single unit and up to 20 had delivered five or fewer.  That is a dismal performance.

There is something that we and companies can do to improve the situation for people who have forgotten that their passports are out of date, namely, issue a reminder.  This month and next month, many people will be booking holidays abroad with Aer Lingus, Ryanair or travel agencies.  If those companies had a system whereby people were asked whether their passports are still six months in date and whether they could supply their passport reference numbers, people would have to look for their passports and check them, which would serve to remind them of whether their passports are in date.  We are always encountering situations where people have booked holidays or trips only to realise while packing their bags a week or a couple of days before they leave that their passports are out of date.  What if it was instead the case that someone could find out that his or her passport is out of date when booking a flight or a trip through a travel agency?  It would help the travel agencies, the airlines and the passport delivery service.  If people apply for passports earlier than they need them, they are more likely to be successful.

Senator Malcolm Byrne also spoke about &Aacute;ine Hyland's tweet, which I also noticed yesterday, on the fact that it is 100 years today since our education system was put in place.  The language, history, music and tradition that were mentioned 100 years ago are still hugely important today.  They are important for ourselves and they are important also for the new Irish who have come to live here so that they can appreciate our traditions and heritage.  <\/p><p>In regard to the issue of the Cassells report, I agree that it is regrettable that six years have gone by without any action in regard to that report.  Members may recall that the former Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton, suggested that the report go to the European Commission for economic evaluation.  My understanding is that it has been completed and has come back in the past month to the Government.  We certainly need a debate on that.  We have to invest in higher and further education going forward.  It is important, as Senators acknowledged, that students' costs go down.  We all support that but we must ensure there would not be a lacuna in regard to funding and support for higher and further education.  <\/p><p>The issue of Richard O'Halloran coming home was raised also.  Looking at the photographs of his children and his family over the weekend, the scenes testified to the unbridled joy in that family.  I cannot begin to imagine what the three years were like for them, and how happy they are to have their dad and husband back home.  We wish them all well.<\/p><p>Also mentioned was the competition mandate for the Central Bank, which is an interesting issue.  We could ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to come and have a debate in regard to that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Conway spoke about RT&Eacute;'s \"Claire Byrne Live\" programme last night.  I did not see it but he has prompted me to look at it.  It gave recognition to Aimee Foley who, very sadly, was abused by her dad and showed great bravery in regard to waiving anonymity.  He also spoke about the lack of adequate sentencing.  On the day that Ashling Murphy was buried, a man was in court for murdering a woman and he got 12 years for murder.  This was on the same day that the whole country was absolutely rocked with grief and shame that this happened to Ashling Murphy.  There is an issue about sentencing and we need to address this.  We all join in saluting Aimee for her courage and bravery in coming forward.<\/p><p>Senator Conway also spoke about the leaving certificate, as indeed did Senators Byrne, Carrigy and Gavan.  It is a very difficult decision to make.  Much consultation was put in place over the past few months.  The big issue that everybody called for over the past few weeks was clarity, and for a decision to be made.  A decision has been made.  I accept there is disappointment with the decision but now there is clarity and arrangements have been put in place to ensure that in mathematics for example - and this is from looking at the press release earlier - where there would normally be ten questions to be answered, six can be answered.  English comprehension will have the required number of response halved.  The fact that many of those doing their leaving certificate this year did not have the opportunity to do their junior certificate had to come into play.  That was an added difficulty in regard to a hybrid model.  We will take the message back.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of that there is no doubt.  It is a worrying and stressful time.  There is never going to be a leaving certificate without stress no matter what form it takes.  It is a preparation for further exams.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard made a particular comment on leaving certificate reform and I am surprised he asked the question about such reform because his own party colleague, Deputy Kehoe, is Chair of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and there have been 14 meetings in recent months on leaving certificate reform.  A total of 57 witnesses to date, between students, parent bodies, unions and teachers, have appeared before the committee on this issue.  I have no doubt there will be a very comprehensive report coming forward.  I agree we need to look at reform going forward.<\/p><p>I accept Senator Mullen&rsquo;s amendment and it has been seconded on the Order of Business.  I wish him well in the progress of his Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Bill 2022.  As the Senator said, it is hard to quantify insurance fraud and we certainly need to deter it, without a shadow of a doubt.<\/p><p>Senator Garvey mentioned that ten times more boys than girls cycle to school and that girls should be allowed to wear trousers in schools.  I completely agree.  In fact, there was a particular hearing of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills, as it was known under its last mandate, and there was a very clear direction that girls should be allowed wear trousers in school.  We need to support all of our young people to cycle and to support the cycling infrastructure throughout our towns and country. The point was well made.<\/p><p>Senator Garvey also made a point about science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects in schools.  I happened to see a small clip on television last night of Dr. Katriona O'Sullivan, who is a professor in Maynooth University, and she does tremendous work around equality in education.  It was a very interesting piece about working to support STEM within schools, particularly among girls in disadvantaged areas.  She is a wonderful woman and has made presentations before to the Oireachtas education committee and I would recommend following those.<\/p><p>Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile, Craughwell and Currie all spoke very passionately about Bloody Sunday and all of the coverage over the weekend.  My own father&rsquo;s anniversary was on Sunday.  In the midst of us going to mass and of our family meeting and our grief, I could not but be struck by the difference between what happened to our family and to the families on Bloody Sunday, together with the commemoration for Stardust victims.  As has been mentioned, the dignity of all the families who were interviewed, both in print and on television, was just incredible.  They deserve the truth and all of our support in all of the investigations that need to be done.  I certainly agree on the need to have truth and restorative justice and we will certainly bring those views forward to the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile also spoke about the report from Amnesty International on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  We all value the role of Amnesty International and we in Ireland have always been very forthright in expressing our solidarity with the Palestinian people.  We will look for a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this issue.<\/p><p>My county colleague, Senator Wall, has issued an invitation for everyone to come to Kildare, with which I completely agree.  St. Brigid was certainly looking down on Glen Ryan and all of the lads on Sunday.  The international and national recognition of Saint Brigid and the work undertaken in Kildare in lighting the Hill of Allen etc. was exemplary.  We look forward to greater things to come, especially in 2024.<\/p><p>Senator Wall also mentioned the Defence Forces, as did Senator Craughwell.  I completely agree on the comments about the video announcing a change of use for Cathal Brugha Barracks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I looked into that myself and I understand there was no basis for it whatsoever.  It was an appalling lack of respect for the military and defence community, those who serve in Cathal Brugha Barracks and all of the families.  Particularly in the year of Michael Collins's centenary, words fail me in terms of why the Minister did that.  The Senator also mentioned the commission report.  We look forward to having a lengthy debate.  It is so important that we invest in our Defence Forces and that we look at recruitment and retention.  We should thank the Defence Forces for all they have done, particularly during the pandemic.<\/p><p>I wish Senator Flynn the very best of luck with her first Private Members' Bill.  I worked with her on the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2020 that I had brought before the House.  I know her absolute commitment to this whole area.  I am very happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business which has been seconded now.  Sexual exploitation of anyone but especially children is absolutely horrific.  We all have to be committed to dealing with this in whatever way we can.<\/p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about the enormous challenge for those who are hoping to buy and those who are renting.  She spoke about the importance of hope to people who are locked out from owning their own home or indeed from renting a home.  We all need hope but we need practical actions as well.  She gave us good news that 123 of 231 actions have commenced or have taken place.  There were 20,000 houses completed and 30,000 commenced last year.  It is important to take the politics and the heat out of that debate and recognise it.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne also spoke about the leaving certificate issue and about the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision to defer a decision in respect of the Limerick to Foynes bypass.  I completely understand where she is at.  Delays on decisions like this do not help anyone.  We need to look for a decision on it.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about Richard O'Halloran and Cathal Brugha Barracks.  Senator Murphy spoke about Robert Pether from Elphin and his family; indeed I have often heard him speak about the matter before.  The fact that we see Richard O'Halloran thankfully being released means we really should be able to try to put all diplomatic efforts into bringing about the release of Robert and ensuring that his family has the same opportunity to reunite.<\/p><p>Senator Lombard spoke about the leaving certificate, which I have mentioned.  Senator Gavan spoke about the pagan aspect of Brigid.  He is 100% correct.  In many ways Brigid was the bridge between the pagan world and the world of Christianity.  Today is also the first day of Imbolc.  No matter who Brigid was, whether she was a saint or a pagan, it is an important day to recognise everything that she and maybe many different Brigids stood for.  The Senator also raised the issue of the leaving certificate.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon spoke about the housing list and how people who did not update cannot go back on in the same position.  He is correct.  That is the way it is happening in Kildare and I assume it is happening around the country.  There needs to be uniformity.  It is an issue on which we need a debate with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p><p>Senator Ward spoke about the increase in the cost of the postage stamp and that it did not necessarily mean supporting the continuation of post offices or indeed staff.  I was surprised when I heard about it on the radio.  I do not really know what the rationale is.  We need to look for the rationale.  We also need to acknowledge the great service post offices and their staff gave, particularly during Covid.  They were just incredible in terms of the contact they gave to many elderly people who live on their own.  They did messages for them during Covid.  It is important to know that.<\/p><p>Senator Carrigy spoke about those working in long-term residential settings and suggested they should be included in the &euro;1,000 bonus.  My understanding is that the matter was clarified at Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il today.  Those in section 39 organisations will be covered.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is most important.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan spoke about forestry and harvesting and felling being a real issue and the need for a debate on the matter.  We had a debate on the issue last year but we will certainly look to organise another one.  On the issue raised by Senator Cummins, I wish to congratulate Waterford City and County Council on its achievement.  It is great that it is doing such incredible work.  I congratulate the leadership of the mayor, Joe Kelly, all the councillors, the chief executive and all the staff.  I did not see the \"Prime Time\" programme, but I will watch it.  It is important that when a local authority gets it right, we look at how it did it and the actions it had taken to see how we can follow that around the country.  It is a huge issue and a large light has been shone on it.  We must look to see if we can run some other pilot programme in other counties and see what we can do.  I thank Senator Cummins for bringing that to our attention.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the passports issue.  There is no doubt that the system needs an overhaul.  The Passport Office closed down completely during the first Covid lockdown.  At the time, I thought it was nonsensical that it was considered a non-essential service.  It is playing catch-up now.  The initiative that has been proposed that people should have to check their passport status when they book holidays, could be an interesting one.<\/p><p>Senator Currie spoke about survivors and how we need to support all victims.  I absolutely agree that we do.  Senator Burke spoke about the Planning and Development Act and requested a debate on the matter.  I think he is correct.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has outlined some initiatives that he wants to put in place.  I agree that it should happen, but I think it cannot happen without reference to Irish Water because many of the problems and issues that we have are down to problems with the Irish Water infrastructure.  I look forward to that debate.  The Senator also made a very pertinent point about the RTB and issues that are raised on behalf of landlords as well as residents.  There needs to be balance in the provision of support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#Y00700","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: \"That No. 15 be taken before No. 1.\"  The Acting Leader has indicated that she is prepared to accept the amendment.

I have set three objectives in my role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These are as follows: to help businesses respond to Covid and Brexit and to survive and prosper again; to restore and exceed pre-pandemic employment levels by achieving a target of a record 2.5 million people at work in Ireland by 2024 and ensure there are job opportunities in all parts of the country; and to create jobs with better terms and conditions, that are more sustainable, secure and valued.  As part of implementing this third policy, I plan to establish five new workers' rights this year.  These are a new public holiday, statutory sick pay, the right to request remote working, new rights around redundancy for people laid off during the pandemic, and better protection of workplace tips.<\/p> <p>As today is 1 February, it is fitting to mention that from next year we will have an extra public holiday at the start of February to mark Imbolc or St. Brigid&rsquo;s Day.  It will be observed on the first Monday of February, except where 1 February falls on a Friday in which case it will be observed on that day.  This will be the first Irish public holiday named after a woman who is also a Christian saint.  It marks the half-way point between the winter solstice and the equinox at the beginning of spring which was the Celtic new year.  The creation of a tenth public holiday will also bring Ireland more into line with the European average.<\/p> <p>Turning to the Bill before the House on tips and gratuities, I acknowledge the role of the Leader of the Seanad, Senator Doherty, in its development.  She made significant progress on it during her time as Minister in the last Government and I look forward to working with her and all of the House as we bring it through the Oireachtas.  I also acknowledge Senators Warfield and Gavan, and former Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, for their Private Members' Bill on this matter in the previous Seanad.  I am aware that other parties had different proposals to the Government.  I am sure this Bill is not perfect and can be improved, and I am open to amendments that are workable, beneficial and constitutional.  I thank the Low Pay Commission and the Workplace Relations Commission for their practical advice on this matter.<\/p> <p>On the face of it, this seems like a straightforward issue.  As is often the case, when we delved into it more and more we found it was not.  It is difficult to find the right way to approach some of the nuances.  We have done the best we can to do so.  To provide some background and context, there has been anecdotal evidence that a minority of employers, particularly in the restaurant and hospitality sectors, sometimes use tips or gratuities given by customers and intended for staff as a means of meeting their payroll obligations and other overheads.  There is no legislation which obliges employers to pass on any tips received by them to their staff.  Therefore, customers have no way of knowing for sure whether the tips they left were given to the intended recipient or recipients, and the workers have no protection if their employer chooses to keep some or all the tips left by customers.<\/p> <p>While most employers treat their staff very well, we have all heard stories that some tips are simply included as part of overall business income or used to contribute to employees' contractual base wages.  With this in mind, a Bill was brought forward by Senator Doherty when she was Minister for Social Protection.  It underwent pre-legislative scrutiny before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection on 10 October 2019 and the committee&rsquo;s report was published on 11 November 2019.  The legislation fell when the general election was called in early 2020.<\/p> <p>The Low Pay Commission and the Workplace Relations Commission have advised that heavy regulation in this area is not necessary and could even backfire by undermining some informal arrangements that are working well from the point of view of workers.  We have also been strongly advised that trying to regulate cash tips too tightly would be unenforceable where those cash tips are controlled by staff and never go through the employer's books.  The main sectors to which the Bill will apply are tourism, hospitality, hair and beauty, taxi and delivery services but legally it will apply in all settings and this needs to be borne in mind.  This is not just about restaurants and bars.<\/p> <p>I emphasise that it is important that the tourism and hospitality sectors are seen as valued and sustainable career choices.  The Bill will bring clarity and transparency to this important aspect of the tourism sector work experience.  These sectors tend to attract younger people, students and migrant workers for whom English is often not their first language.  A recent survey undertaken by Unite the Union, along with research carried out by Dr. Deirdre Curran of NUI Galway, found that a significant number of workers simply do not know their employment rights.  The Bill will have a beneficial impact for all these groups and will provide clarity and transparency on the meaning of tips, gratuities and service charges.  It will also give customers clear information on where their tips and service charges go.  Many customers believe service charges are tips.  This is certainly not always the case.<\/p> <p>The Bill has a number of main aims.  It will prohibit employers from using tips and gratuities to make up contractual rates of pay.  An employer cannot make a deduction from a person&rsquo;s wage regarding tips.  The policy intent is to ensure tips and gratuities are additional to the wages in all circumstances.  The Bill will provide a legal entitlement for workers to receive tips and gratuities paid in electronic form, that is by debit or credit card or other electronic means such as apps, with a provision that these tips and gratuities should be paid out to workers in a fair and transparent manner.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The employer must provide a statement to workers showing the amount of tips obtained in a period and the portion paid to the individual employee for that particular period.  An employer may not retain any share of tips received electronically, unless such retention is required by this Act, for example, to pay tax or bank charges arising from providing electronic modes of tipping, or only where he or she regularly performs to a substantial degree the same work performed by some or all the employees, such an amount that is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  The Bill will also require businesses to clearly display their policy on how tips, gratuities and mandatory service charges are distributed.  The customer will be better informed about how tips are treated.  The Bill also provides for similar provisions for new models of work such as platform workers who are not employees but their work typically attracts tips, for example, food takeaway delivery apps.<br\/><br\/>While employers will be required to include detail on how cash tips are dealt with when displaying their policy towards tips and gratuities there will be no other regulation of cash tips as this is, according to the WRC, not workable.  Cash tips are not accountable and are not under the control of the employer.  They are controlled by the staff and to bring them under the control of the employer or legislation such as this could have unwelcome consequences for workers in terms of income tax and social welfare as receipt of them would no longer be a matter of self-declaration.  <br\/><br\/>Payment of tips and gratuities by electronic means, in contrast to cash tips paid directly to the worker go through employers&rsquo; books and the employer is in control of how these tips and gratuities are distributed.  The electronic record generated by this payment method will facilitate inspections by the WRC.<br\/><br\/>With an ever-increasing number of ways of tipping using cashless and contactless apps such as Strikepay and TiPJAR, the payment of tips by electronic means may well become the predominant way of tipping staff into the future.  It should be noted that tipping apps can be utilised to ensure electronically paid tips go to staff directly and not through the employer.<br\/><br\/>There will be no interference with schemes where tips are managed by employees themselves, for example, under a tronc system.  These can continue to operate as they currently do.  A tronc scheme is a common fund into which tips and gratuities are paid to be divided out among staff according to a certain formula.  The employer has no role in determining the allocation of tips.  Troncs are common in hospitality, gambling and leisure sectors.  The operation of these schemes is not affected by this Bill.<br\/><br\/>There will also be no change in the tax treatment of tips and gratuities.  At the moment service charges are a grey area.  Many customers believe that a service charge is a tip. This is not the case, at least not in law.  The Bill will maintain the position that mandatory service charges levied by a business, as distinct from voluntary and discretionary tips and gratuities, form part of business revenues.  I have asked my officials to consider an amendment that would prohibit the use of mandatory service charges to make up wages and to require that they go to staff as income.  Discretionary service charges, however, will fall within the Bill&rsquo;s definition of &quot;tips and gratuities&quot; and the Bill will apply to these types of voluntary customer payments.  Our understanding is that a portion of mandatory service charges often go towards tips.  For example, a hotel may have an arrangement where it has been agreed with staff that out of all 12% mandatory service charge, 3% goes to the staff as tips.  By requiring businesses to display their tips and service charge policies, this will ensure transparency.<br\/><br\/>Regarding redress, an officer of the WRC when adjudicating on a complaint may take into account certain factors when determining whether tips were distributed fairly, including the seniority or experience of an employee, the value of sales generated by him or her and the number of hours worked.  All employees must be consulted on the policy that is introduced.  <br\/><br\/>I am conscious of cost concerns for businesses when introducing any new laws, particularly small and medium enterprises and those along the Border competing with businesses in Northern Ireland where workers' rights are different, often weaker and wages and costs lower.  There may be a minor cost burden to industry with employers having to prominently display a statutory notice on the employer&rsquo;s tips and gratuities and mandatory service charges policy.  However, information will be provided by my Department and the WRC in the form of templates for policies on tips to assist employers to develop their own policy and to help them identify the types of information and procedures that should be outlined and displayed in their policy.  These templates will be promoted and circulated widely to assist with compliance and help minimise the burden on micro and small enterprises.  The requirement for employers to provide a statement to workers when a payment is being made will also impose a burden.  However, as this requirement applies only to electronic tips, the existing electronic records will aid in the efficiency of producing the statement and minimise the administrative burden involved.<br\/><br\/>I will now provide a brief explanation of the various sections of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for definitions used within the Act.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 inserts new definitions for &quot;tips&quot;, &quot;gratuities&quot; and &quot;mandatory service charges&quot; in the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  <br\/><br\/>Section 3 inserts four new sections, 4A to 4D, in the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  The new section 4A will enable me, as Minister, to make regulations to prescribe the employers or class of employers to which the new sections 4B to 4D of the Payment of Wages Act 1991 will apply.  It will also enable me, as Minister, to prescribe by regulation an employer or a class of employers, to which sections 4B to 4D do not apply.  Under the next section 4B,<b><\/b>employers will be required to distribute fairly and in a transparent manner tips that are received in electronic form through debit or credit cards, other smart-type payment cards or payment apps, as the case may be.  Employers will not be allowed to retain any share of tips or gratuities received by an employer electronically unless such retention is required or permitted by this Act.  Only where the employer regularly performs to a substantial degree the same work as is performed by some or all of the employees will the employer be allowed to retain an amount that is fair and reasonable in the circumstances - in other words, a share that is proportionate to the amount of work that he or she, as employer, performs. <br\/><br\/>In considering a complaint on whether a distribution of tips and gratuities to an employee is fair, an adjudication officer of the WRC might have regard to all the factors or circumstances that he or she considers relevant.  Section 4B also requires an employer to provide a statement to workers showing the amount of tips, including discretionary service charges, obtained in a period and the portion paid to individual employees for that particular period.  This will further ensure transparency in the amount of tips shared.  An employer before establishing or making a material change to his or her policy on the distribution of tips or gratuities or the treatment of mandatory service charges will be required to consult with those employees.  <br\/><br\/>A new section 4C<b><\/b>will prohibit an employer from making a deduction from an employee&rsquo;s wages in respect of tips or gratuities made to, or left for, an employee, or make a deduction from an employee&rsquo;s tips or other gratuities other than as required under statute or by any instrument made under statute, or to the extent required to meet costs directly arising from providing electronic modes of payment for tips.  A new section 4D requires the employer to display a tips and gratuities notice stating whether tips or gratuities are distributed to and among employees, the manner in which they are distributed and the amounts so distributed, and also whether services charges, or any portion of them, are distributed to and among employees and, if so, the manner in which they are distributed and the amounts so distributed.  Section 4D also allows me, as Minister, to make regulations regarding the information that must be contained in a tips and gratuities notice and the way or particular locations at which a tips and gratuities notice must be displayed.  This includes a website or other online digital platform hosted by the employer or at the place of business at which employees perform their work or service.<br\/><br\/>A new section 4E requires prescribed persons to display a contract workers tips and gratuities notice stating whether tips or gratuities are distributed to and among contract workers, the manner in which they are distributed and the amounts so distributed, and whether services charges, or any portion of them, are distributed to and among contract workers and, if so, the manner in which they are distributed and the amounts so distributed.  For example, this would cover businesses that contract with platform workers who are not direct employees but whose work typically attracts tips and gratuities.  Section 4E also allows me, as Minister, to make regulations regarding the information that must be contained in a contract workers tips and gratuities notice and the way or particular locations at which a tips and gratuities notice must be displayed.  For the purposes of section 4E, &quot;contract worker&quot; is defined as a natural person who carries out work other than as an employee, including on a contract for service, for a person to whom this section applies.<br\/><br\/>Section 4 provides for an amendment to section 6 of the Payment of Wages Act 1991 that will provide for an adjudication officer of the WRC to direct an employer to repay any unlawful deduction of tips or gratuities arising from a complaint.<br\/><br\/>Section 5 provides for an amendment to section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.  This means that a statement regarding the employer&rsquo;s policy on the way tips or gratuities and mandatory service charges are treated will become part of the core terms that a new employee is to be furnished with within five days of commencing employment.<br\/><br\/>Sections 6, 7 and 8 deal with enforcement and compliance issues and provide for the relevant amendments to be made to the Workplace Relations Act of 2015.  This enables and authorises the WRC to carry out inspections and to take complaints regarding compliance with the new requirements set out in this Act.<br\/><br\/>Section 9 relates to the Short Title, commencement, and collective citation of the Act. <br\/><br\/>Most employers do their best to ensure tips are distributed fairly among their staff.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Leo Varadkar:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The aim of this Bill is to make sure that is the case across the board, giving employees a new legal right that currently does not exist.<\/p><p>Most customers are unsure where their tips go and of the difference between a tip and a service charge.

An important requirement of the new Bill is that an employer must provide a statement to workers showing the value of electronic tips obtained in a period and the portion paid to the individual employee for that period.  This will ensure transparency for workers.<\/p><p>This Bill provides for one of five new workers' rights that the Government is introducing this year.  We are determined to make better working conditions a legacy of the pandemic and the Government.  I firmly believe this is necessary if we are to recruit and retain the staff we will need to drive our enterprise economy forward.

I acknowledge Senator Doherty's previous role, as Minister responsible for employment affairs, and her role in bringing this Bill to a certain stage.<\/p> <p>There has always been confusion over tips.  I was examining some of the main issues that hospitality workers spoke about in respect of dealing with tips with employers.  Some workers do not even receive tips; for others, tips are regarded as part of their pay.  I worked in bars and restaurants in the hospitality industry for more than ten years and noted there was always a different policy on tips no matter where I worked.  In some places, the bar or restaurant staff took them, and in others they were shared by chefs or management.  In my time, there always seemed to be a different policy for every place of employment in the hospitality sector.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, this Bill is about bringing transparency.  It is important to support employees.<\/p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the four main aims of the Bill: to prohibit employers from using tips and gratuities to \"make up\" rates of pay; to provide a legal entitlement for workers to receive tips and gratuities paid in electronic form; to ensure an employer may not retain any share of tips received electronically; and to require businesses to clearly display their policy on how tips, gratuities and mandatory service charges are distributed.  Ultimately, as he said, there are good employers who go above and beyond in supporting staff with tips and who, based on my experience, actually add to them in some instances as a token of appreciation, and there are employers who do not do that, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>One of the main points is the transparency the legislation affords.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about it in respect of service charges.  Only a few days ago, I was out for a meal and, because there was a table of six, there was a service charge of 10%.  When paying, we were asking whether a tip should be left.  Some people felt the service charge was a tip, while others felt the service charge was not necessarily a tip.  This Bill brings clarity in that regard, which is important because, as we all know, service charges in certain establishments are not necessarily tips that go to the employees.  We often see customers waiting to find a person who offered them excellent service to tip them because they are unsure whether their tip will go to that person if it is left on the table.  Therefore, having a Bill like this is important.<\/p> <p>The facility to give tips electronically will be used more and more, especially after Covid, because people have become so used to it.  While I realise there is a difficulty in giving electronically paid tips to the employee rather than the employer, I would look for some sort of solution to this, in particular.<\/p> <p>As the T&aacute;naiste stated, this Bill is about protecting employees.  The current and previous Governments introduced a range of measures in this regard.  It raised the minimum wage and offered supports during Covid.  It is to provide for a right to request remote working.  The sick pay legislation that will come through this year will also support employees, which is really important.  The Bill under discussion is another facet to that, which is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#HH00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ahern for sharing his time because I am an interloper today.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for introducing this Bill.  I was involved in it when I was Minister.  The T&aacute;naiste is well aware that when Governments fall, priorities are not always the same for the following Minister, who may have a different agenda.  I am grateful that he followed through on this.  The past couple of years have been horrendous for the hospitality and service industries.  The timing is very appropriate.<\/p> <p>There is an old saying that all politics is personal.  The reason this Bill is so personal for me was that I met some of the people making complaints about their employers.  The T&aacute;naiste is right to point out that it is usually only a small number of employers who abuse the trust of their employees.  The latter were treated appallingly.  We have many really good employers in the main, but when employers are bad, they really are bad.  The employees I met were just so lovely, genuine and hard-working.  They actually enjoyed working in their industry.  Not only is it a very people-oriented industry but, because of the tips, it can also have benefits.  Owing to tips, people can train, be in education or spend time at home with their children while still working and earning a decent living.  However, when the trust is eroded, it can feel really personal.<\/p> <p>There are one or two aspects of the Bill that I believe are really important.  Knowledge is key in that power is given to the patron when he or she knows exactly what the tips policy is.  It is important that the policy be displayed prominently in a way that makes it clear to every patron.  Thus, patrons will know exactly where their money is going and will be in control.  If there is any doubt about a service charge or a percentage of a tip going somewhere they do not want it to go to, they can use their feet and pay cash directly to the person they want it to go to.  Therefore, displaying the policy is really important.<\/p> <p>As Senator Ahearn said, I am aware the T&aacute;naiste would have liked to do something about service charges.  Maybe it should be explored further.  Again, knowledge is important in that if somebody is aware that the service charge is going entirely to the establishment, but not the staff, he or she can decide how to or whether to tip.<\/p> <p>I am fully supportive of 99% of the Bill.  There is one aspect I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider amending, if he does not mind.  It is the proposed section 4B.  When people tip these days by using their card, the transaction has to go through the till system.  Very few employers declare tips and pay tax on them.  They do a cash-out at the end of the night or week and the tips are then distributed according to establishment policy.  I would like the T&aacute;naiste to take the control away from the employer.  In the proposed section 4B, it is outlined that when an employer is changing the policy, he or she must consult the employees.  The employer should not have to consult; he or she should have to obtain consent.  Ultimately, if I go into an establishment and leave &euro;5, &euro;25 or another amount behind, it is because I will have appreciated the good service.  In many cases, I will not mind whether 75% goes to the young lady or man who has served me and 25% goes to the people who have cooked the meal; it is up to them to work it out.  However, it is certainly not something that should be controlled by the employer.  He or she should, under the policy, have the consent of those who are working hard and earning the tips daily.<\/p> <p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for introducing this Bill.  It will mean an awful lot to the people who work in and support the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#HH00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator, including for her impeccable timing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#HH00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome to the House.

Those chances were how much I could earn in tips, and it was necessary to work myself to the bone to ensure that I got the maximum for the night.  This Bill is welcome.  Before I get into the legislation itself, I thank former Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and Senator Gavan who introduced it.  Senator Doherty was probably the finest Minister for Social Protection that we had at the start of this pandemic.  That is not to take away from the current Minister.  When then Deputy Doherty was the Minister, however, she certainly grabbed the nation&rsquo;s spirit in the way in which she took on the issues which faced families that were in real stress at the time.<\/p><p>I approached the T&aacute;naiste some years ago about class K PRSI contributions and he immediately acted on the issue for city and county councillors and changed them to class S contributions instead.  It is regrettable that we did not do that for sitting Members of this House.  Some who lost their seats in the last election have suffered real poverty because of not having social protection contributions.<\/p><p>Returning to the Bill, tipping is an important social act.  It is the way in which we can acknowledge the excellence of those who serve and look after us.  It motivates people to work that little bit harder and, very often, waiting staff and people working in garages, or wherever, go beyond the ordinary to deliver the best possible service.  Workers will welcome the clarity that this legislation on tips will bring.  Tips are a crucial part of many people&rsquo;s earnings.  Senator Doherty and other speakers have made that point.<\/p><p>The bottom line here is that wages tend to be fairly poor in the service industry but tips make the difference.  Workers who work hard are entitled to their tips.  Covid-19 has greatly affected employers and employees in the hospitality and tourism industry.  In fairness to the Government of which the T&aacute;naiste is a member, it has worked hard to ensure that it supported those industries through the worst of times.  Generally speaking, the public are very grateful for what was done.  In years to come, history will reward the T&aacute;naiste for the work done.  During the time he was running a temporary or skeleton Government between the election and the formation of this Government, he took some brave decisions and I acknowledge that.<\/p><p>This legislation is well timed as the hospitality, transport and tourism sectors are returning.  I hope it will entice workers to go back into those sectors.  On a recent trip to my home town in Galway, I noticed the difficulty in finding chefs.  Many of them left the industry during the pandemic and they have not returned.  I hope we will now see some of them return to the industry.  This brings me to the subject of the distribution of tips.  It is important that backroom staff are looked after as well as those out front of house.  My colleague, Senator McDowell, said to me the other day that if someone serves him well and he wants to hand him or her &euro;20, then he does not want that person to have to hand in that tip anywhere.  He wants to be able to give the &euro;20 to him or her.  That type of context is provided for in this legislation and that is a good thing.<\/p><p>Turning to the issue of electronic payments, it would be great if we could guarantee that when tips are paid and distributed to people in this way that they will at no stage ever form part of PAYE, USC or PRSI contributions.  I agree with Senator Doherty about the service charge issue, and the T&aacute;naiste will investigate this issue, judging from what he said.  When employees come together to look at their tips, it is important that they explore a fair distribution of that money among themselves.  It is not fair, for example, if employees on permanent contracts take all the tips and the casually-employed people do not get a share.  This aspect must be negotiated by the employees themselves.<\/p><p>This Bill will provide a healthier and fairer working environment.  I welcome almost everything in the legislation.  We may have one or two small amendments as we consider it.  From the employers' standpoint, I would like to see a way in which we could audit tips paid electronically to ensure they are all being transferred to the employees.  I do not know if such a measure would fit into the legislation now, but I will take the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s direction on this point.<\/p><p>I am delighted to see that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is being involved in this legislation.  From my experience in the trade union movement, however, and I am sure other speakers will agree with me, the WRC is already overburdened.  If we are going to ask that body to be a party to this legislation, then it should be provided with the resources it will need to adjudicate in this context.<\/p><p>In my two interactions with the T&aacute;naiste here, and I think we have only interacted twice in this House regarding legislation, he has shown that he is always willing to listen.  This is a good move on his part.  I compliment him on the employment figures, which are looking good, and the economy looks like it could come back fairly strong in the months to come.  I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste and the Government on that.  The T&aacute;naiste should not worry, though, because a chance will come in future for me to have a lash at him for something else.  Credit must be given where credit is due, however.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#HH00500","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell.

I acknowledge Senators Doherty and Gavan, and former Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, my own county man, for the work they did before the Government brought forward this legislation.  I welcome the Bill, in the main, because it will provide certainty for workers.  Most hospitality businesses in west Galway have almost always treated their employees well and divided tips fairly.  On occasion, there have been incidents where that has not been the case, but it has been a minority of businesses that have not followed the tradition.  When the tips campaign was at its height during the last 18 months, I noticed that most employers in Galway city fully supported it.<\/p> <p>From my experience, tips create trust between the employee and the employer, and that naturally leads to longer employment and to people working in places for several years and beyond.  This is an important factor, because if there is trust between the employee and the employer, then at least progress is being made.  Ultimately, the customer will feel that employees are doing their jobs and feel more comfortable.  This creates certainty.<\/p> <p>The legislation will also provide greater certainty for customers as it will require businesses to display their cash and credit tipping policies in a prominent place.  Customers who choose to tip should be entitled to know where those tips will go, and this Bill will provide that certainty.  It is particularly welcome that this Bill will give employees a legal entitlement to receive tips and gratuities paid in electronic form, with the provision that these tips and gratuities should be paid to workers in a fair, transparent and equitable manner.  Fair and equitable distribution will be context-specific and is likely to consider factors such as staff hours, value of sales income, revenue generated, workers' role in service delivery and whether employees have full-time or part-time contracts of employment, as Senator Craughwell referred to earlier.<\/p> <p>Again, most businesses were already dividing tips in a fair manner, but the small numbers that were not have attracted considerable coverage in recent years.  That has had a negative impact on workers.  People want to tip for good service, but they are reluctant to do so because they are not confident that tips paid electronically will end up with the employees.  Many people working in the hospitality industry are eager to see this Bill passed because they believe it will impact considerably on the tips that customers will choose to give when there is full transparency regarding how such tips will be distributed.  In many cases, the &euro;30, &euro;40 or &euro;50 made each evening is vital for people&rsquo;s living arrangements and pays for the reasonable quality of life that people deserve.  This legislation will also improve people's motivation to work in the hospitality sector.  That is an important aspect.<\/p> <p>This legislation is supported by all business owners with whom I have spoken.  I can honestly say that is the case in Galway city.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland has made public its support for the Bill and its eagerness to see the legislation implemented as quickly as possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ollie Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In recent years cash has become a less common method of paying and Covid-19 has further sped up that trend.  The payment of tips and gratuities by electronic means, in contrast with cash tips that are paid directly to the worker, means that the employer is in control of how tips and gratuities are distributed.  The electronic record generated by this payment method will support and facilitate inspections by the WRC in the event of a complaint being made.  That is significant and important because it means that should any establishment not follow the guidelines set out in this Bill, workers will have the ability to raise it with the WRC, which will then have the capacity to carry out an investigation.  Certainly, the WRC might need further support and an increase in numbers.<br\/><br\/>I believe this legislation will ensure a very high compliance rate across businesses in general.  The transparency that businesses will be required to show their employees, under this Bill, is also significant in my opinion.  To add transparency to the distribution of tips, the Bill provides that an employer must distribute the tips no later than ten days - I believe it should be within a week - from the date on which the tips and gratuities are paid.  From my own experience in Galway, the normal procedure is that tips are distributed at the end of the night and on a nightly basis.  I believe it should be done on a nightly basis or at the very least when wages are paid on a Thursday or Friday night in normal bars, restaurants and hotels.  To aid transparency, the Bill also provides that an employee will receive a statement in writing that specifies the total amount of tips and gratuities distributed by the employer for the period to which the statement relates, and the amount of tips and gratuities distributed to the employee to whom the statement is provided.<br\/><br\/>Again, it is better for the longevity of a business and better for the people who work in that business that there is good trust between the employee and employer, which will naturally happen if there is fairness and equity.  I can honestly say that vast majority of businesses in Galway appear to give tips to staff.  It is correct to say that a better quality of staff leads to a better run business.  When one has a quality chef, quality front-of-house manager and quality waiting staff, one's business is on the right road.  As a business operator I know that if one respects people and builds trust with them, one will get there.<br\/><br\/>In the last 18 months the hospitality sector has suffered more than any sector.  During that time I have noticed the kindness and generosity shown by customers when there was table service only.  Possibly in bars and some restaurants at lunchtime people might not leave a tip but they certainly had more respect for staff, and appreciated the conditions under which they had to work.  This Bill clarifies that there is an onus and responsibility on the employer, which is welcome.<br\/><br\/>To finish, the Bill will vastly enhance transparency for both workers and customers in the hospitality sector.  It greatly enhances the legal rights of workers with regard to tips.  It will make no impact on the vast majority of businesses, to which the T&aacute;naiste alluded.  As I know at first hand, there is no extra cost for business owners who already distribute tips in a fair and balanced manner.  The Bill is a significant improvement to the <i>status quo<\/i>and I greatly welcome it.  I hope it can be implemented with as much speed as possible, and certainly before the summer period, which as all Members of the House are aware is the peak of the year in terms of hospitality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#JJ00300","speaker":"1646","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Cuirim\u00a0f&aacute;ilte romhat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and happy St. Brigid's Day.  It is good that we are springing into action on this very important Bill.  I welcome the work that the T&aacute;naiste has done on this legislation.<\/p> <p>I agree with the phrase that once a waitress, always a waitress.  Even now when I eat out with people I cannot help stacking the plates and wiping the table.  I have worked as a waitress in Germany, America and Ireland, and waitressing has gotten me through certain stages of my life.  I always remember the buzz when someone bothered to leave a tip or appreciated my work and acknowledged my existence as a person, opposed to some kind of a removed thing who serves customers.  For that reason, I think tips play a huge part in showing respect for the service industry.  The industry in Ireland has suffered in some ways.  It is not easy to recruit people.  This Bill will give new confidence to the whole service industry because there was a lot of bad press when a small number of employers did not share tips.  I remember joining a picket line a few years ago at a restaurant located not very far from here because I discovered that the staff did not get their tips.  I joined because as a waitress I understood how the staff felt.  This is a really positive Bill in that context.<\/p> <p>I live in north Clare.  It is a beautiful place so we have lots of visitors and lots of great caf&eacute;s.  Many people I know, including friends of mine, work in the service industry as waiters and waitresses.  I am sure that there is a better term now to describe their work but they serve people at tables.  I think the legislation is great because it is hard to find people to do such work.  As Senator Crowe alluded to, if there is a new confidence in the industry, that might help to stabilise the situation because staff come and go.  One of the problems with the tipping system, especially with the greater use of cards, is that many customers do not have confidence that their money will go to the person who impressed them by providing a quality service.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides four main changes.  For other people who are not here today, the Bill will give employees a legal entitlement to receive tips and gratuities paid by card; oblige employers to prominently display their policy, which is important as it will give confidence to customers that the employers will distribute the cash and card tips; and oblige employers to fairly distribute tips.  This legislation will not affect businesses where tips are managed by employees, which is also very important because that is often the case.  Employers are often happy to let their employees figure out tips between them and I think that is called the tronc system.<\/p> <p>The Bill will assist anyone who is on a low income.  Even though tipping is more of an American thing, it has become more prevalent here.  People who do their job well in the service industry deserve a tip, if one feels like giving it to them.  Waiting staff are often the lowest income earners in the country.  Tips can make such a difference to you if you are on a low income.  A good tip at the end of the night can really put you in better form, especially if you might not have done a good job that day.  If tips are spread evenly, everyone benefits, which is really important.<\/p> <p>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, published a paper in 2020 on minimum wage policy in Ireland.  It found that 8% of employees are on the minimum wage and half of them work in the services sector.  So it is really good that we are looking at that.  I hope that the quality of life of these people will improve if customers feel more confident to give them tips and that employers will ensure their staff get tips.<\/p> <p>The Bill will help to tackle the gender pay gap because a lot more women work in the sector than men.  I do not know why that is the case because women are not born with an extra skill in how to set and clear tables.  That is just the way it is in a patriarchal society, but you have that with lots of other things.<\/p> <p>The people who work in the service industry have had some of the riskiest jobs during the pandemic.  They have been on the front line in terms of hospitality and it is right that they should be fairly compensated for their work.  It is right that people who leave tips in restaurants know that their money goes to staff, which is what most people believe happens when they leave a tip.  I am still a cash kind of girl and it is only since I came to Dublin that I have started to use cards more often.  I always feel confident leaving my cash behind me on a table but I do not always have confidence leaving a gratuity on the machine.  Plus, I forget to tip because I am not used to using a card in that way and I am used to putting the money on the table.<\/p> <p>This legislation is an important step in implementing a living wage and tackling costs of living because a lot of low-income earners are waiters and waitresses.  The Bill is an important step in moving towards a living wage.  The current minimum wage in Ireland is &euro;10.50 per hour.  We have made a commitment in the programme for Government to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.  It is important that we address this and also the high costs that families face, including high rent and childcare costs.  The Government is committed to doing this.  I want to particularly note the work being done on this by my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, whom I know has worked with the T&aacute;naiste.  The Minister is transforming the childcare model in Ireland, which will see services increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed.<\/p> <p>I note that the Low Pay Commission is due to report back to the T&aacute;naiste on progressing towards a living wage and I thank him for his work on that.  I ask him to update us on the timeline and content of the report.<\/p> <p>When this Bill is passed, will we do a proper public campaign to ensure all employers and employees become aware of the legislation and are fully informed?  I do not know whether we should use billboards for that.  I know we can write to every business but they get letters from everybody on everything.  When the Bill is passed, it would be good to ensure the information is out there because I remember what it was like when I was a young waitress.  I remember getting to the end of a hard working day and knowing that I had done a really good job but getting very few tips or none.  I did not have the confidence to ask my employer where the tips were.  I realise that there is still a small group in the sector who may not be assertive enough to ask for their tips.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was quite an assertive 17-year-old, but I was not assertive enough to ask for my tips.

It is nice to see him and it is nice to see the Bill.  I welcome it on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Some of us have been on a long campaign journey in respect of this issue.  Today is an important day on that journey and I wish to acknowledge in particular my colleagues in the trade union movement, the One Galway movement, SIPTU, Mandate and Unite who have campaigned tirelessly on this issue for many years.  I, along with my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, was very proud to present a Bill on this very issue alongside our trade union brothers and sisters back in 2017.  That Bill subsequently passed all Stages in the Seanad despite the opposition of Fine Gael but, more important, it kicked off a national conversation about tips and the importance of legislating for the protection of employee tips.  Since then, there has been consistent further campaigning by the trade union movement.  The T&aacute;naiste's Department has had important engagements with it on this issue which I welcome.  I particularly welcome the recognition of the work done by Dr. Deirdre Curran of NUI Galway.  She has been a tireless campaigner for employee rights across the hospitality sector and on this issue.  The Bill is very welcome.<\/p> <p>A significant amount of research has been done.  Sinn F&eacute;in research carried out in 2016 indicated that one in three workers in hospitality were not getting their tips.  The research by Dr. Curran suggested that figure was one in four.  More recent research undertaken by Unite suggests the figure may be closer to 50%.  I acknowledge, as have other Senators, that the majority of employers in the sector are very good.  Senator Crowe is correct - one builds trust with employees by playing honestly and fairly with them in terms of tips and how they are distributed.  Let us be clear that there is a problem, however.  The research indicates there has been a problem in this sector for some time and it needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the Bill does several important things.  It places tips and gratuities outside the scope of a person's contractual wages, ensuring that tips cannot be used to top up a worker's wage.  This is important and very welcome.  The obligation on employers to display prominently their policy on the distribution of cash and electronic tips is also worthwhile.  The clear obligation on employers to distribute all electronic tips is welcome.  As the T&aacute;naiste mentioned, that seems to be the way payments are going in the sector.<\/p> <p>Crucially, the Bill will establish a right of redress for employees.  This is why I started the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill in the first place.  I came across an employee in Limerick whose restaurant manager and business owner taunted her at nights, taking the tips of &euro;5 and &euro;10 and saying, \"My restaurant, my tips\", before walking away.  I wanted to bring a case to the Workplace Relations Commission on her behalf but, of course, I found there was no right of redress.  The good news in the context of the Bill is there is now a right of redress in respect of electronic payments.   That does not seem to be the case in respect of cash payments.  I may be wrong, but that is how I am reading the Bill.  I take the point made by the T&aacute;naiste that it is more complicated but I still think something should be done in this regard because, to take the example I have just given, even after the Bill is passed, the woman to whom I referred will have no right of redress for those cash tips.  We should try to ensure there is a right of redress not just for electronic tips, but cash tips also.  That would be a good improvement to the Bill.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the fact that the T&aacute;naiste stated he will work with us on amendments.  I know he gave the same message to the Unite union in particular just two weeks ago.  I welcome that and we will work with him positively to strengthen the Bill.<\/p> <p>My biggest concern relates to service charges.  One of the five stated purposes of the Bill is to \"leave the status quo in relation to mandatory service charges forming part of the revenue of a business\".  I have a problem with this.  Service charges should not form part of the revenue of a business.  To digress momentarily, I discovered just last week how service charges came about in Ireland.  They came about as a result of a strike in hotels in Dublin that went on for several months in 1951.  The solution to that strike was a collective agreement between unions and hotels to introduce a service charge.  The service charge would be owned by the employees through the trade unions and distributed through the trade unions.  That is how service charges came about.  They were to ensure justice and better pay for workers in hotels in Dublin.<\/p> <p>As Dr. Deirdre Curran asked in an article published last week, \"When did it become accepted there that service charges are the prerogative of the employer and why?\"  I welcome the indication by the T&aacute;naiste that he has asked his officials to consider an amendment that would also prohibit the use of mandatory service charges to make up wages and would require that such service charges go to staff as income.  That is what needs to happen because, as the T&aacute;naiste stated, when people go to restaurants and see a service charge, they make the assumption that it is going to the workers and they will probably not give a tip on top of it.  Bearing in mind from where service charges in this country come, let us do what is right by the workers.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will work positively with us in that regard.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be bringing forward an amendment on this issue but we are keen to work constructively with the T&aacute;naiste in respect of that particular issue.<\/p> <p>In my final couple of minutes, I wish to clarify another point.  I think the T&aacute;naiste was saying in his speech that, basically, optional service charges and discretionary service charges are now being deemed to be the same as tips and gratuities.  If that is correct, it is a very welcome clarification because that was another concern the unions raised with me.<\/p> <p>The final point I wish to make is in the broader context of the industry.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that in 2008 the joint labour committee, JLC, system for the hospitality sector was struck down by employers.  That was a significant blow to workers in the industry because that system did not just establish tiered rates of pay such that one could look forward to a career in the industry, it also dealt with issues such as paid breaks, overtime rates, Sunday premiums, holiday entitlements and sick pay.  These were laws that protected low-paid and sweated labour and predated the foundation of the State.  It was a significant blow to have those laws struck down by the High Court.<\/p> <p>It was a colleague of the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Bruton, who reinstated legislation for JLCs in 2012.  Here is the difficulty, however.  For ten years now, employer groups in the hospitality sector have refused to engage with that process.  We are coming out of a pandemic and a phrase all present like to use - I think we all mean it - is that we want to build back better.   We will not build back better if we do not reinstate a floor of decency across the sector in terms of minimum conditions and standards agreed through negotiation with the trade union movement.  The Government has rightly given a range of supports to keep the hospitality sector going through the pandemic.  Is it really too much to ask that, in return for those supports, the employer groups sit down with trade unions and re-establish a JLC?  To me, it was shocking to learn that workers in hotels could avail of sick pay back in the early 2000s but they have no chance of doing so at the moment.  At that time, they could have a decent Sunday premium.  Some Sunday premiums now amount to 15 cent.  It used to be negotiated and agreed.<\/p> <p>These points are important in the context of ensuring people can make a decent living in the sector.  There is a wider context here.  The Bill is an important step forward.  Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges that and will work with the T&aacute;naiste but we need to address the elephant in the room.  Some 43% of low-paid workers work in hospitality, retail and wholesale.  We need to ensure a better future for them so that people can look forward to a career in those sectors.  That will not come about without proper engagement and negotiation.  It is regrettable but true that it is the hotel employers sector in particular that has resisted that.  I ask the Government to address that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#LL00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":140,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome to the House.  I pay tribute to the work of the One Galway and One Cork movement, which did a significant amount of campaigning and work to bring this issue to national attention.  I pay tribute also to the work of Senator Gavan and his colleagues who introduced the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill back in 2017.  When the campaign commenced then, I was struck by just how much of a chord it struck with so many people.  People were justifiably dismayed that an employer would ever deprive workers of the tips intended for staff.  In that context, I very much welcome the spirit of the legislation.  It says something that we need to have legislation such as this to clarify that tips clearly given for the benefit of workers actually are the property of workers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In welcoming the spirit of the legislation, we have to ask a number of questions as to why certain decisions were taken in drafting it.  This Bill has had the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but I wish to raise two concerns that have been touched upon, the first of which is the treatment of the service charge and the distinction between the definitions of \"mandatory\" and \"voluntary\".  As the T&aacute;naiste noted, the public would be horrified to know that service charges are not contained within the definition of a tip or gratuity.  For years, we have been duped into thinking we were paying something extra towards the service and not for the service itself.  This point raises the issue of the power of employers within the hospitality sector in particular in lobbying the Government to exclude service charges from this Bill.  In the 2017 Bill, service charges were to be recognised as part of a tip, but they are being excluded in this legislation.  I am taken by Dr. Deirdre Curran's suggestion that, if service charges are not to be included, they should be relabelled as an additional employer charge.  If this Bill is intent on bringing legal certainty for workers and transparency for customers, something needs to be done to highlight to customers that the service charge is just another item on the bill.  The T&aacute;naiste stated he was open to amendments.  We need to be clear on whether a service charge is something that goes to the employer or is intended for the worker without it being part of his or her taxable income, which is the crucial element.<\/p><p>My second concern has to do with the enforceability of this legislation.  Legislation is only as good as the enforcement procedures that are in place.  We were supportive of the original Bill's intent to make the withholding of a tip by an employer liable to criminal sanction.  Since that provision is also in place under the Payment of Wages Act 1991, I am unsure as to why the same standard does not apply in this amendment to that Act.<\/p><p>While I welcome the spirit of the Bill, we must be careful not to overstate the importance of a Bill like this.  Some Senators have spoken about the extent to which tips form part of the income a worker needs to cover his or her living costs or how they should be seen as something to help manage or mitigate the gender pay gap in workplaces.  Senator Garvey is right in that the workforce in certain parts of the hospitality and service sectors is predominantly female.  The key issue is the extent to which the Bill will address the gender pay gap and, as the T&aacute;naiste mentioned, help the tourism and hospitality sectors to be seen as valued and sustainable career choices.  While workers in the service sectors will appreciate the efforts being made in this Bill, the real question is what the Government is doing as regards their wages.  The confiscation of tips is insult added to the injury of low pay.  We need to hear the T&aacute;naiste's plans for improving pay and conditions in these sectors.  He has spoken about the five key plans as regards workers' rights, which is welcome, but if this Bill is the height of the Government's efforts, it will be exposed as tokenism and a failure to address the real injury, which is persistent and exploitative low pay in many parts of the hospitality sector.<\/p><p>It is striking that employers are complaining of labour shortages in many parts of the economy.  In one of the Sunday newspapers, there was a feature article with three hoteliers who talked about wanting to offer health insurance, yoga and other perks, yet only one of them spoke about wanting to improve pay.  That hotelier said the sector would be on a \"journey\" over the next number of years to try to bring its staff to a living wage.  We need to understand what a living wage is.  It is defined not as a decent standard of living but as the minimum essential standard of living.  For a hotelier with a five-star hotel to say the sector was going to take a number of years to get to that point says a great deal about the mentality of many employers within the hospitality sector.<\/p><p>As the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the T&aacute;naiste is in a unique position to bring employers and trade unions together.  Senator Gavan spoke about the collapse of the joint labour committees, JLCs, and the legislation to reinstate that system.  Interestingly, when the then Government commissioned a report from a former vice chairperson of the Labour Court to determine the appropriate sectors for a JLC, hospitality was identified as one.  Hospitality remains one of a number of sectors that still do not have a JLC because of the intransigence and blatant opposition of employers to engaging with workers and worker representatives in a fashion that can set out sustainable terms and conditions.  We want this sector to thrive and survive, but we also want to ensure workers can earn a decent standard of living.<\/p><p>I welcome the spirit of the Bill but there is much more we must hear from the T&aacute;naiste about his plans in respect of low pay.  On average, a hospitality worker earns 47% of the average wage.<\/p><p>Culturally, not everyone in this country pays tips.  In the United States, it is part and parcel of what people pay when they go to a caf&eacute; or restaurant, but that is not the case in this country, so we must be careful not to overstate the importance of tips as a part of people's income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#LL00300","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#MM00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste.  I am pleased to see this legislation being debated in the Chamber.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and his Department for their work on this matter.  I commend Senator Gavan, who introduced the National Minimum Wage (Protection of Employee Tips) Bill 2017.  It laid the groundwork for the Government's legislation.<\/p><p>The restaurant industry and the wider hospitality sector have undoubtedly had a challenging time over the past couple of years.  We saw unprecedented levels of unemployment in the sector, with a large number of people choosing to leave it and the closure of many small independent businesses.  Despite the continued concern about the pandemic, it has been a relief to see our hospitality industry doing what it does best over the past fortnight.  I wish it every success in the early days of the reopening of society.<\/p><p>We sometimes take for granted how important it is to contemporary life in Ireland to be able to sit down in a caf&eacute;, bar or restaurant.  The industry provides much more to us than just food or drink.  It is a space for community, conversation, relaxation and the stimulation of all of our senses.  It provides us with a warm welcome and a space to celebrate life events with friends and family or to sit in a quiet corner and enjoy our own company.  It also provides something significant to those it employs, something that is beyond a person's take-home payment.<\/p><p>There is a passage by the late Anthony Bourdain that encapsulates some of the importance of what hospitality provides to us all, not least those working in the industry.  I hope it is okay to take the time to quote it.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tYou can always tell when a person has worked in a restaurant.  There's an empathy ... a special understanding of the way a bunch of motley misfits can be a family.  Service industry work develops the &quot;soft skills&quot; recruiters talk about on LinkedIn - discipline, promptness, the ability to absorb criticism, and most important, how to read people like a book.  The work is thankless and fun and messy, and the world would be a kinder place if more people tried it.  With all due respect to my former professors, I've long believed I gained more knowledge in kitchens, bars, and dining rooms than any college could even hold. <\/blockquote> <p><!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That really stood out to me because I too worked in the hospitality industry when I was a young single mother.  It was a very vibrant job to have.  Many of us will have a new-found appreciation for the hospitality industry following this pandemic.  Appreciation, however, does not pay the bills.  Unfortunately, the industry is not always fairly compensated for the contribution it makes to contemporary life.  Many jobs in the service industry can be quite precarious and often they are not well paid.  The hours can be very taxing and unsociable and are not well suited to parents or people in education or training or for those with caring responsibilities.  We need to start attributing more value to the work of the industry and those employed in it.<\/p><p>Obviously, this Bill cannot address all of the insecurities to which I have just referred.  I hope it will provide a little bit more security for employees and customers about tips and gratuities, how they are regulated and where they end up.  While we need to ensure the basic pay for people employed in the sector is decent, tips and gratuities will continue to be an important addition to the gross income of those employed in the sector.  There need to be robust protections in place.  It should never be the case that there is uncertainty about where tips end up or how they are divided between the staff team at a caf&eacute; or a restaurant.  It should absolutely never be the case that tips received by staff are used to cover their basic wage costs, as has been common practice in a number of high-profile venues in recent years.  Tips are given in good faith by customers with the understanding that the tip is distributed to the staff team.  That any business leader would mislead his or her customers and mistreat the staff in this way is very disappointing.  I welcome the protections the Bill will provide in these circumstances.<\/p><p>I may be confused about this but I am disappointed the legislation does not protect cash tips in the same way as those paid by card.  It seems nonsensical to enact this legislation and then to exclude a large portion of tips and gratuities by virtue of how they are paid.  The employee has no say in the matter of how the payment is processed.  A person who decides to pay with cash should not be disincentivised from doing so.  We are living in an increasingly cashless society, but both cash and card payments should be treated the same in the context of this legislation.<\/p><p>I would like to see the legislation include more robust guidelines for service charges that are applied automatically to a bill at the end of a meal.  Many people, when they go to a caf&eacute; or restaurant, believe they are paying a tip when a mandatory service charge is applied.  While I appreciate the Bill stipulates that businesses must display their policy and practice in respect of service charges, surely it still misleads paying customers to suggest that the advertised price of the meal does not match their bill at the end.<\/p><p>Additionally in my reading of the Bill, it does not stipulate that policies around optional service charges ought to be displayed in a transparent way by a business.  Many service charges are levied at the discretion of the bill payer.  Again, people perceive the payment of a discretionary service charge as being the equivalent of leaving a tip for a staff team.  While many businesses do distribute the takings for service charges to their employees, we should not give space for an anomaly to exist in this way between those businesses that apply mandatory charges over discretionary service charges.<\/p><p>I reiterate my broad support for this Bill and its contents, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the weeks ahead in the House to make the legislation as strong as it can be for the customers and employees of the service and hospitality industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#MM00300","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome to the Seanad.

It gives workers legal protection over tips.  This means the tips received cannot be counted towards an employee's basic pay and the tips must be additional and separate.

Some of those have featured in the media in the past for not having fair policies.

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's and Fine Gael's commitment to protecting workers' rights here.  As the T&aacute;naiste has mentioned, this is one of five rights the Government is bringing forward this year.

It is crucial, especially in regional areas like Roscommon and east Galway.  We have spoken about this recently.

This legislation means employers will have to pass on tips to employees, and this applies in all sectors, including hospitality, taxi drivers, hairdressers and tour guides.

Other areas that can be examined and reformed, and this Bill is the start.  The Bill will ensure transparency for all employees, in particular in terms of electronic payments, and will oblige an employer to publish a statement for all employees to view.  That is extremely welcome.<\/p><p>On service charges, is there a way for it to be made clear on a bill that this is an employers' service charge?  Can such a provision be included in the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#NN00300","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House, and I welcome the Bill.  However, as somebody who has lived his life in the hospitality sector I am disappointed that we have to introduce a piece of legislation for the distribution of what is surely the entitlement of staff to their tips.  I am disappointed that it has come to that.  A minority of businesses are not distributing tips properly.  A majority of us put our staff front and centre because we are a service industry.  Without staff, the hospitality sector does not have an industry.  Staff are the one key component we need to survive now and into the future, and we must look after them.  In my lifetime, I have never at any stage not distributed tips for staff to them.<\/p> <p>A lot has been said.  Senator Gavan mentioned the JLC.  I will speak about my experience of the JLC.  Sadly, my father passed away very suddenly and I had to take over our hotel long before I had ever intended to do so.  I relied on the JLC.  It gave me a framework within which to structure my pay and conditions for staff.  I have engaged with the JLC process.  Senator Gavan is right in that it provided staff with a structured four-year process whereby they would get a pay increase on an annual basis.  The JLC also differentiated between tipping and non-tipping zones, and took account of the fact that while tips are given out at the front the staff at the back might not necessarily get them.  There was a compensation factor there.  At that time, there was a differentiation between male and female wages, which when we think about it was disgraceful.  <\/p> <p>As the industry struggles and tries to reopen, we have seen a wholesale exodus of the key core element of the sector, namely staff, pay and conditions will become a vital part of how we try to revitalise our industry.  There is a significant labour shortage.  We are back to almost 100% employment and we are struggling to get applications for jobs requiring specific skills in the industry.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to immediately examine the work permit and visa process.<\/p> <p>Service charges have been mentioned.  I have never used them and have never seen the need to.  At one stage in the 1990s, there were two service charges in some hotels in Dublin.  There was a service charge and then a basic service charge, BSC, which added between 12.5% and 15% to a bill.  I welcome the clarity that even when a service charge is operated, businesses have to display how it is distributed or broken down.  If nothing else, the Bill is doing that.<\/p> <p>The distribution of tips in the industry is a minefield.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Cash has been mentioned, and I could give the House examples of schemes and processes that have been put in place.  We have all left tips under saucers or given them to people behind the counter or staff walking out the door.  From an employer point of view, trying to control that is almost impossible.  <\/p> <p>As an employer, I would love everything to be electronic.  I could then physically control how money is distributed.  We spent six months in our hotel trying to come up with a scheme that was more transparent and ensured everybody, down to kitchen porters and housemaids, got tips.  Tips were proportionate across all staff and were distributed with wages on a weekly basis.  By week six of that process, the pool of money had almost disappeared.  We went back to the previous situation with cash whereby whoever got cash took it.  Dealing with cash is complex, and the T&aacute;naiste referred to that.  There is a track record with electronic payments and businesses can manage that process.<\/p> <p>The role of Revenue in respect of tips could come back to haunt us down the road.  What does the T&aacute;naiste think that role should be?  There are electronic records to establish what tips were collected and to whom they have been distributed.  We all know that in America the rate is almost 15%.  My brother operates a hotel in Washington and has told me that staff never collect their wages because it is used to pay the tax on the tips they receive.  We need to know what the understanding of employers will be in respect of tips collected and whether staff will have to pay tax on that money.  Staff are entitled to know that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#OO00200","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for bringing this Bill forward.  When I saw it I was delighted.  I am married to someone who was a representative in the hotel branch of the ITGWU some years ago.  When we were dating, there were establishments he would not go to because they used tips to pay wages.  The reputational damage that is attached to some establishments in this city is well warranted, and long may they endure that until they prove otherwise and show transparency with regard to their staff.<\/p> <p>Tips should never be used to supplement wages.  Staff should receive them for exceptional service.  While it is not compulsory to pay tips in Ireland, it is a mark of the sheer hard work, special occasion and attendance given by an individual which is warranted.  It is a human kindness that is worth more than its monetary value in terms of the value to an individual.  <\/p> <p>Given the staff shortages in the hospitality sector, this Bill is urgent.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We should consider including in the guidelines the requirement to advertise the tips and gratuities policy.  There should be a clear definition of \"service charge\" within that policy as to how a service charge is distributed, if it is distributed.  There was an agreement back in the 1950s to increase staff wages using service charges; that was its origins.  However, it may have moved on from that and many employers do not use it accordingly.  I am glad to see a criminal sanction element.  Depending on the type of employer, it will be more or less effective.  I am thinking of sole traders.  That would be one thing on which we need a little bit of consideration.  The fact it is a mandatory policy will lead to conversations with smaller employers and will bring out into the open how tips are dealt with, which is also a good thing.<\/p><p>There is an element in the legislation providing for how we deal with contractors.  That is fine.  We have a trend coming into hospitality where staff can be provided from a platform working environment.  I have come across that.  Many employees in hospitality are also temporary agency workers.  Some of them are beyond retirement age and therefore do not have the protections of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  They rely on the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act, and within that they have a right to claim commensurate benefits.  The definition within that Act is \"basic pay and conditions\".  Certain bonuses have not been included in that while others have.  For the purposes of Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, referrals we need to give clear guidance on whether this Bill comes into that definition of basic pay and conditions for temporary agency workers.  I believe it should.  That is a little tweak that perhaps we should consider at some point.  It will work its way out anyway, to be fair, as the WRC engages with the Bill and its outworking.<\/p><p>There was a genuine fear of taxation so I am glad that is clearly defined.  There are workers in the industry who talk about going into work with nothing in their pocket and having their few bob going home, so that is welcome.  Overall I support the Bill.  The temporary agency worker element is important to look at.  Otherwise it is very fine legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#OO00300","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate.  I commend Senator Gavan who really drove this issue in the previous session.  Through his work and the work of the trade unions, focus was brought to bear on the hospitality sector, particularly those rogue employers who were withholding tips from employees.  There is a need for a broader conversation about what needs to happen and how we have arrived at a point where employees are reliant on tips due to low pay and conditions in the hospitality sector.  As others have said, there was a time when tips were a bonus and a way to acknowledge staff who went above and beyond.  Unfortunately, in Ireland now, tips are becoming an essential part of workers' salaries.  The fluctuation from week to week and month to month is only adding to the precarious nature of the sector and to the stress of the workers.  This sector is especially characterised by its young workforce, predominantly female and with a significant number of migrant workers.<\/p> <p>It is fair to say we all know there are many excellent employers in the hospitality sector.  I worked for one myself on and off in a caf&eacute; on George's Street for years and it put me through college.  It was also there for me to fall back on when the crash happened and I lost my job that I had studied for in college.  There, the staff had full control over tips.  The only role the owner of the business had was at the end of the month to change all the coins that were collected into notes for the staff.  I compare that to the more recent experience of somebody who works in my office, which was very different.  Their wages were stopped for breakages.  They had repeatedly to request the money that was owed to them when they finished working there.  Luckily, they kept all the evidence in writing.<\/p> <p>We have seen that the restaurants and hospitality lobby has been very vocal.  It is very strong and forthright in saying what it wants and it was given lots of airtime, particularly during the pandemic.  Too often it is the workers' voices that are not heard. There is some imbalance in this Bill.  Maybe that is because we need to hear more from the employees and less so from the employers.  That is not to discount the very welcome provisions of the Bill as outlined by others here.  There are improvements that need to be made and I hope we can do that through amendments.<\/p> <p>One particular concern is the difference in treatment of cash and card payments.  I hope that can be resolved.  Initially, payment by card was seen as the higher risk for people who working in the sector.  Certainly as someone who has worked in it, when paying by card I always ask if the staff get the tip if it is put on the card or if it goes to the employer.  We cannot now have a situation where, if they are getting a cash tip, they are going to lose the protection.  That needs to be fixed.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Bill will make it compulsory for customers to be notified of the policy of the establishment.  It is important that the public vote with their feet when we hear about people who do not treat their workers right.  I commend the campaign by the trade unions and the USI that highlighted the practices in the Ivy.  It is concerning that mandatory service charges can still be imposed and used as an income by the employer.  Not only does that lead to confusion for customers about what they are paying, it also reduces the amount of money they have available to leave a tip so that the workers more than likely will lose out.<\/p> <p>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  I commend Senator Gavan on getting the ball rolling on this.  The present Bill is a welcome next step.  I hope the Minister and the Government will work with the Opposition on amendments to achieve what we have heard everybody flagging.  There are genuine concerns but most people welcome the fact the Bill is coming forward.  Once we get that right we can move on to the more important work of ensuring those in the hospitality sector earn a living wage and have secure working conditions so they can see the sector as a rewarding career choice.  The best way to address staff shortages in the sector is to make it a viable career choice for people.  We will only do that when we have respect for those who work in hospitality and pay them a living wage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#PP00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I am not going to take up all of my time.  There is no point repeating a lot that has been said already.  This is good legislation.  It is part of what the Government is doing on workers' rights.  The public is way ahead of us on this.  Most people make a serious effort when they are in a restaurant to make sure the staff get their tips.  One of the problems that has arisen is that while we are moving more into being a cashless society, people are a bit slow to get the tip added on to their card.  It is only beginning to happen now.  I have a bit of experience with this.  One of our children is still in college and has a holiday job.  One has just moved out of that.  They noticed that the more it went over to card, the fewer tips they got, but it is beginning to improve now.  The vast majority of people who own restaurants or manage hotels are ensuring nowadays the workers get their tips.  I am hearing my own children say this nowadays.  They say that usually the person on the floor who is in charge is left in charge of the tips, not the owner.  The owners in many respects make that decision.<\/p> <p>Some very valid points have been made.  Everyone in this Chamber wants to ensure people get their tips.  I have a massive issue about people not getting their tips.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=01\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not think we should be painting a picture that we have a massive problem with this nowadays, because we do not.  Nevertheless, I acknowledge that where there are shortcomings and where people do not pass on these tips, we need the legislation and we need to deal with it.  It is a good Bill.  I welcome the fact that Adrian Cummins, head of the Restaurants Association of Ireland has welcomed it and that restaurants will engage and make sure that the practice is carried out in restaurants.  I know that most of the restaurants and hotels in my area are treating their staff properly.  I agree that it was a different story some years back.  I used to get a lot more complaints about this issue ten or 12 years ago, but I am glad to say it is not as big a problem now.  By having the statutory element in place, workers will be protected.  It is the right way to do business.  This has been a very good engagement today and I thank the T&aacute;naiste for being here.

I think Senator Casey raised a very valid point on the question of how Revenue is going to deal with this issue.  This Bill is about ensuring tips are not part of staff's wages.  The point Senator Casey made is that tips will be part of their wages.  Perhaps that is the way Revenue is going to treat it.  More than likely, Revenue will stay silent or play dumb for a while on the matter.  However, it is a very important question because it could well be that what we are legislating for here today is that tips will be part of the wages of the staff in the hospitality sector.  There will be many problems implementing this legislation and adhering to the many guidelines and whatever will be attached to the Bill when it is fully implemented.<\/p> <p>I recently spoke to Marvin Baker, who is the CEO of Lightspeed, a sustainability business.  Through one of the company's initiatives, restaurant customers can choose to make a donation to offset their carbon footprint and fruit trees will be planted in the developing world.  They are fruit trees that will provide food for the people and work in areas where work is badly needed.  Through this legislation, we could be well down the road towards a situation where there could be confusion when a client in a restaurant gets the bill, wants to pay a tip and wants to offset some of their carbon footprint.  For example, Mr. Baker told me that in the past he found that some of the contributions went missing and he did not get the number of trees that he was supposed to get in a particular month.   What happens if that is the case with this legislation?  It is going to be a big problem for restaurants, hotels and businesses to keep track of everything, whether it is a tip or a contribution to offset the carbon footprint.  The restaurateur might decide that they do not want to introduce a tips or carbon-offsetting policy for their business.  They may decide that it is up to customers to decide whether they want to leave a cash tip on the table.  Will such an approach be acceptable under this legislation?  Will it be acceptable for a proprietor of a restaurant or an hotel to operate in that fashion when they think there is too much work involved in the other way, with too much infighting and too many problems?  They may choose to operate a policy with no tips or carbon offsetting.  They may decide that it is up to the customer to decide whether they want to leave a tip on the table or contribute to offsetting their carbon footprint, and whatever happens after that it is not the restaurateur's responsibility.<\/p> <p>As Senator Murphy said, I wonder how widespread the discrimination in the existing policy was.  I was in the hospitality business for quite a number of years and I never heard any complaints, to be quite honest.  I also did not hear of any restaurants that were not returning their tips to the staff.  There is no doubt about it that there will be problems implementing some aspects of this Bill.  For example, what happens if a hotel has a policy of returning tips to staff, a customer decides to leave &euro;20 or &euro;30 on the table and the person coming in to clean the room sticks the &euro;30 into their own pocket?  Are they going to be prosecuted?  Where does it leave situations like that, when a member of staff does not return the tip that was left and there is a tips policy in place that all tips should be returned?  I see from the second page of the explanatory memorandum that consideration will be given to the seniority or experience of the employee, whether they are on a full-time or part-time contract, whether the employee was consulted in relation to the manner of distribution and the role and influence of the employee in providing a service.  There will be quite a number of problems in developing the policy that is going to be adhered to, if there is a policy to be adhered to.  Perhaps some of those issues can be teased out on Committee Stage.  I welcome the legislation.  I think it is quite right that all tips should be returned and given to employees.  That is who they are meant for and that is who should get them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#QQ00200","speaker":"1636"},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House this afternoon and thank him for coming to discuss this important issue.  I wish to pay compliment both Senator Doherty, who brought the Bill forward when she was Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and other colleagues who have done a lot of work in relation to the Bill.  I know that the T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is very committed to improving the lives of workers.  I welcome the fact that this legislation is before us here today.<\/p> <p>I have been talking and chatting to people and employees working in restaurants.  The majority of people I have spoken to are very happy with the set-up within their own places of employment.  Certainly, I have found that workers are in receipt of their tips, and in most places, the pot of money is divided among the employees working on a particular night.  However, I understand that there are workers who are not in receipt of their tips.  Therefore, I think it is very important that this legislation is brought forward.<\/p> <p>On the point raised by Senator Casey about the way Revenue will treat electronic tipping, I believe that tips are taxed in the USA and other countries.  I would not like to see us going down that route because I believe that when customers give an employee a tip, they give it in good faith for the services they have received.  I know that in some places there are service charges and it was thought that a portion of such charges would go towards tips, but not every place has service charges.  I suppose it does not affect businesses.  I am aware that in some places, when customers are paying by card, an option comes up on the card machine offering them the option to leave a tip.  I do not know if that could be introduced right across all card machines or whether it would be a big piece of work.  I am sure the machines are programmed by banks when they are provided to the businesses for their use.  You see it in some places.  It is possibly a reminder for the person who is paying the bill that there is the option to leave a tip.  However, I think most people go with the old-fashioned model of leaving the money.  During Covid, not all of us had cash in our pockets, so many people moved to the use of cards.<\/p> <p>I want to compliment the T&aacute;naiste on his work in bringing forward this legislation.  I fully support it.  I think it is very important that we support the rights of the worker.  I wish to compliment the T&aacute;naiste and the Department on all the work that has been done, because times have been very challenging with both Covid and Brexit.

I thought we would do just two things: make it illegal to use tips to top up wages, bearing in mind that it is already illegal to top up to the minimum wage but not to other contractual rates, and introduce transparency around tips and service charges to make sure they go to the staff and so people will know how they are divvied up.  Most people do not know how much goes to the server and how much to the people in the kitchen and so on.  I thought it would be that simple but it is not.  As is always the case when one tries to legislate, one discovers all the various nuances.  One discovers that there are sometimes areas that are best not to legislate for because one can do more harm than good.<br\/><br\/>Cash tips are generally, but not always, controlled by the staff and do not go through the books.  Electronic tips are paid when somebody pays the bill electronically.  These, by definition, go through the books.  There are now apps, such as TiPJAR and Strikepay, that can be used to pay electronically to a server a tip that does not go through the employer's books.  It is a bit like giving somebody money with Revolut.  I came across these apps only in the past couple of weeks.  There are mandatory service charges and discretionary service charges.  While they sound similar, they are very different.  A discretionary service charge involves a choice whereas a mandatory one gives no choice.  The matter is more complicated than I believed it would be.  My sense, and the sense I have heard from Senators this evening, is that we have to strengthen the Bill regarding service charges so it will be clear they are for staff and not additional income for the business.  I will return to that a little later.<br\/><br\/>On Senator Doherty's remarks on the proposed section 4B, we will determine whether we can change the wording so the employer must consult the employees or secure their consent.  However, we will have to think about what happens when that is not possible, particularly where there may be a transient or unorganised workforce in a certain business.<br\/><br\/>On Senator Garvey's questions on the Low Pay Commission report, I have asked the commission to advise the Government on how we would move towards a living wage for Ireland.  There are several decisions that will have to be made when I receive the report.  I have not got it yet.  We are supposed to get it in quarter 2 or in the next couple of months.  We may get it at the end of quarter 1, but certainly in quarter 2.  A couple of big decisions will have to be made, including on how the wage is calculated, whom it applies to and how it should be phased in.<br\/><br\/>There is a programme for Government commitment to move towards a living wage for Ireland and to get it done during the course of this Government.  I guess that is the sixth workers' right.  The seventh is auto-enrolment, in respect of which the objective is to ensure workers in the private sector who do not have an occupational pension have access to one.  Half of them do not.  If we secure these seven rights in the term of this Government, we will not have done a bad job, but I am not committing to securing rights six and seven this year.  I am committing to the first five this year and to the sixth and seventh over the course of the term of the Government.<br\/><br\/>On Senator Garvey's suggestion to have an information campaign, we will absolutely have to act on that.  We will have to run the campaign in different languages and work with various stakeholders to get the information out about the new law, if and when it is enacted.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gavan was asking about cash tips and transparency regarding them.  We will consider this.  The advice from the Workplace Relations Commission is that regulating and managing cash tips just would not be workable.  Generally speaking, but not always, they are managed by the staff.  If there were a right to redress, who would one be seeking it from?  It would presumably be from another staff member.  It would be new, in my view, for somebody to take a case on tips, with one staff member against another going to the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is not something I am ruling out but something we will have to consider.  It is complicated.  By the nature of the fact that cash is involved, there would not be any evidential trail unless somebody, somehow, had video evidence or there was sworn testimony.  Cash tips are very complicated to regulate for, and that is why the Workplace Relations Commission recommended we not do so.  However, we will give it some thought and consider amendments if there are any.<br\/><br\/>On discretionary service charges, Senator Gavan is correct in that they are considered to be tips and gratuities.  On mandatory service charges, the view of everyone in this House is that they comprise money that should go to the staff.  Most people believe they do but they do not always.  That is a problem, so it is a question of whether we can strengthen the legislation on Committee Stage to make it clear that a mandatory service charge should go to the staff.  Potentially, there should not be mandatory service charges at all.  A service charge is a funny thing, is it not?  Most of the time when you receive a service, you pay and there is not 10% on top.  In other service industries, such as the hair and beauty industry, I have never come across a service charge.  Maybe it happens.  It does not in the barbershop, anyway.  There are two options: to outlaw mandatory service charges altogether or to be very clear that the money must go to the staff.<br\/><br\/>I was fascinated to hear about the origin of service charges.  I was not aware of it.  It is an interesting piece of Irish labour history that I did not know.  I do know about the tronc, however.  The term comes from France, where, originally, there was a <i>tronc<\/i>, or alms box, at the back of a church.  Very clearly, a gift is implied.<br\/><br\/>Work permits comprise a big problem at the moment.  I am sure all the Senators' offices are getting many queries about them.  I certainly am.  There is now a backlog of approximately 19 or 20 weeks in processing work permits in the Department.  There is a reason: employers are struggling to get staff, not just in Ireland but also in the rest of the European Union.  The number of work permit applications is up 70% on this time last year.  That is a distortion because last year was a year of the pandemic, but even compared with 2019, before the pandemic, the figure is up by about 50%.  Therefore, there is a huge demand to bring people from outside the European Economic Area to Ireland to work.  Since we have made work permits possible for many more categories, including in construction and agriculture, there has been a big increase in demand.  The number of staff processing work permits has increased from 19 to 55, but many of them have not done it before and are learning about it for the first time.  It will take a couple of months before we can improve the situation, but we are monitoring it weekly.<br\/><br\/>Senator Burke asked a very good question: could an employer have a no-tips policy?  That is not saying there should not be any tips but that it is not his or her business.  I believe the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; but I will check.  Whether an employer could just say he or she does not get involved with tips and that they are a matter for the staff is a good question that we need to check out.  In that scenario, the tips would have to be cash only or paid through Strikepay or TiPJAR.  Once the money is paid electronically, it does become the employer's business, and that is where it gets complicated.  The world is probably a lot easier when there are cash tips only.  It has been complicated by electronic payments.<br\/><br\/>The legislation does not alter the tax treatment of tips in any way.  That is a matter for the Finance Acts.  I have deliberately not addressed the matter in this legislation because any change to tax treatment would have to be achieved through the Finance Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022020100002#QQ00500","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643725800,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.
