Obviously, given that he is blind his does not see pictures.  Part of the Irish oral exam is to describe pictures as Gaeilge.  For a blind person to be asked in any circumstances to describe pictures in any language is not acceptable, but it is completely unacceptable for this to happen in a State examination situation.<\/p> <p>I have been in touch with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland to try to get a handle on exactly how and why this is happening.  It would appear that there is no consistency around the country.  In some areas, special provision is made and a commonsense approach is adopted, but in other situations the rules are rigidly stuck to.  That is not acceptable.  We need the system to be consistent.  We need to have a little bit of respect for a young person who cannot see what he or she is doing.  <\/p> <p>There is a much bigger question in terms of access to the leaving certificate, which I have spoken about before.

The RACE scheme allows relevant students to engage with the standard examination arrangements and to demonstrate what they know and what they can do in a way that does not compromise the integrity of the assessment.  The focus of the scheme is on the need to remove examination access barriers while retaining the need to assess the same underlying skills and competencies, and to apply the same standards of achievement as apply to all other students.<\/p><p>An extensive range of examination supports is available through the RACE scheme to support candidates with visual impairments in taking their examinations.  The SEC works very closely with the visiting teacher service of the National Council for Special Education in this regard.  In the oral examinations for modern foreign languages and the Irish language, the provision for enlarged pictures sequences or role play cards will be provided to candidates who have been granted the accommodation of an enlarged examination paper under the scheme.  The use of visual aides, magnifier or reading lamps can also be used if required.<\/p><p>In considering the possible accommodations for the oral Irish examination with regard to picture sequences, it is necessary to consider the demands of this aspect of the examination on all candidates.  The oral examination is worth 40% of the overall marks available for this subject, with the picture sequences worth 80 marks out of the 240 available for the oral examination.  Typically, candidates taking the oral Irish examination are expected to be familiar with 20 picture sequences but in 2022, to alleviate the burden on candidates due to Covid-19, this has been reduced to ten.  Each picture sequence is an A4 page with a series of six pictures that present a particular story.  Candidates have access to the picture sequences from the beginning of fifth year.  Candidates choose at random one of the picture sequences and are expected to provide an account in Irish about the series of pictures.  The candidate's ability will be assessed on both the descriptive narration and the interaction between the candidate and the examiner.<\/p><p>In recent years, in engagement with the visiting teacher service, the accommodation provided for candidates with visual impairments is to replace the picture sequences with a narrative description of what is happening in each of the storyboards presented in English.  The picture sequences of the Irish oral examinations are assessing a core skill and so candidates may not be exempted from this element of the examination.  The provision of the English language storyboards for students with visual impairments upholds a fundamental principle of the RACE scheme, which is that any alternative assessment provided must assess the same construct as the original test item and must not compromise the purpose of the examination.<\/p><p>I will bring the two issues raised by the Senator to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, specifically in terms of the variation from area to area and also the digital component.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#A00900","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank the Minister of State for his observations with regard to my <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>article at the weekend.

I am looking for an update in regard to a primary school in my part of the world.  Summercove national school is a wonderful school that has such potential but it has literally been at the bottom of the list for the past 20 years.  We have been trying to make sure that it can get the appropriate new build that it has been seeking for more than 20 years.  Kinsale is a wonderful town that has seen massive development, particularly on the educational front, and there is now the community school and the Gaelscoil, and another primary school is being built at the moment on the road towards Ballinspittle.  However, Summercove national school has been somewhat left behind.  The population of Kinsale is projected to increase by one third in the next few years in the county development plan and will go to an amazing 7,500 people.  The need for the school to be redeveloped is urgent.<\/p> <p>I have continuously raised this issue.  Last year, I got an update from the Minister on 13 June stating that the Department would be finalising the accommodation brief for the project.  We have seen very little movement on it since then and, therefore, I am looking for clarification as to where is the brief and where are the proposed timelines that we can put in place for the people of Kinsale regarding this important structure.<\/p> <p>It is quite a small school in many ways.  It has eight mainstream classrooms and three special education rooms.  The newly appointed principal, Ms Hallissey, is doing a fantastic job and there is a powerful board behind this proposal.  However, they have waited nearly two generations.  I spoke to people at the weekend whose children have gone through the education system while they have been waiting for this new build to happen; not alone did they start primary but they finished secondary in that time.  That is a damning indictment of where this project has been for the past 20 years.  We need political and ministerial leverage to make sure we can deliver this project going forward.  As I stated, Kinsale is a thriving town and this school is a very important part of it.  We need to make sure we can develop both together.  The Minister of State might give us an indication of the timelines, when the Department proposes that the finalised brief will be published and when it is proposed we will see boots on the ground and development starting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#B00400","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue on behalf of his community and Summercove national school in Kinsale.

The brief for this project is the development of a single-storey, eight-classroom primary school with two classrooms for pupils with special educational needs at Summercove national school, including a new building and all associated site works.  This major building project will be delivered under the Department&rsquo;s ADAPT programme, which uses the services of a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe to progress the project through the stages of architectural planning.  The tender process to appoint a project manager is nearing completion.

The Minister of State&rsquo;s role in ensuring action was taken on foot of the Moorhead report to address the terms of conditions for councillors needs to be acknowledged.  The Minister of State provided great leadership in that regard and I know he continues to work closely with the representative bodies, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, in trying to ensure that the role of councillors is recognised and in making sure that their terms and conditions are improved.  The implementation of the new regime, though, has resulted in a number of problems, particularly around the area of vouched expenses, where different rules or interpretations seem to be applied by the different local authorities.<\/p> <p>Councillors are looking for consistency in the application of those expenses, so that when they submit applications for expenses, they will know that no matter where they are located in the country, the same rules will apply.  A problem has arisen, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware, with regard to the chairs of the strategic policy committees, SPCs.  That allowance has now been interpreted as a taxable form of income.  This means that even though some councillors were financially better off as a result of the increase in the councillor&rsquo;s salary, the net effect is that because their SPC allowance is now taxed, they may not be better off as a result of that change.<\/p> <p>I would also ask the Minister of State to look at some of the questions around the travel bands.  Obviously, the cost of travel has increased significantly and there are some issues around the levels given for travel expenses, depending on where within a county an individual councillor may be located.<\/p> <p>Finally, there is, and I would appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this, some concern around the gratuity payments that have been made.  There has been a reduction from 100% of final salary to 75% of final salary.  Indeed, that will impact on a number of us in this House, whenever we decide to leave politics.  I know much of the focus of the Moorhead report was around the terms of conditions, but part of the recommendations were about the devolution of more powers to local authorities.  This would give councillors greater responsibility and more time and support in dealing with issues around governance and around policy development.<\/p> <p>We know how hard the 949 councillors around the country work.  All of us who are in this Chamber now would have come from that background, as have many others in these Houses.  One of our challenges has been around juggling time.  Frequently, local government in Ireland feels powerless.  In fact, we still do not have local government.  We continue to have local administration.<\/p> <p>I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s plans to look at devolving more powers and supports to local authorities.  It is key that we look at encouraging - I know the Minister of State is doing this - a broader range of people into local government from as diverse a range of backgrounds as possible.  The Minister of State is actively encouraging more female members and more people from minority backgrounds to come on board.<\/p> <p>There is a general concern that applies across Government, and in the Minister of State&rsquo;s capacity I would ask him to look at this, which is the habit in legislation to exclude councillors from appointment to State boards.  It makes sense why Members of the Oireachtas are excluded, because we have a role in the setting of the legislation, and so on.  We frequently deal with State boards.  Even though it is an open application process, all things being equal, just because somebody is a councillor, they should not be excluded from a State board.  This is particularly the case when we are trying to encourage as many people as possible to become involved in local authority.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister of State on his work, and I am very grateful that he continues to work closely with the AILG and LAMA.  However, I would hope that he would be able to provide us with a response to some of those issues, as well as how he is enhancing the role of local councillors generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#C00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising these important matters on the implementation of the Moorhead report and the issues of the devolving local powers down to local government.<\/p> <p>On 1 July 2021, new regulations came into effect to reform the framework of financial supports for councillors to allow them to continue to carry out their statutory functions and community representational role in an effective and sustainable manner.  This gave effect to an important commitment in the programme for Government to implement the findings of the Moorhead report within 12 months.  One of the main recommendations of the Moorhead report was that there should be a rebalancing of financial supports for councillors away from tax-free expenses allowances in favour of more normalised salaried income, as applies to other types of office holders.  The new regulations that I, along with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, gave effect to provided for: the introduction of an annual remuneration payment that, since 1 February 2022, is worth &euro;26,415 per annum; and the introduction of a new vouched local representation allowance worth up to a maximum of &euro;5,160 per annum, with similar terms to the vouched public representation allowance that is available to Oireachtas Members.<\/p> <p>The Senator has referenced two issues in terms of the calculation of the expenses.  I met with both the AILG and with LAMA in response to that and we will resolve that issue.  Across the 31 local authorities we do need clarity.  My view, as Minister of State, is that I want to support local authority members in every way, so that they can discharge their functions to their communities.  I do not want to make it any more difficult.  We will therefore work to resolve that and I am confident that we will do so.  <\/p> <p>In relation to the SPC chairperson, in the first instance, when terms and conditions are reviewed by the Government, they have to be set to the Revenue Commissioners for approval.  That is part of the rules and regulations, and unfortunately, the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners notified us that they had decided or made the determination that SPC chairperson allowances were to be taxed.  There were some negotiations and they decided to do it from 1 January.  They had looked to do it earlier on prior to that.  Unfortunately, however, this is an argument that we did not win.  I have to be quite and frank and honest about it.  Unfortunately, it is beyond my control.  They are independent in the performance of their functions and they made that determination.<\/p> <p>In relation to travel bands, essentially, the key issue here is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as I understand, are reviewing the calculation for milage and expenses across the whole Civil Service.  That will obviously apply directly to local authority members.  Therefore, that is out of my remit and it is part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Once it has its review done, that calculation will come back, and we will be advised of it through a Government decision.<\/p> <p>In relation to gratuity, which is another significant issue, the Moorhead report was clear that in the first instance local authority gratuities or pension calculations work in line with the normal public service rules and they were looking to increase it up the normal 66 age retirement.  Second, the report raised issues about the funding of the local authority pensions.  In response to that, I have set up a group to have a look at bringing in local authority members to the Department to see if we can get a resolution.  However, I want to be honest about this, which is to say that I am not promising anything with regard to that.  This is because it is difficult in terms of the funding mechanism, as well as the fact that they will get payment when they are 55.  Yet, I think that the change in the PRSI class S will assist local authorities.  Subsequent to that, it is going to be difficult.  However, I have put the process in place to try to resolve it and to address the concerns that many of the local authority members have brought to me, like Senator Malcolm Byrne has done.  Hopefully, we will do that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We also have our action plan to tackle other areas such as maternity and paternity leave.

A great deal of work and reform is under way in that regard.  In a wider reform perspective, we have the property tax review, which will be key to local authorities retaining their funding.  I refer as well to the directly elected mayor of Limerick, which is another exciting proposal bringing devolved government back closer to citizens.

We again see an effort there to insert a provision to exclude from consideration for appointment to the board someone who is, or becomes, a member of a local authority.  I am not asking for political appointments to boards, but if someone goes through the Public Appointments Service, and all else is equal, then that person should not be excluded from consideration because he or she is a councillor.  Many councillors have a great deal of experience in areas other than local government and they should be entitled to be considered for appointment to State boards.  This seems, however, to be a cross-Government policy.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State to lead on this issue and to try to prevent this policy from forming part of future legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#D00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for his kind comments.

Recently published reports I have seen indicate we need approximately 50,000 homes to be built every year for the next 30 years.  That information was published before we welcomed thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the war in their country to our shores.  Trying to find homes for our young people is clearly the number one social crisis we face.  Thankfully, we are beginning to make progress on this issue, despite the obstacles posed by Covid-19 and many other factors.  I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the work they are doing in this regard.<\/p> <p>Housing starts for the last year exceeded the target of 35,000.  It is welcome and commendable that we have reached that level.  We have much more work to do, however, and it is important in this context that we remove any obstacles that could hinder young people in their efforts to try to find homes.  I have been contacted by several young people who obtained planning permission to build homes in the last five years.  They have been unable to commence building those homes because of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the inflation levels we have, and have had for decades, the shortage of building materials and difficulties getting builders and other tradespeople.  Those young people are finding that their planning permissions are about to expire.  Such planning permission, as the Minister of State is aware, normally has a fixed duration of five years.  It is possible to get an extension under section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, where substantial work has been completed on a home.  An extension of approximately two years can be obtained in those circumstances to allow the building to be finished.  <\/p> <p>The young people I am dealing with have been unable to start the works for which they have planning permission.  They were able to get the required planning permission, but they have not been able to start the building work.  I firmly believe that in cases where young people have got planning permission, but where its validity is now nearing an end because it has not been possible to commence building works due to a combination of factors, including the impact of Covid-19 and challenges regarding costs and finding materials and builders and other tradespeople, there should be some flexibility in the system to allow for the extension of that planning permission for approximately two years.  That would allow people in such circumstances to build the homes they need so badly.  <\/p> <p>Such facilitation operated until recently, perhaps until last September or October, when local authorities were informed that it would no longer apply.  I can understand that change in the context of large projects where developers, for whatever reason, might not be able to follow through.  A push is under way to try to get as much building done as possible.  However, in situations where young people who spent thousands of euro getting planning permission were unable, through no fault of their own, to commence their homes, an extension should be granted to allow them to start to building them.  We all know we need many more homes for our young people to enable us to start making inroads in addressing this crisis.  I hope the Minister of State will have some positive news for me.  No pressure, of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#D00400","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Before the Minister of State responds, I welcome our visitors in the Gallery.

The maximum duration for residential development planning permission to remain valid is ten years.  Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for example, enables a planning authority to extend the initial duration of planning permission, provided that certain conditions are met.  In September 2021, the Minister instituted a package of measures to amend section 42 of the Act and related provisions in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, including, among other aspects, a new temporary provision in the context of section 42.  Section 42(1B) was introduced to respond to the construction delays caused by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This provided a further extension of the duration for planning permission by an extra two years, or until 31 December 2023, whichever first occurs, subject to certain requirements being met.  Section 28(1) of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 was commenced, which entailed the deletion of section 42(1)(a)(ii) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This removes the possibility of an extension of duration for uncommenced developments or developments where substantial works have not been carried out.<\/p> <p>Section 42(8) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was introduced to provide that: \"A planning authority shall not extend the appropriate period under this section in relation to a permission if an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment would be required in relation to the proposed extension\".  As such, a planning authority can only grant an extension of duration where it is satisfied that: the development has commenced; substantial works have been completed; the development will be completed in a reasonable time; and an environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment are not required for the proposed extension.<\/p> <p>I note the concerns raised regarding the lack of a lead-in time for the commencement of section 28(1) of the 2016 Act which deleted the power to grant an extension of duration for uncommenced development.  However, this provision has been enacted on the Statute Book since 2016, providing ample time for developers to apply for an extension of duration or to commence a development before the provision was commenced in 2021.  Cognisant of the recent impacts of Covid-19 on the construction industry, section 42(1B) provides, on a temporary basis, for further extensions in respect of planning permissions where an extension of duration has already been availed of, by up to an additional two years or until 31 December 2023, whichever first occurs.  This will facilitate the completion of developments - such as vital housing projects - already commenced and with substantial works carried out, which were delayed or interrupted due to the impacts of Covid-19 on construction activity.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While there may be legitimate reasons a developer has not commenced or carried out substantial works under a planning permission, to allow such developments avail of an extension or further extension beyond their initial duration of five years or possibly more in such circumstances would conflict with the Department's objective to expedite the activation of planning permissions and completion of developments that have substantial work already carried out, particularly in respect of the delivery of housing.  Any interventions in this area must have a positive effect on development and incentivise developers to activate and complete planning permissions to the greatest extent possible, particularly with regard to housing developments.  Accordingly, it is not under consideration at this point to provide for further extensions of duration for planning permissions for developments that have not been commenced or have not been substantially completed within the initial duration of the permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#D00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

On 3 May 1791, Poland proclaimed its modified codified constitution as the first country in Europe and the second in the world after the United States to do so.  The liberal system codified in the constitution of 3 May was brought down by the partitions which ended the existence of the sovereign Polish state.  During the following 123 years of foreign domination, this symbolic document was seen as a sterling example of the successful reform and sustained hope for the eventual restoration of Polish independence which finally came to pass in November 1918.<\/p><p>There are many links between Ireland and Poland and one of those acknowledged in 2019 was that of Pawel Strzelecki, a Polish explorer and humanitarian, who during the Great Irish Famine volunteered as an agent in the British relief association to help the starving Irish.  When in Ireland, he came up with a scheme of assisting the starving population by focusing primarily on children and feeding and clothing them through a network of local schools.  It was an innovative approach for those times and as a result, more than 200,000 children were saved from starvation.  In 2019, the Polish Embassy produced an exhibit, A Forgotten Polish Hero of the Great Irish Famine: Paul Strzelecki&rsquo;s Struggle to Save Thousands.  This exhibit was opened by President Michael D. Higgins.<\/p><p>The Irish census in 2016 indicated that the Polish community in Ireland is our largest national minority with a population of 122,500.  The oldest Polish organisations in Ireland are the Polish Social and Cultural Association, Ognisko Polskie CLG and the Irish Polish Society.  Their aims are to preserve the bonds among Polish people living in Ireland.  Many of these organisations are engaged in various forms of supporting Ukrainian refugees.<\/p><p>The Polish diaspora is very active in the area of education.  There are more than 40 Polish schools in Ireland.  The Irish and Polish military contingents in Lebanon serve together as part of the UN mandate as the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.

Some 481 workers have lost their lives over the past decade in workplace accidents.  In the first few months of 2022 alone, seven lives have been lost.  While we have decent health and safety legislation in this country, deaths are still happening within workplaces, deaths that are completely unnecessary and should never have happened.

This road is necessary for businesses to start to thrive in the city centre.  There is investment in enhancing public transport, trains and buses, and I do not question that.  Everybody is in support of public transport.  However, to build three-quarters of a road and for the rest of the road to disappear is not acceptable.  I ask the Leader to write to the Minister for Transport of her support in relation to this.  My understanding is that it was through intervention from the Department that the road disappeared.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#M00400","speaker":"1695","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Yesterday evening I took the unusual course of action of going back home to Cork to attend an event.

Hundreds were relocated out of the area.  It was an unfortunate and ugly part of Irish history.  It is a part of our Decade of Centenaries, where we have to celebrate the good, the bad and the ugly.

There is a plea to recognise there is clearly an emergency and a crisis and other issues we do not talk about or acknowledge and which are not being resolved.  I will contact both the Minister and the Taoiseach's office today because it is long beyond time that the people of the Senator's part of the world, and indeed Clare and Shannon, deserve recognition that there is a problem and that a task force be set up to solve that problem sooner rather than later.  I will also send a letter to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to try to figure out where the missing quarter of the road has gone and what the intention is.  We need a debate, as Senator Buttimer said, on the national development plan and the bits that were on it but are not on it and when they will be returned to it.

The most unfortunate part of what has happened in recent weeks is that we have created a crisis where there should not be one.  It is a crisis of communications more than anything else.  What is unfortunate is the response of senior politicians, telling people they have nothing to worry about when the thing they are worrying about was caused by the carelessness of the communications over recent weeks.  I will arrange a debate in the next couple of weeks and we will see if we can find a resolution collectively to something we all know has to come to an end.  It has to be done in a meaningful way, so that it does not upset people's lives in such a disastrous way as would have unfolded on 1 September.  I am glad the Taoiseach announced yesterday that no changes will be made this year and that we will sit around the table and find resolutions.<\/p> <p>Senator Sherlock talked about it being Workers' Memorial Day.  It is hard to fathom that 481 people have lost their lives in the last ten years in the three professions with the most dangerous circumstances, yet we know it and it is not a surprise to us every year.  We need to redouble our efforts to make sure that, in the industries with the most work accidents, namely, agriculture, construction and ports and docks, we do as much training as we can and create as much awareness as we can to highlight the lost lives.  I thank the Senator for bringing that to our attention.<\/p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on the national development plan 2040.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to come to the Chamber in the next couple of weeks.  The Senator also asked for a debate on Moorhead and our local government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is coming to the Chamber on 12 May to talk about local government.  That is already in the diary.<\/p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne is looking for a debate on leaving certificate reform.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Foley, in the last couple of weeks.  It is dispiriting but not unexpected to get the response from the teachers unions we did.  After 20 years of trying to grapple with this, we now need to once and for all address the issues teachers are raising.  It concerns the interactions with parents and the fear we saw they experienced during Covid, when the assessments took place.  I do not think teachers have any real issue with continuous assessment other than the ones they have laid on the table.  Where there is a will to find a solution, which could be with neighbouring schools, there will be a way.  I will arrange that debate in the next couple of days.<\/p> <p>It is frustrating that these things take so long but I welcome students finally having the seat on the NCCA.

It provides that the commission may undertake strategic reviews of the sectors regulated by the commission in respect of the protection of workers' rights.  I cannot accept the amendment for the following reasons: in the first instance, policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation.  The amendment is also straying into matters that may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  In particular, section 11(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides the WRC shall conduct reviews and monitor developments as respects workplace relations.  I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the commission.  I understand the intention of the amendment.  The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors regulated by the Bill.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the concerns raised by the Senator regarding working conditions in the technology sector.  Last May, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade union experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions.  The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms.  In particular, one of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved and the types of distressing content she was required to view as part of the role.  The T&aacute;naiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment.  The T&aacute;naiste also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again.<\/p> <p>It is important to stress the protection of workers' rights is not a core function of the Department or its agencies.  It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy.  Moving responsibility for workers' rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors.  In this regard, the role will of an coimisi&uacute;n as an independent regulatory body is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video on demand and designated online services.  It is not intended to regulate employment relations or to assess working conditions.  As a general principle in considering any amendment that might expand the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n, I am conscious of not unduly expanding its scope to other areas of policy with the effect that its core functions might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#S00300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister for missing her contribution on this.

This risk is particularly relevant when it concerns staff who service providers and big tech.  They are relied on to review content to support moderation and adherence to online safety codes.  Concern was expressed by witnesses during pre-legislative scrutiny for these staff and their ability to fulfil their duties.  We have all seen the stories in the press of the working conditions faced by content moderators and the toll this work take on human beings.  There are developed best practice guidelines for staff of online platforms based on supports required and good work practices that should be utilised.  We want to see workers' rights included in the remit of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n and its work.

It is slightly different from the other amendments, which speak to a determination of time for party political broadcasts.  This speaks to the allocation of time for political programmes by public sector broadcasters.  Some programmes are particularly balanced and have a Government and an Opposition representative.  As the Minister will be aware, on an increasing number of programmes on RT&Eacute; a Government representative has to face up to three Opposition representatives.  The amendment calls for greater regard to be had to the levels of political representation of the respective political parties.  As an example, I will take the previous 12 broadcasts of \"The Week in Politics\" that have run since 5 December.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In those broadcasts, there have been 12 representatives from Sinn F&eacute;in, five from Fianna F&aacute;il, five from Fine Gael, two from the Green Party, four from the Labour Party, four from the Social Democrats, two from Aont&uacute;, which has one representative in these Houses, and two from People Before Profit.  Three Independents have all appeared twice, and there have been two other Independents.  The proposal behind this amendment is that there is a requirement on the broadcaster to have regard to the size of political parties.  There are, as we know, differences between the political parties in government on certain issues, and it is important that different political parties get the opportunity to express those differences.  It is a matter of ensuring that in making decisions on the make-up of panels on programmes, there is an appropriate balance that has regard to the size of the political parties.  There is a view among the Government parties that it is completely unfair if panels regularly comprise just one Government representative who must face up to three Opposition representatives.  It is often the case that a Government representative is asked to account for differences between the political parties in government and to state whether it represents a crisis, yet differences between various Opposition parties are not pointed out.  Amendment No. 96 simply requires that regard be had to the size of political parties or groupings within the Oireachtas, or to their performance in the previous election, when decisions are being made regarding the composition of panels.<\/p><p>It should be said that many programmes are very balanced, with one Government representative and one Opposition representative.  However, it is often the case that more representation is given to people who deny climate change, for instance, than political parties who argue in favour of accepting there is climate change.

I do not know whether the weighting of political parties will be the way we move towards more balanced and nuanced coverage of political issues.  It seems that we could just move into a permanent election dynamic.  We see this sometimes in the D&aacute;il.  Political programmes are not simply about seeking support but also about perspectives.  Someone like me, who is almost never on the television, can bring something to a debate.  I do not feature very much in the media but, along with my colleague, I have 150 amendments, which indicates a lot of thought and perspective on this Bill alone.  If we go simply by weighting, we almost lose the voices of each person.  I have great respect for every parliamentarian and recognise the individual perspectives and ideas people are bringing; however, if a contribution simply becomes a symbolic proxy piece, it is really worrying.  I am really worried about that direction.  One needs to look to situations and recognise the diversity within a Government, whether it has three partners or otherwise.  There is thinking to be done in this regard but weighting by party could mean those with really important things to say on issues do not get heard.  It may happen that there are two or three voices.  Two members of the same party might be the key debaters who need to be heard on an issue.  It would be a pity if that got lost.  I would be concerned if it were a matter of holding the space.<\/p> <p>My next comment is not directed at the proposer of the amendment or the Minister but I am aware of a party in government whose leader was specifically reported as having been given an edict to make sure not as much platform space would be given to Opposition voices and other perspectives.  That is a concern.  Sometimes I worry &ndash; again, this is not directed at those present &ndash; about some of the rulings of the Cathaoirleach on space given and time.  That is to be debated.  We fight for parliamentary space all the time because the Government can win every vote.  It has a crushing majority, but it is really important that we can at least get our voices heard, air our ideas and try to persuade people.  In that sense, I have a concern although I understand the frustration.  I share it myself in many ways when I consider the way political programming is framed in Ireland.  This week has been a sterling example of one that entails a not-very-constructive debate quite specifically focused on heat rather than light.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#T00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for proposing these important amendments.  The coverage by broadcasters of our democratic process, particularly during electoral periods, can have a profound impact on the outcome of the process.  That is why broadcasting legislation has for many years sought to ensure fairness, objectivity and impartiality in both news coverage and the coverage of elections.  This Bill will extend those provisions to the video-on-demand services, reflecting the changing way in which citizens access new media.<\/p><p>As regards amendment No. 104, the party-political broadcast has played an important role in the democratic process by allowing political parties uncontested airtime to carry their message to the public.  For that reason, these broadcasts have been exempted from the general prohibition against the broadcasting or making available of advertisements directed towards a political end.  It is the intention of the Bill to continue this exemption in respect of party-political broadcasts.  However, I acknowledge that the use of the term &ldquo;party political programmes&rdquo; in section 9 of the Bill &ndash; inserting section 46M(4) into the Broadcasting Act 2009 &ndash; rather than &ldquo;party political broadcasts&rdquo; may give rise to some interpretive confusion if it is not clarified.  The term &ldquo;party political programmes&rdquo; was used <i>in lieu<\/i>of &ldquo;party political broadcasts&rdquo; to ensure the section covered both broadcasting services and video-on-demand services that would not be considered to make broadcasts.  I have asked my officials to examine this issue with a view to returning to this House on Report Stage.  I cannot promise Senators that I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage but I will certainly seek to set out any plans I have to address this issue.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 104 at this time but acknowledge the matter needs to be scrutinised closely.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 31 and 96 also address an issue that goes to the heart of our democratic process, namely, the coverage by broadcasters of political parties and the methodology for determining the allocation of that coverage.  Given that the allocation of coverage may play a role in determining the outcome of an election, I acknowledge that this is a contentious and controversial issue.  As amendment No. 31 recognises, the BAI, under section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, has issued a code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs &ndash; rule 27 &ndash; which deals with the coverage of elections by broadcasters.  Under the Bill, this code will continue in force upon the dissolution of the BAI and the establishment of the coimisi&uacute;n until such time as it is replaced by a media service code, which will apply not only to broadcasters but also to certain video-on-demand services.  At present, rule 27 places responsibility on broadcasters to develop mechanisms to fairly allocate coverage during elections rather than being prescriptive.  This is in contrast with the current situation in Britain, where Ofcom, as the audiovisual service regulator, issues prescriptive rules to broadcasters.<\/p><p>We have seen a transformation in the political landscape in this country over the past 12 years.  I recognise that this is posing a challenge for broadcasters, particularly RT&Eacute; in its role as our largest public service broadcaster, especially regarding the allocation of coverage during elections.  Given the complexity of this issue and the difficulty in arriving at a consensus, it is preferable that any common set of requirements for broadcasters in respect of party-political broadcasts or the editorial coverage of elections and referendums be made by the coimisi&uacute;n through media-service codes rather than through prescription by legislation, as suggested in amendment No. 31, which covers the election period, and amendment No. 96, which focuses on coverage across the board.  On that basis, I have asked my officials to further scrutinise the provisions of section 9 of the Bill, with which we insert subsections 46L(1) to (3) and the relevant measure in 46N into the Broadcasting Act to be sure that nothing in the text of the Bill would prevent the coimisi&uacute;n from setting such a common set of requirements through the media service codes.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I intend to request that an coimisi&uacute;n review the code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality governing news and current affairs with a view to addressing the issue of fairly allocating coverage of political parties in broadcasts and video-on-demand services, particularly during elections.

It is constructive and part of recognising that debates on issues extend beyond political and electoral debate.  That was the context for and what we were trying to do with our amendment.  We will move it and bring it back on Report Stage.  The Minister said that she will engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on this aspect and that we could examine the issue.  To clarify, in my intervention I was speaking about concerns regarding amendment No. 96.  I may also have some worries about the wording of amendment No. 31.  On the core principle, however, I wish to be very clear.  It is appropriate that there are clear rules for election periods.  We can tease out and debate exactly what those should be, but it is important that there are proper rules, weightings and allocations of space in the context of elections and referendums.  This is part of the democratic process.<\/p> <p>That aspect, though, is different from the wider debate.  This point has come up and it is one of the reasons our amendment is useful in both contexts.  It is clear in specifying political purposes relating to electoral activities and particular outcomes in that part of politics, as opposed to the discussion of policy.  Our amendment is important for that reason.  We will be able to discuss the matter again, but I wish to indicate now that my primary concern in this regard relates to such a definition of \"political purposes\" leaking into the general policy discussion space and not applying to the strict regulation of election periods.  We need that stricture, and something similar might be needed, regarding spending in online spaces during election periods.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#U00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I agree with many of the points made by Senator Higgins.  Regarding the Minister&rsquo;s response, this is at the heart of our democracy.  I refer to ensuring that all sides of a political argument get aired.  It is important that discussion is based on evidence.  As the Minister rightly stated, however, the political landscape has changed enormously, and it is important that a broad range of views is well reflected.  Senator Higgins should be on television and radio more often.  She is well able to articulate her point of view.  From the perspective of the Government parties, however, she will understand that it is often felt that the differences of opinions within Government parties are not always aired on substantive policy issues, barring the heat and light debate we had this week.  It is usually presented in a sensationalist kind of way.  Therefore, this is an important debate.<\/p> <p>I appreciate the challenges broadcasters face, one of which relates to the McKenna judgment.  This requires, particularly during referendum campaigns, that equal weight be given to the two sides of an argument.  I have a bit of a problem with that.  I have no difficulty with situations where equal weight is given to evidence-based arguments on two sides.  If, however, we have a referendum in the future on tough measures to deal with climate change, for example, I do not believe it would be appropriate that our national broadcaster should be giving 50% of the space in such debates to climate sceptics, although it is appropriate that we would have a meaningful debate around our approach to addressing some of these issues.  A similar situation pertains to issues such as the Good Friday Agreement, where there was overwhelming support among all the political parties.  Yet, equal space had to be given to fringe dissident groups.  In that light, we may need to revisit the McKenna judgment.<\/p> <p>This is an extremely important debate and we must have it.  I accept that it is much wider in nature and concerned with more than just the legislation before us.  I agree with Senator Higgins regarding the importance of there being clear rules, especially during election periods.  As we know, however, the political narrative can be very much shaped outside election periods as well.  If voices are not being heard, that is a concern.  Some of this endeavour relates to different voices being heard.  Equally, there is also concern regarding situations where those who represent larger political parties often do not have the opportunity for their voices to be heard.<\/p> <p>In light of this reflection, I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 96 when we come to it.  This is about more than the legislation.  Part of the challenge we face, and this goes back to our earlier discussion about allowing political advertising on radio and television, is that while we can regulate what is going on within those controlled broadcasting spaces to a certain extent, our bigger challenge concerns what is happening in the online space.  I refer to how we can ensure there is fair and balanced debate in that broader space.  Certainly, some of what we will see emanating from the electoral commission legislation will be important.  It will be key for this regulator to work closely with the electoral commission.  I am deeply concerned, however, that if we do not manage to ensure we have evidence-based policy discussion, and ensure that there is fairness and balance in such debate and that reasonable voices are heard, our politics will descend into what is being driven by online polarisation and by some of what we have seen happen in the United States and other democracies.  This is a broader debate than what we are discussing involving this legislation.  I am, however, heartened by the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  In reflecting before Report Stage, it would be good if some of what was mentioned can be integrated into this legislation.  I think the Minister understands the concerns being expressed here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#U00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

The amendments submitted by me and Senator Higgins are similar in their intent.  Amendment No. 33 seeks to ensure that not less than two of the members shall be women, including the chairperson, but in the case where there are six whole-time members in addition to the chairperson not less than three of those members shall be women.

Of particular relevance to these benefits have been my actions to ensure gender equality in the appointment to the State boards of bodies under the aegis of my Department.

This relates to the core premise, the online safety commissioner.  When articles appear in newspapers, they only cover five sentences from this Bill.  The only thing they refer to is an online safety commissioner.  That is one of the key expectations, hopes and promises that has been made in respect of this legislation.  As we discussed the last day, the concern is that there is no actual provision for an online safety commissioner.  That role is central to this legislation and to the meaning of this legislation.  For those of us unhappy with other aspects of the legislation in weighing up our support for it, it is really crucial that the online safety commissioner is contained in the Bill before it goes on to the D&aacute;il because otherwise we would all be very aware that we were sending on a Bill with an acknowledged gap - something that needs to be there.  The two aspects we highlighted previously were the individual complaints mechanism and the online safety commissioner in that regard.<\/p><p>Another amendment to this section was ruled out of order but it relates very closely to the idea of the online safety commissioner.  In a constructive way, we tried to set out a little bit of what the role of an online safety commissioner might be.  Senator Ruane might speak somewhat more to this because she took the lead on it.  It sets out how an online safety commissioner could engage or play a role in the regulatory framework set out in the legislation.<\/p><p>My amendments are profoundly modest, possibly excessively so in that regard.  I simply state that we should just at least name one.  We are not empowered to insert in the Bill that there should be resources in this area but I think the Minister knows that there must be resources for online safety and an online safety commissioner.  I hope she will introduce amendments to that effect.  However, what we can do and what the Minister can do is to at least give the commitment that of these six commissioners, at least one will be an online safety commissioner.  That seems to be a very clear first step.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for six members and for one to have a particular role as chair.  It would be appropriate at that juncture to also indicate that another of these commissioners will play a particular role as being the online safety commissioner.  Of course, arguments could be made to have more than one in that respect.  Indeed, arguments can be made for having more than six people on the commission, but that may be a separate day's discussion.  The public need to see that an online safety commissioner is part of the fundamental starting structure.  I know the Minister is working on proposals on how that will work, including the resources and how the online safety commissioner will lead on various of the functions assigned.<\/p><p>I will shortly hand over to my colleague, Senator Ruane.  She set out some of the thoughts we have for how an online safety commissioner might operate.  The crucial point relating to amendments Nos. 35 and 36 is to give the guarantee that there will be an online safety commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#V01300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendment No. 41, which is along similar lines to the other amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#V01400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>It is profoundly modest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#V01500","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Yes, profoundly modest as well.  However, it goes a little further in providing that in naming an online safety commissioner, it will not prevent other commissioners from also having responsibility for online safety.  The core point in all these amendments - we are coming at this from the same perspective - is that as part of the legislation one of the commissioners should have a very specific role and that he or she should be appointed as the online safety commissioner.  When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht engaged with the Australian e-safety commissioner, one of the merits we saw of that office having that title was that there was an individual, a champion, czar or whatever phrase we want to use, who was able to drive this particular agenda.<\/p> <p>The amendment that Senator Cassells and I proposed provides that while online safety is the responsibility of the entire commission, one individual is clearly named to lead on this.  In the recruitment for the commission through the Public Appointments Service, one of the requirements should be to recruit somebody with expertise in the area of online safety, harm reduction, specifically looking at the safety of children online.  When the seven members of the commission are appointed, the idea would be that they would come from different backgrounds with some of them having specific experience in broadcasting and one looking at regulatory law or whatever.  In the composition of the commission, it is ideal to have people from different backgrounds.  The legislation should specifically identify one of the commissioners as the online safety commissioner and for him or her to champion it.<\/p> <p>I will await the Minister's response.  It is core.  Certainly, whether it is dealt with today or on Report Stage, I do not believe this legislation can progress unless an online safety commissioner is named very clearly within it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#V01600","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>As Senators, there are a number of areas that we cannot make proposals on regarding the online safety commissioner mainly relating to the resourcing of the commissioner itself, rather than just the resources for the commission in general.

My amendments in this area were deemed to create a cost on the State.  Again, it is probably something that one could argue about because this is potentially already supposed to be part of the commission's job description anyway.

That, as Senators have said today, is the core point being addressed in these amendments.  Section 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides for the delegation of the performance of some of the functions of an coimisi&uacute;n to an individual commissioner.  As such, there is nothing in the Bill to preclude an coimisi&uacute;n from delegating the functions relating to online safety set out in Part 8A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to a commissioner who shall be responsible for online safety.  Indeed, the delegation of the online safety functions to a dedicated online safety commissioner has actually always been the intention. <\/p> <p>As Senators have stated, it was one of the key recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.

I am pleased to advise this House that good progress has been made on the drafting of such an amendment in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.  I am conscious of the feeling in the House that a Government amendment addressing this issue should, if time permits, be introduced in the Seanad.

It should mean that there is a leader with responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#W00800","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 36:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 22, line 7, after &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, the Online Safety Commissioner&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#W01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 37 to 40, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together, by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#W01200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 22, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(3A) The Minister shall agree with the Public Appointments Service the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy on the Commission.  <\/blockquote> <p>These amendments are related.  They relate to the make-up of the commission in terms of experience.  Again, we lean very heavily on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 and earlier legislation relating to the make-up of that commission.  The Bill, as authored, provides that members of the media commission shall be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  However, the Bill does not explicitly state the selection criteria or the process by which members will be recommended to the Minister by the PAS.  It is hugely important that there is oversight of and transparency in the selection criteria and appointment processes.  The media commission stands to play a hugely important and influential role in Irish life and its impact will be felt throughout Irish society.  Thus, it is imperative that the public has trust in the media commission and its membership.  Amendment No. 37 will encourage such trust.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 38, because this goes back to 1998, the reference to membership of the Traveller community is separate to earlier definitions in terms of race, including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin.  There might be a more up-to-date version of how we have laid this out.  In 1998 the Traveller community would not have been deemed or confirmed to be an ethnic minority.  There is probably no need to separate them out.  That may just be me being pedantic, but so be it.  Currently the Bill does not make specific provisions in terms of experience, both lived and learned, or the acumen required of prospective commissioners.  This amendment seeks to ensure diversity in the make-up and perspectives of the media commission, in addition to an understanding of human rights and equality matters.  Given the broad remit of the media commission and the impact it will have on a cross section of society, it is important that the commission is both reflective and understanding of the diversity of Irish life and society, and has a good grasp of the implications of the implementation of its regulatory powers on human rights, equality and civil liberties.  A precedent for a legislative provision of this nature is contained in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  There is precedent for this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#W01300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I am not going to add very much because my colleague has put the case very clearly.  These amendments build on the core purpose of the audiovisual media services directive, which is the starting point for this legislation.  As we discussed previously, that is not simply about protective, performative or managerial functions but also about a proactive role in the promotion of equality of inclusion, diversity, participation in the cultural space and so forth.  There is a really positive role for the commission there and it is really important.  Of course, there is also a public duty with regard to equality and human rights and one of the best ways to make sure that public duty is met is if it is reflected in the make-up of the commission, that is, those who are making the decisions.  That is going to have an important impact.<\/p> <p>In amendment No. 38 we set out a number of criteria, based on the IHREC legislation.  There could, of course, be a very strong argument for at least giving the space for socioeconomic criteria to be included, which was discussed previously.  We did not seek to prematurely anticipate that but it would be appropriate down the line.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendment No. 37, which I hope the Minister will consider if she cannot accept amendment No. 38, is not prescriptive in that sense.  Perhaps we could table another version with which the Minister may agree.  If she is concerned that this is too much for herself, or another Minister in the future, perhaps there are caveats and perhaps the Oireachtas could see what those criteria are.  I wish to point out that these are not generic appointments and people would have a very particular function.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 37, which relates to amendment No. 39, seeks clear selection criteria because sometimes a Minister simply appoints people to boards who have experience of being a member of a board and are used to being on a board but, in fact, one might need people who do not have direct experience of a board because they have relevant experience in terms of a personal diversity perspective that they bring or, as in amendment No. 39, their expertise is very pertinent.  All of the amendments reflect the complexity of this area and, therefore, it is important that those appointed to this role are not simply briefed and follow through but that they actually bring expertise.  It is currently unclear and - reserving the right in the future -  amendment No. 38 is modelled on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in terms of the diversity and make up of a board, and perhaps I am pre-empting amendment No 39, but I would also look to the climate legislation.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 39 seeks to insert the line \"an appropriate balance of knowledge of, and expertise in the following: (a) arts and culture; (b) data protection and digital empowerment; (c) online safety and digital regulation; and (d) human rights and public participation.&rdquo;.  Somebody can recommend systems and other things that we want to discuss but we really want to ensure that people have the core tools to understand that information.  When we brought forward the climate legislation we brought forward a really clear list of the types of expertise that is needed and a requirement of balanced expertise on the board.  Senator Ruane and I have set out what we think the board should look like in amendments Nos. 38 and 39.  Our amendment No. 37 simply asks that the Minister is clear about what the board might look like.  I think it is important that more thought is given to the make up of the board in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#W01400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>These are interesting amendments.  It is my view that when the commission is appointed we should be really proud of them because they are going to be among the most powerful regulators in the State as they will oversee this work.  The board should reflect diversity.  I am always cautious about naming too many groups and trying to match them up.  The board needs a wide variety of expertise, which relates to the earlier point on the online safety commissioner that there should be someone with specific expertise.  In terms of amendment No. 39 I would certainly support that at least one of the members should have an expertise in the area of online safety.  I would add, because there is always a fear that it will get lost, that having experience in broadcasting as one of the specific areas would be particularly important.  Yes, one of the areas should be digital empowerment but I am not sure about data protection.  Perhaps data protection is more appropriate with the Data Protection Commission in terms of experience and responsibility but I think that can be teased out.<\/p> <p>The Minister will be aware, in terms of appointments to the boards of RT&Eacute; and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, that it is more clearly specified as to the levels of experience and knowledge that those appointees are expected to have, and their backgrounds.  The principle of this can be explored in more detail.  We can look at how to ensure a very diverse commission yet at the same time get the seven best people who have a broad range of experience and knowledge so they can, as a collective body, contribute because we want a regulatory body that is effective.<\/p> <p>There is a dispute about whether there should be seven commissioners.  Having seven minds working around a table on these core issues is better than one.  My comment speaks to the point made about the fact that there is only one Data Protection Commissioner as opposed to a series of them and I know that is a separate debate.  We need to think about, when this commission is up and running and when the recruitment process is taking place, what the advertisement will say and identify as the core criteria.  The RT&Eacute; and BAI legislation could provide the basis for some of this discussion but my key concern is that whatever we do we ensure that we get the best people on the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#X00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their amendments.  It is important to note that these are not board positions but full-time regulators who will go through a rigorous process to ensure their suitability similar to the Data Protection Commissioner or ComReg.  Amendment No. 37 amends section 11 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to provide that I, as Minister, would agree the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy on the commission.  I believe this amendment might duplicate provisions set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, in particular section 34, which sets out the functions of the Public Appointments Service.<\/p> <p>Section 11(3) of the Broadcasting Acting 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides that the chairperson and commissioners shall be appointed by me, as Minister, on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service.  One of the reasons for specifying this in the Bill is to ensure that the codes and practices, set out under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, applied to the recruitment process.  The recruitment and selection processes will be closely guided by the code of practice on appointments to positions in the Civil and Public Service, which set out the application of the principles of probity, merit, best practice, fairness and transparency to the recruitment of public servants.  This will ensure that the process is open, transparent and fair.<\/p> <p>My officials are working with the Public Appointments Service to develop the selection criteria for the appointment of the commissioners.  I anticipate that this will involve an executive search process given the specific skillset and expertise required, which Senators have mentioned, that commissioners and particularly the online safety commissioner may require.  I, as Minister, will ultimately agree the selection criteria for the post as set out in the recruitment booklet that will contain the job description and selection criteria for the role of commissioner.  Given that I believe the intention set out in the amendment is already provided for in legislation, and in practice, I do not propose to accept it.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 describe some areas of knowledge, expertise and experience that both I, as Minister, and the Public Appointments Service shall seek to ensure that an coimisi&uacute;n has.  I agree that it would be desirable that commissioners would have collectively, or individually, some or all of the knowledge and expertise described in the amendments.  However, while I recognise the intention of these amendments, I would be concerned that there is a danger in being overly prescriptive as to the knowledge and experience that members of the commission should have.  So I am not persuaded of the merits of amendments Nos. 38 and 39 and, therefore, cannot accept them.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 40 would appear to duplicate provisions already in law.  I understand that section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights.  As a public body, an coimisi&uacute;n will already be subject to the provisions of that Act.  I expect that an coimisi&uacute;n would not only comply with section 42 of the Act but also, in accordance with the spirit of the Act, demonstrate a culture and practice of respect of human rights.<\/p> <p>I understand that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by the State and entered into force in 2018.  I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth about the status of the convention.  So while I do not propose to accept amendment No. 40 today I propose to return to the matter on Report Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#X00300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>On amendments Nos. 39 and 40, there is a Public Appointments Service but, as the Minister mentioned, it draws from the civil and public service code.

We do not prescriptively say that any individual must meet these standards and seem to interfere in the process there.  We are not interfering with any of the functions of the Public Appointments Service in recommending or of the Minister in approving.  We simply say that in performing their functions they should seek to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of knowledge.  That is really important because it is not simply to do with the calibre of the individuals; that is not in question and the Public Appointments Service does that very well.  It is about ensuring that the commission as a whole is equipped with core expertise and knowledge.<\/p><p>The Minister may like how we have framed it or she may prefer her own wording.  However, we should have an examination of the functions and should give some thought to what some of the key skills are.  The broadcasting legislation was mentioned and it would be interesting to examine that.  I think that climate legislation is another important example.  This is key because the commission will not simply be one of the most important regulators in the State but probably one of the most important regulators in Europe.<\/p><p>I had not realised that amendment No. 40 was in this grouping.  I thank the Minister for responding to it.  It relates to the public duty on equality and human rights.  I reserve the right that we might come back.  Every public body in the State has a positive duty to promote equality and human rights - not simply not to discriminate, but to actively promote.  There is a very uneven understanding of that responsibility.  In the reporting of the commission, obviously we are not creating new law here, but we are trying to almost remind and ensure that there is thought given and that it is reflected.  We suggested including it here in the performance of functions.  I may come back with an amendment to it in the reporting on the performance of functions.  Perhaps that is a more appropriate way to approach it.<\/p><p>I do not want to anticipate what the Minister might have to say about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  However, I remind her that it has been ratified.  It is law and it is an obligation on the State.  The optional protocol allows for the individual complaints mechanism.  That may be one of the reasons we want to get it into legislation early because if we wait a while, we can end up waiting a long time.  The optional protocol to it is still to be brought through.  The actual articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are there and have been ratified by Ireland.  Its operation should be reflected in our legislation.  Because it is a new commitment that the State has made, it would be really appropriate.  The audiovisual directive contains very explicit language on disability and inclusion being one of the core purposes of that directive.  It would be appropriate for that to be referenced in some way here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#X00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I will return to amendment No. 40.

In that context it is very important that declaration of interest is not just there as a standard, but that there is very strong follow-through.

It should not be the case that a person cannot declare his or her interests and then claim to have simply forgotten and for it then to be said that, luckily, no significant decision came about as a result of that.  The very fact of the omission of a declaration of interest of itself should be a ground whereby the Government not \"must\" but \"may\" remove a commissioner rather than it having to be proven to have been of great significance that he or she did not do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#Z00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>As I have indicated already, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 42 and 45 because I believe the Bill, as published, addresses the issues raised in the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#Z00300","speaker":"1471"},{"type":"vote","time":1651138200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 7; N\u00edl, 14.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Alice-Mary Higgins and Lynn Ruane; N\u00edl, Senators Se\u00e1n Kyne and Malcolm Byrne.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#AA00100","aye":["1632","1699","1662","1688","1681","1683","1684"],"nay":["1633","1636","1637","1638","1695","1639","1640","1656","1665","1666","1667","1693","1682","1685"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 43:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 23, line 38, after &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Where the Minister has decided to remove a commissioner from office, as well as laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas a statement on the decision and the reasons for it, and given that so many documents get laid before the Houses, we suggest it would also be laid before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.

It is the exclusion of members of local authorities from effectively applying for these jobs.  As the Minister is aware, this is not about a political appointment of a Minister appointing somebody to a role.  This is somebody who may be a councillor and have a specific area of expertise.  They apply for the job and come through an independent and fair process but because they are a member of a local authority, they are excluded.  I totally understand why all of the other categories are excluded.  There are valid reasons Members of the Oireachtas are excluded.  However, at a time when we are trying to encourage people to become local authority members to continue to exclude them from State boards or holding other offices, such as a member of the media commission, is wrong.  I do not see where there will be a conflict of interest between somebody being a local councillor and a member of the commission.  Obviously, they will not be able to pronounce on matters related to the media as a local councillor.  However, as a general rule, there is nothing in this legislation that devolves any authority to any local government.  There is no bar in the exclusions from somebody, for example, being an adjunct professor of media at one of our universities.  Yet, simply because someone is a member of a local authority, they are being excluded.  A similar provision is being provided later on, which is what amendment No. 52 applies to with regard to staff within the commission.<\/p><p>The Minister knows how difficult it is to try to encourage good people to run for local election, and it is becoming tougher and tougher.  To continue to close off career opportunities does not make sense.  I want to know the justification as to why a member of a local authority cannot apply for a staff job working at the commission, or cannot apply to become a commissioner.  There could be somebody who may be a regulatory lawyer with a specific expertise who happens to be a member of a local authority and who would make a very good commissioner.  Somebody who has broadcast or film production experience would also make a very good commissioner.  It is not about the Minister making a political appointment, as Minister; it is about people going through the application process and qualifying on the basis of their merits.<\/p><p>I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, as the Minister of State with responsibility for local government and planning, this morning because this is being applied to legislation across the board.  I would totally get it if local authorities had some kind of function in this area but they do not and will not.  I will look to push this unless the Minister can give me a valid reason a local authority member should be excluded from either applying from the job of commissioner or being a member of staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#BB00500","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I want to agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne.

The Minister and I served on the same local authority.  She and I know councillors throughout the country who have particular expertise and who could be of use, not just to the commission in this Bill, but in a whole range of other areas.

Beginning before somebody is a local authority member, if you were a staff member of an organisation and were considering putting yourself forward for public office, with the great likelihood of being unsuccessful, which the majority of candidates are, you are looking at very strong signals that if you are successful, you would be required to give up your role.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We do not see measures corresponding to those that are rightly available to members of the teaching profession.  For example, there is an option for a teacher to take a period of leave simply to run for public office.  There is, therefore, encouragement within the contracts for teachers to do this.  Again, there is nothing that encourages people who are employees.  There are many self-employed people and also many teachers in the Oireachtas.  The reason for this is that while certain professions make it easier, other professions do not.  It would be a real pity if good people did not run for office because it would mean taking a gamble.  If they are getting an oblique signal that they will have to step down if they are successful, they may not even run.  There is something there around the message that we send.

It will have an incredibly important role in the State, Europe and internationally.  These provisions are borrowed from other areas.  There is a concern here.  I am struck by the figure of &euro;13,000 because I think it has been regarded as a tiny figure.  However, it is a significant figure for some people.  It is a sign of who we often expect to be in roles that we consider that they would regard &euro;13,000 as an insignificant figure in terms of the aggregate value of investments, bonds and debentures in a particular online service provider.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A sum of &euro;13,000 is significant.  What is also important is the fact that this is the provider.  We may have a situation whereby we have some people who are ending up with smaller amounts of shares but in multiple online providers and perhaps linked companies that are online providers.  There is a whole question there.<\/p><p>The very fact that one is a shareholder in a company or online provider that one is regulating is in itself really significant.  It is already in itself potentially a concern because one has a relationship with that online service provider in that context.  If one does inadvertently happen to have shares as part of a portfolio, they really should be divested before taking up the role as commissioner.  The fact of having a share-holding relationship with a provider is already relevant and should be considered as a \"relevant interest\" in terms of a particular communications media piece.  One may also be part of a community of shareholders whereby one has a small share but may be part of a community of shareholders.  We know that it is the case in relation to some of the online media providers that are likely to be regulated by this legislation.<\/p><p>I know that these are provisions taken from other legislation but they merit a real examination, particularly bearing in mind the very significant financial role of this commission.  The Minister mentioned, in relation to the local authorities, the importance of not just the actuality but the perception of something that would be improper.  To be a shareholder in a company that one is going to regulate and set the code for is in itself something that sets a very negative perception.  In that regard, I hope the Minister will consider these amendments and take them on board and will also address situations where somebody may have a relevant interest in a sector or a set of companies, that is, he or she has stakes in multiple companies within a sector.  One of the sectors which many people in this House hope will be very strongly clamped down on and regulated, for example, is the area of cryptocurrency.

I agree in principle with some of the points that are being made.  Senator Ruane said that the figures are a little arbitrary but what is important is that there are figures there.  The effect of the amendments would be to remove any limits.  On gifts, for example, if a provider offered one tea or coffee, bought one a drink or invited one to a particular event, that could be classified as a gift and that may cause a difficulty.  There must be some kind of threshold unless we are moving to an Olympics-style situation whereby somebody cannot even accept a cup of tea.  I do not think that the figures are unreasonable but I understand the point the Senators are making.<\/p> <p>The amendment that Senator Cassells and I have tabled is more of a point for discussion really.  The assumption is that having an interest in one of these providers is purely based around having a financial interest, whereas in terms of how media operate at the moment, somebody can be a media influencer but may not necessarily have shares in the platform.  He or she would certainly have an interest in how that platform is regulated.  If an individual has a significant number of followers on a social media platform, he or she is going to take an interest in the manner in which that platform is going to be regulated.  <\/p> <p>If, for instance, somebody is appointed as a commissioner and he or she is a significant social media influencer and has a range of experiences, decisions could be made by the commission that could impact on the expansion of that person's influence using his or her own social media channels.  I accept that some of that may be around the development of codes of behaviour for commissioners by the new commission but we need to look at this in terms that are broader than just financial in the context of somebody's interest in particular platforms.  <\/p> <p>I appreciate the point that in this amendment the figure we include is arbitrary, that of 20,000 followers or subscribers, but if one is operating a YouTube channel with 20,000 subscribers and the commission is making decisions around the regulation of YouTube, one is going to have an interest in that, even though one may not have shares in YouTube.  We have included this amendment primarily for debate purposes.  When we look at media providers, we need to think about interests more broadly than simply having financial shares in a company.  These are very different platforms.  The media commission will look to regulate the metaverse in the future, for example.  If people have interests in the sense that they have a number of very popular avatars that are operating within the metaverse and if a decision is going to be made that may have an impact, that is a cause for concern.  We must think about how we can broaden the definition of interest beyond purely having a direct financial interest or share in a company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#DD00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Senator Byrne makes a fair point in relation to the gifts.

It is a fair point.  The issue on shares is important, though, especially in some of the more fast-moving providers.  How many times have these companies split?  How many times have the value of shares changed, with companies splitting four, five or six times?  That question of what gets boosted in its potential, or the early actor, is a concern.  We should not have a situation where people have shares in the companies that they are regulating but Senator Malcolm Byrne makes a good point on gifts.<\/p> <p>I would add a point back for debate in relation to the online accounts.  It is a good point but it should be more specifically directed at those who have a monetised or commercial personal account.  It is different when one has an account for which one is getting sponsorship, product placement, advertising and so on.  While the provider may not be paying one, it is facilitating one's economic activity indirectly, even though the monetary input comes from others.  Given that this is a section on financial interests, it would be better to identify that as a relevant issue but to make sure it is limited to the aforementioned individuals and not to someone who has, for example, put up lots of pictures of their adorable dog for no money at all, which lots of people liked.  I am actually thinking of my friend, Claire Power, who has a very beautiful dog.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#DD00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  I am thinking of my colleague, Senator Cassells, who spoke the other day about political advertising and said that Deputy Catherine Martin hates puppies, which for the record, is not true.  She loves puppies.  This is relevant even in the case of non-commercial accounts through which one is able to influence others.  It is not just about being able to commercially influence.  This may be about political influence or influence in other areas.  One may not be monetising it.  It is not just all about monetary gain.  Part of this relates to potential conflicts of interest.  If we appoint somebody as a commissioner who has 100,000 Twitter followers, he or she has significant influence on that platform, albeit it is not being used for monetary purposes.  I am not going to push this but we need further debate on how we determine what having an interest in a particular platform means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#DD00600","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their amendments but I do not propose to accept them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Catherine Martin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=28\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As regards amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48, section 12(13) of the Broadcasting 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, sets out what constitutes a relevant interest for the purpose of determining whether a commissioner should cease to hold office by virtue of him or her, or a connected person, which includes a family member, holding a relevant interest in a provider of communications media.  Section 12(11)(i) provides that a person shall cease to hold office as commissioner if he or she acquires a relevant interest in a provider of communications media.  The term \"provider of communications media\", as set out in section 3(2)(s) of the Bill, is a broad one.  It includes not only those services that will be subject to regulation by the coimisi&uacute;n but also newspapers or periodicals consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs.  A person is considered to have a relevant interest if he or she, or a connected person, holds equity with a value greater than &euro;5,000 or debt with a value greater than &euro;13,000 in a provider of communications media.  The person may also hold a relevant interest if he or she receives gifts or benefits with a value greater than &euro;650 from the provider or hold a directorship or shadow directorship in a provider.<\/p><p>A relevant interest may arise if a person or connected relative is party to an arrangement regarding land with the provider.  The values for the maximum debt and equity that may be held and the benefit that may be received were arrived at in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I believe the balance we have arrived at is correct.  It fulfils the public policy purpose of ensuring a commissioner does not inadvertently cause a cessation of office by virtue of him or her, or a connected person, acquiring a small interest or deriving a small benefit while also protecting against any conflict of interest that may arise.<\/p><p>I understand the intention of amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48 in seeking to go even further than the Bill in addressing conflicts of interest.  The thresholds also apply to connected persons, including family.  However, the proposed amendments could have unintended effects.  In particular, prohibiting the holding of debt or equity in providers of communications media by connected relatives could cause commissioners to cease office if a family member acquired any debt or equity whatsoever in a provider of communications media.  In this regard, I am thinking of pension products that involve investments in passive or active pension funds, which may give rise to small debt or equity holdings in respect of providers of communications media.  This may be wholly outside the control of the connected relative but would nonetheless require the commissioner to cease office if these amendments were accepted.  As I have said, I believe we have the balance right in the Bill in tackling any conflict of interest that may arise, while also recognising that small interests in providers of communications media may be held.<\/p><p>I understand the intention behind amendment No. 49 in seeking to broaden the definition of \"relevant interest\" to encompass social media accounts.  However, regarding the core principle of ensuring commissioners or connected persons do not derive benefits from the providers of communications media, I believe section 12(13)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, achieves this by limiting the value of any benefits that may be received by a commissioner, connected person or staff member of the coimisi&uacute;n from a provider of communications media to &euro;650.  This would also apply to income derived from the monetisation of a social media account, for example.<\/p><p>Although the Senator said amendment No. 49 was really raised for debate, I worry it could give rise to unintended consequences whereby a commissioner could be removed from office through no fault of his or her own as a result of this provision.  For example, an ill-intentioned person or entity could purchase a large quantity of fake followers in respect of a commissioner or connected person with the intention of causing a commissioner to exceed the threshold of 20,000 followers.  Regarding amendment No. 49, as we discussed regarding amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 41, the Bill will be amended to provide for an online safety commissioner who will be appointed to oversee the making of online safety codes and applying them to designated online services.  I am conscious that this will be a demanding role and one that is likely to be controversial.  I am worried that the amendment would pose a particular risk for the online safety commissioner given the role at the forefront of regulating designated online services.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 50, which I will not be accepting, has the same effect as amendments Nos. 44 and 52, which we have discussed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#DD00700","speaker":"1471","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 47:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 24, lines 26 and 27, to delete &quot;, where their aggregate value exceeds &euro;13,000&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#EE00400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 48:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 24, lines 30 and 31, to delete &quot;, where their aggregate value exceeds &euro;650&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#EE00600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 49:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 24, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(e) has an active personal account on a designated online service with in excess of 20,000 followers or subscribers.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#EE00800","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 50:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 26, to delete line 6. <\/blockquote> <p>I am not sure why this amendment was grouped with the others, because it relates to the local authority issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#EE01000","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 51 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 52:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 27, to delete line 18. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#EE01300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1651138200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 53:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 29, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:   \t&quot;(6A) All members of a committee established by the Commission shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be subject to the same requirements to disclose interests under section 37.&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 53 inserts a subsection providing that, for the avoidance of doubt, members of a committee established by the commission shall be subject to the same obligations to declare interests and recuse themselves from certain deliberations under section 37.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042800002#EE01500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1651138200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>This came up in the climate Bill and the change was made in respect of that Bill.

This is a broad obligation that requires the person in question to disclose interests relating to any organisation that may derive a benefit from any matter being considered by the coimisi&uacute;n and to recuse himself or herself from any discussions or decisions regarding the matter in question.
