That package is designed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a country with a top tier business environment is underpinned by a robust framework to combat corporate, economic and regulatory offences. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has lead responsibility for delivery of 4 of the measures, all of which include the preparation of new legislation. <\/p>  <p>  One of the key measures in the Government&rsquo;s programme is the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as an agency that is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. Giving effect to this decision requires new primary legislation to amend the Companies Act 2014.\u00a0 Accordingly, a General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill was published on 4 December 2018. That Scheme has been submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation for its consideration for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny. Subject to the outcome of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, the General Scheme is to be drafted as a priority, with a view to publication this year. <\/p>  <p>  Another measure in the Government&rsquo;s programme to tackle &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo; is to examine the Company Law Review Group&rsquo;s Report on Corporate Governance and to bring forward proposals, including for legislative change. My Department reviewed the CLRG&rsquo;s recommendations last year and, as a result, proposals for legislative change are included in Part 4 of the General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill.\u00a0 These are intended to clarify certain corporate governance and other issues affecting the administration of company meetings. <\/p>  <p>  The third measure assigned to the Department is the transposition of the Shareholders Rights Directive (Directive 2017\/828). This Directive establishes specific requirements to encourage long term shareholder engagement and increase corporate transparency. Draft Regulations to give effect to this commitment were submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel last November and my Department is engaged with that Office on the drafting and settlement of those Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the package of measures includes a commitment to enact the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017. Again, my Department worked with the Parliamentary Counsel on the preparation of that Bill and the drafting of amendments to enhance the oversight and supervisory powers of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.\u00a0 The Bill was enacted as the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018 in July 2018 and virtually all sections were commenced in September 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100046#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100046#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[4440\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100046#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps being taken by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to promote job creation in County Sligo; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>Since my appointment as\u00a0Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made regional development, enterprise and\u00a0sustainable jobs growth my top priorities.\u00a0I am pleased that we are making progress across all regions, including Sligo and the North West region.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Plans are crucial in meeting the Government's ambition to create an additional 200,00 jobs, of which 135,000 are outside the Dublin region, by 2020.

I am focused on both supporting and sustaining current regional employers and working to create new economic and job opportunities across the country. The recent performance of IDA Ireland, the State Agency tasked with promoting inward investment into Ireland, demonstrates the progress we are making in this context. By the end of last year, total employment in the IDA&rsquo;s client companies stood at 229,057, the highest on record. Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across\u00a0681 firms\u00a0in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. I am determined, together with the IDA, to see this trend continue and we will be doing everything possible in 2019 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Donegal has benefitted from this strong regional focus. The County has experienced a 60% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2012, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 2,223 in 2012 to 3,564 at the end of last year. In 2018 alone, the total of IDA supported jobs in Donegal increased by 5%, with the County now home to 12 IDA companies including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica. <\/p>  <p>  As regards new-name investors, the general trend is reasonably positive especially in the context of the strong performance of the IDA clients already located in Donegal.\u00a0 There was 1 new name investment in 2009 in Donegal\u00a0representing 2.5% of the national total in that year.\u00a0 In 2010 there were no new name investments in the County.\u00a0 In 2011 there was one new investment out of a total of 61\u00a0such investments nationally, giving a percentage of 1.6%\u00a0of national new name investment.\u00a0 In 2012 there was also one new investment in Donegal out of 65 nationally, which is 1.5% of the total figure.\u00a0\u00a0Between 2013 and 2018 there has been no new name\u00a0investments in\u00a0County\u00a0Donegal.\u00a0Those statistics, however,\u00a0only serve to emphasise that FDI performance is not accurately measured by the number of new-name investors, given Donegal&rsquo;s strong performance &ndash; as outlined above &ndash; over the last decade.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the year ahead, the indications are that FDI in Donegal\u00a0will continue to increase.

In 2018, for example, 56% of all net new jobs created by the Agency were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin.

The IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and\u00a0Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector.\u00a0County Meath is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region,\u00a0with a focus on building\u00a0clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that\u00a0FDI\u00a0only forms one part of investment in regional locations.

Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as\u00a0of 18 January 2018, 419 LEO clients were\u00a0approved assistance under the grant. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.\u00a0The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  In December, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). <\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. \u00a0The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.\u00a0 Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.\u00a0 The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.<\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any\u00a0Brexit scenario. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100046#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Development","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100046#WRA04300"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[4432\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100046#WRA04400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on whether the EU regional aid status of Kells and north County Meath granted in 2014 has had a positive impact in terms of local investment or incentives and grants to encourage employers to locate in the area; her views on whether enough has been done to promote Kells and north County Meath as a location for investment and business development; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>Regional development remains an absolute priority of mine.

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures inresponse to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI) as part of Budget 2019. ITI works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. <\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report and the end of November 2018, 811 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 657 have been approved.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 471 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as of 18 January 2018, 419 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). <\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Over 3,900 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 155 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 165 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics.<\/p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. <\/p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on 30 November 2018, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.<\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":32,"qnumall":"[4591\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the position regarding the assistance available to businesses that wish to sell online to compete in the growing online market; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>All businesses, regardless of size or sector, in today&rsquo;s competitive environment must ensure to build their digital online capability. The agencies of the Department offer a range of supports to assist businesses to trade online.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop front line service assisting in delivering business growth and jobs for the small &amp;amp; micro-enterprise sector. The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support. The LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete in the online market place.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with\u00a0training and advice, to micro\u00a0companies (10\u00a0or less employees)\u00a0who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity. Since the start of the Scheme in July 2014 to date almost 4,500 micro companies have availed of the TOVS.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as: <\/p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online\/mobile marketing strategy;<\/p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the\u00a0majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business;<\/p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits\u00a0into sales; and<\/p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video\u00a0optimization for web.<\/p>  <p>  As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability so as to expand their market reach nationally and internationally,\u00a0and enhance their competitiveness. In 2017, data from the CSO showed that 66% of Irish enterprises in the Wholesale and Retail Sector reported having a website or homepage, with only 28% able to facilitate online ordering. <\/p>  <p>  In support of this,\u00a0I have introduced a\u00a0new pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland, the first call of which opened on 24 October 2018 and closed on 5 December 2018. Applications are currently under assessment by Enterprise Ireland. The Online Retail Scheme will support retail businesses of 20 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. Eligible expenditure under the Scheme includes activities such as\u00a0research, strategy development, implementation and training. The Scheme launched with a fund of up to &euro;625,000, which was later doubled to &euro;1.25m as part of\u00a0the Department&rsquo;s 2019 Budget. A second call will issue this year (2019).<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the strong role the retail sector plays in supporting regional development and vibrant communities, at least 50% of the total number of grants awarded under the Scheme will be\u00a0prioritised for retail SMEs with their headquarters outside of county Dublin, subject to applications meeting the minimum standards required.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, and building an online presence is part of the range of supports offered to those clients. EI has supported projects focused on developing innovative products on new product platforms for international markets.\u00a0Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, EI delivers a range of funded and advisory eCommerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities. In addition, EI regularly organises events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice.<\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1.8m has been earmarked for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over the next 3 years. The proposed investment, again via EI, is to assist the sector to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increasing market diversification by client companies and underpinning sustainable growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":69,"content":"<p>Question No. 33 answered with Question No. 31.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[4590\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the way in which she will interact with D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to ensure that the elements of the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill that relate to her brief are adequately debated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>On 19 December 2018, the Government published our Contingency Action Plan, which outlines our approach to No-Deal Brexit planning.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, as part of the Brexit Contingency Action Plan, Government published the general scheme of a Bill\u00a0that will be necessary in the event of a No Deal Brexit.

We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period, that is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created.<\/p>  <p>  To enhance the potential for enterprise development in the regions, and to add value to the core work of the enterprise agencies within the regions, I will shortly be launching nine new Regional Enterprise Plans which succeed the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) 2015-2017 initiative. The refresh and refocus of the RAPJs through these new Plans will ensure that through further collaborative initiatives we can enhance the attractiveness of regional locations for new investment and entrepreneurship and drive the creation of jobs of quality that are sustainable in the long term. The new Plans are also an essential element to strengthen the resilience of regions and regional enterprise in the face of new challenges, including Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Strategic investments within the overarching national context, through Project Ireland 2040 are also key to ensuring each region can contribute to, and participate in Ireland&rsquo;s future national growth, and sustain a higher standard of living over the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to specific measures to attract more indigenous business to locate in regional areas, Enterprise Ireland provides advice and\u00a0support to indigenous companies in every county, in urban and rural areas of Ireland, to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets, now and in the future. In addition, through the network of Local Enterprise Offices, Enterprise Ireland plays a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate Strategy &ldquo;Build Scale Expand Reach 2017-2020&rdquo; places the regions at the core of economic growth in Ireland. The strategy sets ambitious targets to sustain 200,000 existing jobs and to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and is founded on four core objectives:<\/p>  <p>  - To maximise growth of Enterprise Ireland clients in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  - To strengthen Regional Infrastructure to maximise future growth of Irish Enterprise in the Regions<\/p>  <p>  - To support Entrepreneurship in the Regions<\/p>  <p>  - Work in collaboration to deliver Regional Growth.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 215,207 people. During that year, 18,846 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,119 jobs. Enterprise Ireland supported companies are estimated to sustain over 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. Of the new jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2018, 61% were created outside of Dublin, and currently, 64% of all Enterprise Ireland supported employment is located outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies through a network of market and sector advisers from nine offices located throughout the country. Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies throughout the country via teams of sectoral focused development advisors using a company-led diagnostic approach which is used to establish clients&rsquo; business needs. Based on this, the agency can tailor a support package to a company&rsquo;s stage of growth and level of ambition. A support package focuses, where relevant, on six business pillars (Innovation, Finance, Operations, Sales and Marketing, People and Organisational Development). <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that there is an ecosystem to support and sustain enterprises in regions is essential for regional enterprise development. To assist with balanced regional enterprise growth, Enterprise Ireland has, for example,<\/p>  <p>  - Invested &euro;60 million in 42 projects to support regions across the country to build capability in key sectors under the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund. All regions have been supported under this competitive fund.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased the number of accelerators operating in the Irish market to support entrepreneurship and job creation under the 2015 - 2017 Accelerator Development Scheme,\u00a0including funding to 4 Regional Accelerators.<\/p>  <p>  - Up to January 2019, has supported 38 companies through the EI Competitive Start Fund (CSF) which is targeting a range of areas of focus, such as international entrepreneurs, graduates, fintech, agritech and female entrepreneurs.<\/p>  <p>  - Up to October 2018, supported 171 entrepreneurs on the New Frontiers programme which is EI&rsquo;s national entrepreneur development programme for innovative, early-stage start-ups,\u00a0run in the 14 Institutes of Technology and two participating Universities across the country.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also supports client companies in regions around the country navigate the uncertainty of Brexit and has engaged in a programme of building resilience in Irish exporting companies focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness; and addressing the awareness and preparedness of companies to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  As regards attracting Foreign Direct Investment,\u00a0IDA Ireland's\u00a0performance in 2018 resulted in the\u00a0sixth consecutive year of strong growth under the Agency's current strategy. By the end of last year, total employment in the Agency's client companies stood at 229,057.<\/p>  <p>  Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across\u00a0681 firms\u00a0in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. 56% of all net new\u00a0FDI\u00a0jobs created last year were based in regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy, 407 Investments have been won for the regions and almost 27,000 net jobs have been added on the ground in locations outside Dublin. In addition, 58% of all IDA supported employment is now located outside of Dublin. This represents\u00a0the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  The year 2018 saw more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years.\u00a0There have been a number of positive FDI announcements in regional locations during 2018 such as:<\/p>  <p>  - 600 jobs at Edwards Lifesciences in Limerick (March).<\/p>  <p>  - 400 jobs at Wuxi, Dundalk and an investment &euro;325m (April).<\/p>  <p>  - 500 jobs at Abbott in Donegal (July)<\/p>  <p>  - 200 jobs at Leetha Industries, Longford (May).<\/p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Jaguar LandRover, Shannon (January).<\/p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Phibro Health, Sligo (July).<\/p>  <p>  Attracting FDI to regional areas is not without its challenges. That is largely because there is a global trend to base FDI around large urban areas where there is, for example, ready access to transport hubs and networks. Companies may also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP)\u00a0remains an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin.\u00a0 Budget 2019 saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the RPP on top of the &euro;150 m for the RPP launched in 2015. This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions. The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Action Plan for Jobs","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB04000"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[4442\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100047#WRB04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"when the new regional enterprise plans will be launched; the benefits this will have for the midlands region; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>In April 2018, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020.<\/p><p>The refresh and refocus of the Plans will ensure that they remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in every region, and can be robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit.<\/p><p>The outcomes of this refresh are nine new Regional Enterprise Plans that are focused on a smaller number of Strategic Objectives with time-bound actions to 2020.<\/p><p>As a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; initiative, the Plans complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and so\u00a0there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed,\u00a0the forthcoming Future Jobs Ireland initiative and Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>I intend to launch the Plans at nine separate regional events over the coming weeks, in the following locations:<table><tr><th>Region<\/th><th>Date<\/th><th>Venue<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Midlands<\/td><td>6th February<\/td><td>Mountmellick,\u00a0Laois<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mid-East<\/td><td>7th\u00a0February<\/td><td>Naas,\u00a0Kildare<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>West<\/td><td>11th\u00a0February<\/td><td>Galway\u00a0City, Galway<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>14th\u00a0February (TBC)<\/td><td>Dublin\u00a0City, Dublin<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mid-West<\/td><td>20th   February<\/td><td>Lisheen,\u00a0Tipperary<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North-West<\/td><td>25th\u00a0February<\/td><td>Leitrim<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>North-East<\/td><td>25th\u00a0February<\/td><td>Cavan<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South-West<\/td><td>1st\u00a0March<\/td><td>Skibbereen, Cork<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South-East<\/td><td>22nd\u00a0March<\/td><td>WIT,\u00a0Waterford<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In relation to job creation, the 2020 targets initially set out under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (2015 &ndash; 2017) remain in place &ndash; that is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the State average.\u00a0<\/p><p>I\u00a0also\u00a0want to ensure that the jobs that are being created are of good quality and sustainable in the longer term, in line with our Future Jobs Ireland objective. <\/p><p>The Midlands has shown excellent progress in employment levels since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, with an employment growth rate\u00a0from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018 of 17.7%, which\u00a0exceeds the\u00a010 &ndash; 15%\u00a0 targeted to 2020 . <\/p><p>However, the Midlands unemployment rate is more than one percentage point above the State average currently so more work needs to be done.<\/p><p>The Strategic Objectives and actions in the Midlands Plan are set out alongside the Enterprise Agencies&rsquo; (EI, IDA, LEOs) core activities.

While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they quickly developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.<\/p>  <p>  President Omar al-Bashir reacted by closing schools and declaring a state of emergency in some regions.  Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds.  It is reported that almost 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began. The Sudanese Government has said that 30 people have been killed during demonstrations, while Sudanese activists and medical workers say that the number killed is at least 45.  The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU's 24 December 2018 call on the Government of Sudan to exercise restraint, respect the right to peaceful protest and ensure that all law enforcement and security bodies act under its direct control and in accordance with Sudan's constitutional and international commitments.  Ireland also stands fully behind the EU statement of 11 January 2019 which calls on the Government of Sudan to release all journalists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained, and to guarantee the independence of the Investigation Committee tasked with the investigation of abuses.  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, driven by protracted conflicts, inequality and climate change.  These feed into the popular disaffection leading to protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children.  Ireland is responding to these crises, with almost &euro;26 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100048#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Representation","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100048#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[4911\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100048#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if consideration is being given to appointing an Irish consul in Guinea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The Embassy of Ireland in Sierra Leone is accredited on a non-residential basis to Guinea.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular types of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance.  What was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.  Building upon the work undertaken in the completion of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, the second phase of the CIWG culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out, set out in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.  <\/p>  <p>  The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:<\/p>  <p>  - Increase Transparency:  enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes,<\/p>  <p>  - Review the level of damages in personal injury cases: request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, and<\/p>  <p>  - Improve the personal injuries litigation framework: through a number of measures, namely:<\/p>  <p>  a. ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy;<\/p>  <p>  b. tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and<\/p>  <p>  c. ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare updates on its progress.  The most recent such update was published in November 2018 and shows that of the 19 actions from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance with deadlines up to and including Q3 2018, 18 have been completed.  It is envisaged that the next Progress Update will be completed by the end of February.

Under the procedures, the Board of Management must also ensure that the school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy is regularly highlighted and promoted on a school wide basis with particular attention given to incoming pupils and their parents.<\/p>  <p>  The Board of Management must ensure that the school has clear procedures for the formal noting and reporting of bullying behaviour and these must be documented in the schools&rsquo; anti-bullying policy. A pupil or parent may bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school.  Individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy.  <\/p>  <p>  It is not a requirement that a teacher must witness an act of bullying before the school can determine bullying to have occurred. In the procedures the member of teaching staff who has responsibility for investigating and dealing with bullying is referred to as the &ldquo;relevant teacher&rdquo;. If it is established by the relevant teacher that bullying has occurred, the relevant teacher must keep appropriate written records which will assist his or her efforts to resolve the issues.  All reports including anonymous reports of bullying must be investigated and dealt with by the relevant teacher. Non-teaching staff such as secretaries, special needs assistants (SNAs), bus escorts, caretakers and cleaners must be encouraged to report any incidents of bullying behaviour witnessed by them, or mentioned to them, to the relevant teacher. <\/p>  <p>  The procedures include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti - bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, as part of its inspection work, is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100049#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Management","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100049#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[4765\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100049#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if it is within the power of a board of management of a public school to change or reverse a decision made by a previous board of management; the conditions under which such a change can be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":203,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Education Act, 1998 the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school and the Board is accountable to the school Patron.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#00201F\">Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations. The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#00201F\">I have been informed by the Commissioner that a new &ldquo;Community Policing Framework&rdquo; is currently at an advanced stage. I understand that under this new Framework which will take into account the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it is envisaged that Community policing may be a specialism in some urban areas. In rural areas, it may be more of a hybrid model where all Garda&iacute; in a District have a community responsibility but also having to attend normal policing duties.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#00201F\">Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. This accelerated recruitment of Garda&iacute; saw Garda numbers reach just over 14,000 by the end of 2018. Furthermore, a total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility in both rural and urban communities <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#00201F\">The Garda Commissioner has informed me that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilians).

I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities.

The proposed legislation in relation to the appointment of a Digital Safety Commissioner is being dealt with by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.<\/p>  <p>  It also proposed significant reform in the area of the criminal law and it was intended that my Department would bring forward legislation to give effect to the criminal law aspects of the report. However, due to competing legislative priorities, progress was not as rapid as I had hoped. In 2017, Deputy Brendan Howlin introduced a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 to the D&aacute;il. It completed second stage in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government. Cabinet approval was recently given to discontinue work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill to ensure that legislation can be enacted as swiftly as possible. The main provisions of the Bill as published include:<\/p>  <p>  - The existing offence of sending false, threatening, indecent or obscene messages will be extended. At present, it applies to communication by telephone or sms messaging but the new offence proposed will apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages sent persistently using any form of online or traditional method of communications. <\/p>  <p>  - Two new offences relating to non-consensual distribution of intimate images with\/without intent to cause harm or distress (generally referred to as &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;). Whether the person against whom the offence was committed is underage or unable to guard themselves from harm is intended to be an aggravating factor to be considered in sentencing for the offence of non-consensual distribution of an image. <\/p>  <p>  - The existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 will be extended to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications and will include communication to, or about a person.  <\/p>  <p>  - A new stalking offence. <\/p>  <p>  Department officials have been working with Deputy Howlin with the intention of identifying and bringing forward any necessary Government amendments to ensure the Bill can be as robust and effective as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Legislative reform is one of the actions under the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019, which was launched by the Taoiseach in July last year and is currently being implemented.

I am hopeful that further investors can be encouraged to situate in the County, whether at these sites or others, and thereby contribute further to the wider region's growth and development. <\/p>  <p>  Whilst the IDA is doing everything within its power to ensure its clients locate outside the country&rsquo;s principal urban areas, attracting\u00a0foreign direct investment (FDI)\u00a0to the regions is not without its challenges. Many overseas firms, for example, will only consider large cities for a variety of operational and commercial\u00a0reasons.<\/p>  <p>  I am nevertheless pleased to say that FDI in County Wexford has exhibited strong growth in recent years. I\u00a0understand that there are 18 IDA client companies\u00a0now located there,\u00a0employing a total of\u00a03,139 people.\u00a0There has been a 6.5% increase in IDA supported employment in the County from 2017 to 2018. Moreover,\u00a0Wexford has seen a\u00a025% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2013. It should also be noted that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  While the employment trends in Wexford are positive, I recognise that there is room for improvement\u00a0in the County. I am working hard, together\u00a0with my colleagues across Government, to further unlock\u00a0its economic potential\u00a0and thereby create more jobs\u00a0and opportunities for the people of the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100050#WRE05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research Funding Data","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100050#WRE06000"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[4766\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100050#WRE06100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount expended here as a percentage of GNP on research spending in each of the years 2010 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>The table shows Ireland's Gross Expenditure on R&amp;amp;D (GERD) and GERD as a percentage of GNP for 2010 to 2017.

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign, including a recent event held in Monaghan in October\u00a0where I\u00a0was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.\u00a0Last week, the Revenue Commissioners\u00a0held a seminar in Dundalk. The seminar focused on customs requirements, procedures and operation of the UK landbridge and transit arrangements. This week the NSAI is hosting Brexit events in Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo and further events are in planning by my Department and agencies.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures in response to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI) as part of Budget 2019. ITI\u00a0works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. <\/p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs continue to organize various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition,\u00a0471 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as\u00a0of 18 January 2018, 419 LEO clients were\u00a0approved assistance under the grant. Also, i have provided additional capital funding of &euro;5 million\u00a0in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.\u00a0The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). <\/p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. \u00a0The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.\u00a0 Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. <\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.\u00a0 The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Over 3,900 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 155 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 165 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics.<\/p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. <\/p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies\u00a0participated in all six\u00a0Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in 2018, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA. <\/p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any\u00a0Brexit scenario. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100050#WRE06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100050#WRE06900"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[4924\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100050#WRE07000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she expects to be in a position to improve conditions for business and enterprise with particular reference to the extent to which  industry can be supported in its competition throughout the sector in view of the changes taking place globally; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>As a small open economy, Ireland has always been exposed to factors beyond our control, impacting on our ability to prosper, and the global economic landscape is becoming more, not less, challenging to Ireland&rsquo;s growth prospects. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2019, the IMF revised down their projections for global economic growth over the next two years, with growth projected to be 3.5% in 2019 and 3.6% in 2020. The growth forecast had already been revised downwards (partly because of the negative effects of tariff increases enacted by the United State and China).

An escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook.

We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.<\/p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period, that is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created.<\/p>  <p>  To enhance the potential for enterprise development in the regions, and to add value to the core work of the enterprise agencies within the regions, I will shortly be launching nine new Regional Enterprise Plans which succeed the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) 2015-2017 initiative. The refresh and refocus of the RAPJs through these new Plans will ensure that through further collaborative initiatives we can enhance the attractiveness of regional locations for new investment and entrepreneurship and drive the creation of jobs of quality that are sustainable in the long term. The new Plans are also an essential element to strengthen the resilience of regions and regional enterprise in the face of new challenges, including Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Strategic investments within the overarching national context, through Project Ireland 2040 are also key to ensuring each region can contribute to, and participate in Ireland&rsquo;s future national growth, and sustain a higher standard of living over the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to specific measures to encourage and foster job opportunities throughout the regions, Enterprise Ireland provides advice and\u00a0support to indigenous companies in every county, in urban and rural areas of Ireland, to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets, now and in the future. In addition, through the network of Local Enterprise Offices in every county in Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with the Local Authorities,\u00a0plays a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate Strategy &ldquo;Build Scale Expand Reach 2017-2020&rdquo; places the regions at the core of economic growth in Ireland. The strategy sets ambitious targets to sustain 200,000 existing jobs and to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and is founded on four core objectives:<\/p>  <p>  - To maximise growth of Enterprise Ireland\u00a0clients in the regions.<\/p>  <p>  - To strengthen Regional Infrastructure to maximise future growth of Irish Enterprise in the Regions<\/p>  <p>  - To support Entrepreneurship in the Regions<\/p>  <p>  - Work in collaboration to deliver Regional\u00a0Growth<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 215,207 people. During that year, 18,846 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,119 jobs. Enterprise Ireland supported companies are estimated to sustain over 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. Of the new jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2018, 61% were created outside of Dublin, and currently, 64% of all Enterprise Ireland supported employment is located outside of Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies through a network of market and sector advisers from nine offices located throughout the country. Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies throughout the country via teams of sectoral focused development advisors using a company-led diagnostic approach which is used to establish clients&rsquo; business needs. Based on this, the agency can tailor a support package to a company&rsquo;s stage of growth and level of ambition. A support package focuses, where relevant, on six business pillars (Innovation, Finance, Operations, Sales and Marketing, People and Organisational Development). <\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that there is an ecosystem to support and sustain enterprises in regions is essential for regional enterprise development and job creation. To assist with balanced regional enterprise growth, Enterprise Ireland initiatives include, for example,<\/p>  <p>  - Investing &euro;60 million in 42 projects to support regions across the country to build capability in key sectors under the\u00a0competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund. All regions are being\u00a0supported under this competitive fund.<\/p>  <p>  - Increased the number of accelerators operating\u00a0in the Irish market to support entrepreneurship and job creation under the\u00a02015 - 2017 Accelerator Development Scheme,\u00a0including funding to 4\u00a0Regional Accelerators.<\/p>  <p>  - Up to January 2019, EI has supported 38 companies\u00a0through the EI Competitive Start Fund (CSF) which is targeting a range of\u00a0areas of focus, such as international entrepreneurs, graduates, fintech,\u00a0agritech and female entrepreneurs.<\/p>  <p>  - Up to October 2018, EI supported 171\u00a0entrepreneurs on the New Frontiers programme which is EI&rsquo;s national\u00a0entrepreneur development programme for innovative, early-stage\u00a0start-ups,\u00a0run in the 14 Institutes of Technology and two participating Universities across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also supports client companies in regions around the country navigate the uncertainty of Brexit and has engaged in a programme of building resilience in Irish exporting companies focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness; and addressing the awareness and preparedness of companies to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  As regards attracting Foreign Direct Investment,\u00a0IDA Ireland's\u00a0performance in 2018 resulted in the\u00a0sixth consecutive year of strong growth under the Agency's current strategy. By the end of last year, total employment in the Agency's client companies stood at 229,057.<\/p>  <p>  Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across\u00a0681 firms\u00a0in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. 56% of all net new\u00a0FDI\u00a0jobs created last year were based in regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy, 407 Investments have been won for the regions and almost 27,000 net jobs have been added on the ground in locations outside Dublin. In addition, 58% of all IDA supported employment is now located outside of Dublin. This represents\u00a0the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  The year 2018 saw more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years.\u00a0There have been a number of positive FDI announcements in regional locations during 2018 such as:<\/p>  <p>  - 600 jobs at Edwards Lifesciences in Limerick\u00a0(March).<\/p>  <p>  - 400 jobs at Wuxi, Dundalk and an investment\u00a0&euro;325m (April).<\/p>  <p>  - 500 jobs at Abbott in Donegal (July)<\/p>  <p>  - 200 jobs at Leetha Industries, Longford (May).<\/p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Jaguar LandRover, Shannon\u00a0(January).<\/p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Phibro Health, Sligo (July).<\/p>  <p>  Attracting to FDI to regional areas is not without its challenges. That&rsquo;s largely because there is a global trend to base FDI around large urban areas where there is, for example, ready access to transport hubs and networks. Companies may also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP)\u00a0remains an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin.\u00a0 Budget 2019 saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the RPP on top of the &euro;150 m for the RPP launched in 2015. This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions. The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Preparations","counter":330,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":331,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[4928\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she expects to be in a position to combat the effects of Brexit in respect of exports to the UK in the food and service sectors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":332,"content":"<p>The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets. The agencies under my Department have a wide range of supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies to build on the strength of their 2018 performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan for Brexit so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  The Agency has assisted client companies to increase their exports to a record &euro;22.71 billion in 2017, a growth of 7% compared to 2016&rsquo;s exporting results. The UK market accounted for 34% of total exports, an increase of 4% on 2016 exporting figures.<\/p>  <p>  The UK is the leading exporting destination for Enterprise Ireland supported companies and is the first export destination for many companies. Despite this, Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food companies, are increasingly diversifying their global footprint beyond the UK. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets.<\/p>  <p>  While Brexit presents an economy wide challenge, a number of exporting sectors are highly exposed to Brexit. In 2017, 1,574 client companies reported exports into the UK. Of this, a group of over 640 are highly exposed to Brexit and predominately span 6 sectors (construction services, construction products, engineering, agriculture machinery, timber, furniture and food). Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with this group to ensure that sustainability and growth plans are developed in line with the agency&rsquo;s remit.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. Recently launched EI supports including online Customs Training and Act On Consultancy.\u00a0 Later in February, it is planned that the Local Enterprise Offices will be launching their customs training offering which will be available to all companies.\u00a0 Furthermore, the suite of enterprise supports in place cover a range of potential Brexit impacts.\u00a0 These range from liquidity support through short term and longer term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties, including an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Schemes in place to deal with sudden shocks and an expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  While many businesses have taken preparedness actions, a number have yet to do so. It is vital that businesses prepare themselves for Brexit impacts and take actions to mitigate. Firms that do business with the UK, whether buying goods or exporting products, should examine their supply chains to determine their vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[4929\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she continues to assist small and medium enterprises; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>My Department and I are fully committed to the continued growth and development of our small and medium indigenous enterprises.

A selection of these supports includes:<\/p>  <p>  - The Brexit Loan Scheme launched in March 2018, is a &euro;300 million loan fund offering affordable working capital to eligible Irish businesses with up to 499 employees, allowing them to innovate, change or adapt in response to challenges posed by Brexit,<\/p>  <p>  - My Department&rsquo;s online tool Supportingsmes.ie, directs small businesses to the most relevant State supports out of the 170 available,<\/p>  <p>  - New Frontiers is a national entrepreneur development programme delivered locally through the Institutes of Technology (IoT&rsquo;s) and funded by Enterprise Ireland,<\/p>  <p>  - Technology Centres are public-private research centres of excellence that connect industry to the third level sector to increase the generation and availability of new, industrially relevant knowledge,<\/p>  <p>  - The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs)\u00a0located nationwide offer a range of financial supports to assist with the establishment and growth of micro-enterprises, and<\/p>  <p>  - The LEOs also offer soft supports in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); provide a mentor to work with the business proposer; support micro enterprises in their loan applications to Micro Finance Ireland; and promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated an extra &euro;14m to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.As part of the increase to my Department for 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to enhance our Global Footprint. This will help companies to diversify into new markets as the UK leaves the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices are present in every single county in Ireland and provide crucial supports for SMEs and start ups throughout the country. This year I allocated an additional &euro;5m which is an increase of 22% on 2018. This extra funding will help deliver supports to more SMEs, particularly in the current changing landscape.<\/p>  <p>  I also announced, as part of Budget 2019, a longer term loan facility, the Future Growth Scheme, of up to &euro;300m to support capital investment by business, which is a collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine,\u00a0the Department of Finance, the European Investment Bank Group and SBCI.<\/p>  <p>  A specific focus is being given to helping Irish SMEs grow their international sales, diversify their markets and secure new investments in Ireland. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. Last year, we launched the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme.\u00a0 This scheme offers competitively priced loans to eligible businesses that require short-term finance to overcome the impacts of Brexit.

I am ensuring that my Department is at the forefront in the provision of supports and programmes to assist women to lead businesses, whether they are established businesses or new businesses. <\/p>  <p>  Women make up more than half the population in Ireland. However, women are less likely to work or run their own business. The ERSI 2016 report &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Economic outlook perspectives and policy challenges&rdquo; report highlights that the female labour market participation rate is 52.8%, whereas the male participation rate is 68.5% (2011-15). The CSO statistics show that women make up 60% of the inactive population, i.e. those not in the work force.<\/p>  <p>  This report indicates that female labour market participation has remained relatively robust during the recession, falling by just over one percentage point in the 2011-2015 period compared to the 2006-2010 period. The baseline projections from the ERSI are for participation rates to rise over the coming years. Female participation rate is projected to continue the upward trend that was interrupted by the crisis and rise to over 58 per cent over the next ten years.<\/p>  <p>  I want to encourage more women to join the workforce but more importantly to lead the workforce. To assist women into taking the helm of enterprises, the Government must lead by example. Through a concerted effort throughout departments and agencies, the participation by women on State boards has increased over the last few years to 41 per cent. Unfortunately, female representation on corporate boards is lagging far behind. Women currently make up just 18.1 percent of directors of Irish-registered ISEQ20 companies, which is significantly lower than the EU average of 26.2 percent for large publicly-listed companies. That is why the Better Balance for Better Business initiative was launched at an event in Government Buildings in July last year.<\/p>  <p>  The review group will examine the gender mix at the governance and senior management levels in companies, as well as the issues that arise in connection with the appointment of directors and senior management. Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of my Department, is one of the leaders on this group alongside Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland and Julie Sinnamon, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland. It will engage with companies to make the case for change and will report annually on its progress.<\/p>  <p>  Another method to encourage more businesses in Ireland to be led by women is to have businesses start with women at the helm. The 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Ireland data suggest a persistent gender divide in Ireland in the business startup rate in Ireland. A gender divide is evident in most countries. The 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report for Ireland indicates that the gender gap between male and female early stage entrepreneurs is 2:1. This reflects a continued narrowing of the margins since 2014 where it stood at 2.5 male to 1 female. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is leading the way in providing a variety of programmes through its agencies to increase the number of women starting businesses and assisting them at every stage, from potential business leaders to women growing their businesses. My Department published the first National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement in 2014. Action 19 of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have been at the forefront of examining the variance in the female to male ratio of start-ups and have put in place measures to address the imbalance. The Competitive Start Fund (CSF) for Female Entrepreneurs aims to support early stage start-ups.\u00a0 The establishment of this programme has resulted in a spill-over effect with increased female participation in other EI programmes. In 2012, just eight percent of the 97 High-Potential Start Ups (HPSUs) were female-led. However, 22% of HPSU approvals went to female-led companies in 2018 and 22% of CSF approvals were for companies led by female entrepreneurs.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also partners with key providers in providing training and capability development for early stage and establishes entrepreneurs.\u00a0 It developed and supported a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers.\u00a0 These included:<\/p>  <p>  - Going for Growth,<\/p>  <p>  - DCU Ryan Academy Female Propeller Programme,<\/p>  <p>  - NDRC Female Founders Programme, and<\/p>  <p>  - CIT Female Exxcel Programme.<\/p>  <p>  - The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks. An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs and women operating established businesses.<\/p>  <p>  - We have seen progress in the numbers of women availing of many of the Services provided by the LEOs. For example, in 2017, 57% of participants attending core training programme, such as Start Your Own Business, were female.<\/p>  <p>  - From these actions and supports, it is evident that my Department has a strong focus on supporting female led enterprises. I want to see the numbers of these businesses increase for the betterment of the business environment and for society in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[4850\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be no delay to a primary care centre (details supplied) in Dublin 12 in view of the new national children's hospital budget overrun.","asker":"1306","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is currently developing its Capital Plan for 2019.

At a European level EU legislation provides for freedom of movement of professions, including doctors, among Member States. The Medical Council is the statutory body regulating medical doctors ensuring compliance with the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Medical Council and medical practitioners are legally bound by the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and must comply with the Act.  Part 6 of the Act provides for the registration of medical practitioners.  The Medical Council registers eligible medical practitioners in the appropriate Division of the Register, on fulfilling the application requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The  Medical Practitioners Act 2007 introduced a very significant change in the regulatory model for the medical profession in Ireland, providing for an enhanced and modern system of regulation. It ensures the protection of the public as the Act states that the object of the Medical Council is to protect the public by promoting and better ensuring high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registered medical practitioners. Another reform in the Act was the change to membership of the Council in order to provide for a non-medical majority on the Council. It is comprised of 13 non-medical members and 12 medical members. Medical practitioners work with other people of standing and expertise on the Council to advance the interests of patients and the public. <\/p>  <p>   A key responsibility of the Medical Council is to investigate complaints against medical doctors.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the 2007 Act, Fitness to Practice hearings were heard in private. Since the commencement of the Act, a hearing before the Fitness to Practice Committee, which are established to inquire into a complaint, are held in public generally except in some circumstances as set out in the 2007 Act.  In addition to this the Act requires that the majority of the membership of the Fitness to Practice Committee shall consist of persons who are not medical practitioners. <\/p>  <p>   The 2007 Act also introduced the requirement for all registered doctors to comply and maintain professional competence.<\/p>  <p>   At the end of 2018 there were 22,996 doctors registered with the Medical Council.  In 2018 there were 396 complaints received against doctors.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view that the Medical Council is an effective regulatory body under the aegis of my Department. The significant changes brought about in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 reformed the regulation of medical doctors in Ireland to ensure there is no self regulation and to protect the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Data","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[4711\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of assaults recorded against psychiatric nurses in each of the years 2011 to 2018, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treatment Purchase Fund","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[4715\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way in which patients are selected for referral via the NTPF to private hospitals for treatment with specific reference to a hospital (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>The role of the NTPF is to authorise public hospitals to offer outsourced treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient\/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant\/specialist at an outpatient clinic.

HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.<\/p><p>HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards. In addition, it undertakes functions in relation to Health Information and Health Technology Assessment.<\/p><p>The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards. In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012, which has resulted in the publication of over 300 reports of inspection visits to date. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety.<\/p><p>In such cases, HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspection of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards.

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations so as to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.<\/p><p>On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016.  The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under 1 year of age and the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme as recommended by NIAC takes this into account.  <\/p><p>All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  <\/p><p>There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the following meningitis vaccines are provided to children born on or after 1 October 2016 as part of the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule:<\/p><p>- 2 months - 6-in-1, pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) and Men B;<\/p><p>- 4 months - 6-in-1 and Men B (Meningococcal B);<\/p><p>- 6 months - 6-in-1, PCV and Men C (Meningococcal C);<\/p><p>- 12 months - Men B;<\/p><p>- 13 months - Hib\/Men C and PCV.<\/p><p>Note that the 6-in-1 vaccine contains Hib (Haemophilus influenzae b).<\/p><p>Adolescents are also given a Men C booster vaccine in the first year of secondary school against meningitis as part of the School Immunisation Programme.<\/p><p>It is important to note that, although some of the recent notified cases are related to Meningitis B, none of the deaths have been attributed to this strain of the disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100051#WRF07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":400,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100052#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[4749\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100052#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for an outpatients appointment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":402,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April. <\/p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. <\/p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity. The HSE has advised that results of smear tests may take up to 22 weeks from the time of the test. Although many results are returned in less time, some may take longer.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the contracted laboratories, and reports they have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to address this issue.

The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time. While spurdog is showing some signs of recovery from the historical lows of the mid 2000s, the period is very short in comparison to the longer-term historical decline.<\/p>  <p>  The spawning biomass of this species is at an extremely low level, although conservation measures in recent years have had an impact in terms of stabilising the decline. The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing. The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that there should be no targeted fisheries in 2019 and 2020 and that any possible provision for landing of by-catch should only happen as part of a management plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fisheries. The Marine Institute fully supports the ICES advice and has very serious concerns about the state of the stock. <\/p>  <p>  A very limited quota is available (53t for Ireland) for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce such by-catches. Any such schemes are subject to EU Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of spurdog in other fisheries i.e. the targeting of spurdog would remain prohibited. Such a scheme for spurdog avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute and, following consultation with industry, a draft pilot scheme was submitted for review to the Commission&rsquo;s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). <\/p>  <p>  STECF raised a number of queries about the proposed scheme, in particular on whether or not it would result in a reduction in catches of spurdog relative to the catches that would occur in the absence of a scheme. Having considered the STECF comments and concerns, the Marine Institute reviewed the draft scheme and has now advised that Ireland should not proceed further with the spurdog avoidance scheme but rather work collaboratively with other Member States and the Commission to explore possible management measures going forward. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Discards","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[4771\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will address a matter regarding the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>As Deputy Healy-Rae will already be aware, this year is the first full year of the implementation of the landing obligation, or 'discards ban' under the Common Fisheries Policy. The objective of the landing obligation is to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding fish at sea. This will result in benefits both to the marine environment and to fishermen alike, securing fish stocks for the future. The application of the landing obligation for all Irish stocks in 2019, coupled with a move towards fishing at maximum sustainable yield levels (rebuilding  stocks to a sustainable optimum), are very positive developments for fishermen and for the broader goal of sustainability.<\/p>  <p>  In order to support the rollout of the landing obligation, in December 2017 I announced a quota balancing policy for pelagic stocks. Quota balancing means that where a vessel exceeds its catch limit for a particular stock during a fishery management period, a balancing adjustment is made from a future catch limit for that vessel. Quota balancing is a management, conservation and rational exploitation measure that will aid in matching catch limit to actual catch to support the landing obligation requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Mackerel is the main pelagic stock targeted by Irish fishermen. Preliminary data provided for 2018 Mackerel landings indicated that where vessels landed over their 2018 catch limits, most of these vessels landed less than 10% over their 2018 catch limit for Mackerel. A very small number of vessels landed far in excess of their 2018 catch limits for Mackerel. Thus, to allow for quota balancing, I agreed that initial 2019 quota allocations for mackerel be restricted to a lower level. A multiplying factor applies in Quota Balancing so that the greater the excess catch when compared to the catch limit, the larger the balancing adjustment that will be made. In a small number of cases, where vessels caught far in excess of their allocated catch limit in 2018, their 2019 catch limit was reduced accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have made provision for a maximum quota balancing adjustment, so that no more than 80% of the catch limit available to a vessel for a relevant pelagic stock should be applied in an individual fishery management period. This would mean that vessels would receive as a minimum 20% of the catch limit for that pelagic stock that would have been available to the vessel for that fishery management period had quota balancing not been applied. The licence holder will be granted an Authorisation and\/or Notification to fish the reduced quantity of that stock for the fishery management period and any outstanding quota balancing adjustment still remaining at the end of the fishery management period is carried over into a subsequent fishery management period until a full adjustment is made.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the quota balancing policy was introduced following discussions with the Quota Management Advisory Committee and a public consultation and received the support of the majority of fishing representative organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Licence holders were sent the provisional details of quota balancing for Mackerel last week and advised that no further action was required on their behalf, unless they did not agree with the data on their provisional quota balancing statement. If licence holders did not agree with the data, they were advised that enquiries were to be made by a set date. Declared Landings\/Trips enquiries are to be submitted to the SFPA while Catch Limit(s)\/Calculation of Balancing Adjustment enquiries are to be submitted to the Department.  In the event of a non-reply by this set date, all data (as submitted by the Master of the Vessel) will be deemed final for the purposes of Quota Balancing only.  Licence holders were further advised that a final quota balancing statement will issue after the final date for enquires has passed, and that and a balancing adjustment will be made, at the earliest possible opportunity, against future catch limit(s).<\/p>  <p>  Quota balancing operates independent of any action being considered or taken by the control authorities and the data being used is that logged by the master of the fishing vessel in the landing declaration submitted at the end of each trip for each vessel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Warmer Homes Scheme Applications","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":562,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[4714\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100054#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if an application for the insulation of a house under the SEAI warmer homes scheme by a person (details supplied) will be considered; if the application will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1303","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":563,"content":"<p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) operates the Warmer Homes Scheme on behalf of my Department.

This generally means that for each day that a person is employed, 1\/5th of the normal rate of jobseeker's benefit is deducted.  In order to continue to receive a jobseekers payment they must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7.  In the interest of fairness these rules apply to all jobseeker's benefit customers.<\/p>  <p>  Ordinarily, all those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment must engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process and can face penalty rates if they refuse to engage with Department offers of training or education.

Meeting this target means lifting more than 70,000 children out of poverty by that date.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the BOBF Framework, a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty has been adopted, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The latest data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) show a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate for children, which decreased from 10.9% to 8.8%, a reduction of 2.1 percentage points, the second highest reduction in the rate since the collection of SILC data began in 2004.  <\/p>  <p>  The full benefit of the growing economy and the increases introduced in more recent Budgets has yet to be seen.  Budgets 2018 and 2019 have included measures specifically aimed at supporting families on low incomes through increases in qualified child rates, increases in earnings disregards for One Parent Family and Jobseeker Transition payments, and an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  These increased supports along with increasing employment rates suggest that we can expect further decreases in the poverty rates once the 2018 figures become available. <\/p>  <p>  However, the challenge Ireland faces in trying to achieve the child poverty target needs some perspective: at the height of the economic boom in 2008, when the consistent poverty rate for children was its lowest, there were 68,000 children in consistent poverty.  So, in order to meet the target, Ireland will have to be more than twice as effective as our best ever performance to date.  <\/p>  <p>  While social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and Ireland is among the best performing EU States for reducing poverty through social transfers, tackling child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health, housing and childcare.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is in the final stages of drafting the new Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy which will assemble in one place the range of policy measures across government departments that are designed to address the different aspects of poverty and social exclusion.

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. <\/p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  My Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced later in Q1 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid 2019.<\/p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning Acts, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Therefore, it is not intended to place a moratorium on applications for planning permission for wind farm developments as referred to pending the finalisation of the revisions to the 2006 Guidelines. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100056#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100056#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[4704\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019013100056#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the maritime area and foreshore (amendment Bill) will be brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; the key elements of the legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>The Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill has three main aims:<\/p>  <p>  -  to align the foreshore consent system with the planning system;<\/p>  <p>  -  to provide for a single Environmental Impact Assessment for projects; and <\/p>  <p>  -  to provide a coherent mechanism to facilitate and manage development in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and on the continental shelf.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will provide that decisions on development consent for projects in the maritime area (comprising the foreshore, EEZ and continental shelf) should be made either by local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, depending on the location, size and scale of the development, and on whether EIA is required.
