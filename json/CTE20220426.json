My name is Arlene Forster and I am the CEO of the NCCA.  I am joined by two colleagues, Mr. Barry Slattery, deputy CEO, and Ms Evelyn O&rsquo;Connor, acting director.<\/p> <p>  Appointed by the Minister for Education, the council is a representative structure.  Its remit is to advise the Minister on curriculum for early childhood education, primary and post-primary schools, and the assessment procedures employed in schools and examinations on subjects that are part of the curriculum.  In carrying out this remit, the council oversaw a review of senior cycle between 2016 and 2020.  The review involved extensive work with schools and high levels of collaboration and engagement with stakeholders.  It culminated in the development of the Senior Cycle Review:<\/p> <p>Advisory Report which was submitted to the Minister for consideration and published following the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on 29 March 2022.<\/p> <p>  The advisory report records and responds to the range of stakeholders&rsquo; views about how senior cycle could evolve to meet the needs of all young people.  In addition, the report signals the common ground that emerged.  That common ground centres on a renewed vision for this stage of education and on clear purposes and guiding principles for a redeveloped senior cycle.  In this way, the report provides strong foundations for the redevelopment of this stage of education so that it continues to do the following: educate the whole person; helps every student to become more enriched, engaged and competent; serves collective and individual purposes; and helps students to access diverse futures.<\/p> <p>  The report identifies three key areas for further research and action.  These include: providing more flexible pathways through senior cycle; having a greater mix of subjects and modules, including technical, creative and vocational options; and broadening assessment and reporting arrangements.  The report summarises the themes that emerged in the review and outlines what these might mean in a redeveloped senior cycle.  The three key areas - pathways and flexibility, curriculum components, and assessment, reporting and transitions - link directly to the themes identified by this committee in its exploration of leaving certificate reform.<\/p> <p>  The report also describes conducive conditions which we need to pay attention to as we move to the next stage of work.  The report concludes with a commitment to continued extensive consultation and collaboration with schools and all education partners as the senior cycle is redeveloped and as a framework for senior cycle is co-constructed.  The council looks forward to a briefing with Department of Education officials in the coming weeks as it plans a programme of work grounded in the advisory report and the Minister&rsquo;s announcement.<\/p> <p>  Moving briefly to the Irish language, as part of ongoing work on senior cycle, the NCCA developed draft leaving certificate specifications for Irish L1 and L2.  Work is advanced on the analysis of the consultation data and findings will be presented in a report later this year.  In addition, a report on the early enactment review of junior cycle Irish will be published.  These reports, along with the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement, will provide a basis for the next steps in this important work.<\/p> <p>  Further information is provided in the NCCA&rsquo;s written submission and accompanying reports.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to attend before them to discuss the reform of the leaving certificate and the senior cycle.  My name is Andrea Feeney and I am the chief executive officer of the State Examinations Commission, SEC.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Elaine Sheridan, head of examinations and assessment, and Mr. Richard Dolan, director of operations.<\/p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities include the development, assessment, accreditation and certification of the second level school examinations and the board of commissioners are the custodians of this key national service.  The SEC is committed to working in partnership with all education stakeholders to develop and deliver a high-quality examinations and assessment system, centred on the needs of students.<\/p> <p>  Our appearance before the committee follows the recent announcement by the Minister and the publication by the NCCA of its report on the review of senior cycle.  We commend our NCCA colleagues for their extensive work and recognise the deep and meaningful contribution of stakeholders, many of whom have already appeared before this committee, in the review and consultation process.<\/p> <p>  The stated purpose of the leaving certificate is to measure the extent to which each student has fulfilled the objectives of the syllabus.<\/p><p>This examination is an important event in the lives of young people.  In conducting the examinations, the SEC prioritises fairness and equity, quality in all aspects and upholding examinations integrity and consistency of standards to the greatest degree possible.  <\/p><p> It is also noted that the leaving certificate results are used for a number of other purposes, including by employers and as a tool of progression to further education.  The latter, in particular, increases the high-stakes nature of the leaving certificate.<\/p><p> In advance of this appearance, the SEC made a submission under the four broad thematic headings identified by the committee.  I will now focus briefly on three of those headings.<\/p><p> We have set out in our submission the wide range of components that we provide that extend the assessment landscape far beyond the written examinations and allow students to demonstrate their knowledge, understanding and skills in areas that cannot always be assessed in a written examination.  Of the 41 subjects being examined at leaving certificate level in 2022, 27 have a component of assessment additional to the written examination worth at least 20%, and in some subjects, up to 60% of the marks.<\/p><p> We look forward to building on this experience in the reform of the senior cycle.  We will work with the NCCA, Department colleagues and through the implementation structures to give effect to the changes announced, including reducing the reliance on the final written examination.  We also will engage in a programme of research and development on a number of aspects, including the impact of weighting and timing of these additional components in order that they are worth at least 40% in all subjects.  We also will implement interim measures to spread the load of assessment pending full subject redevelopment.  High-stakes examinations are, by their nature, inherently stressful events.  Therefore, care will be required in spreading the load of assessment to mitigate the potential for stress throughout the school year.  We also have been asked to jointly research with the NCCA externally moderated school-based assessment and how it will operate in an Irish context, noting that such assessment models are widely used in other jurisdictions.<\/p><p> On digital learning, the SEC has invested in a number of key IT tools to streamline communications, enhance transparency and improve the delivery of examinations.  Coursework components in some leaving certificate subjects are completed digitally by students, and technology also has a very significant role for students with special educational needs, allowing them to access the examinations.  However, the deployment of technology in assessment, rather than supporting assessment, is at an early stage at second level education in Ireland.  It is recognised by the OECD that the development of digitally-based examinations is resource intensive and expensive, and often beyond the reach of national examinations boards.  We welcome the inclusion in the announcement of exploration of the potential uses of IT in examinations and assessment, as well as the recognition that this must be tied into the digital strategy for schools.<\/p><p> Accessibility in the examinations starts at design stage and we design our test instruments to be as accessible to the widest range of students as possible. Through the reasonable accommodations at certificate examinations, RACE, scheme, we provide students with special needs with the support arrangements they need to access the examinations.  Much work has been done by the board of the SEC to reform the scheme in recent years.  The scheme will be subject to further review in the context of senior cycle reform and a priority will be increasing the use of assistive technology to enhance access and to further support independent learning.  <\/p><p> The recent announcement by the Minister for Education sets the trajectory for an ambitious programme of senior cycle reform.  The review process demonstrated consensus on the need for change.  It also recognised the high level of public support and trust attached to the existing leaving certificate qualification and modes of assessment.  In undertaking further work, there will be particular focus by the SEC in seeking to underpin validity and reliability in the assessment in order that the integrity of the leaving certificate qualification and public trust and confidence in that qualification are maintained.<\/p><p> The examinations system relies upon the support of teachers, school leaders and other stakeholders for its success.  We welcome and value the contribution of the student and parent voice in what we do and how we do it and we wish to strengthen and deepen our relationships in our ongoing work and as we embark on the process of reform.<\/p><p> We look forward to working with colleagues in the NCCA, with the Minister and officials in her Department and with all of the stakeholders in education in the time ahead, contributing to the necessary reform of the educational landscape at senior cycle to the benefit of students and wider society<\/p><p> My colleagues and I would be very happy to respond to any questions that the committee may have.  I apologise for going over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is okay.

This is probably the first time since some of the Covid restrictions were lifted that these two organisations are before the committee.  I wish to acknowledge that even though issues around the examinations and so on were much debated, both organisations worked under extreme pressure during the Covid pandemic.  I acknowledge the work that went in at that stage.<\/p><p> I will briefly touch on the issue of the Irish language and the Teanga 1, T1, and Teanga 2, T2, specifications.  I do not require a response because I know that response will be that there is to be a consultation, we are going to work through that and that is all okay.  I want to put the following point on record, as I did in my written submission.  There is a logic to two separate approaches but students need to be incentivised in the form of additional marks or offering this as an additional subject.  I find it difficult to understand why fluent Irish speakers or Gaeltacht students would take on a more challenging course without gaining some benefit.<\/p><p> More generally in terms of the leaving certificate, Ms Feeney talked about a consensus nearly emerging.  I would not say that there is a complete consensus but there was a broad consensus and members of this committee found that as well in our discussions on the leaving certificate.  A lot of the issues and concerns that existed related to whether the leaving certificate measures the skills that are needed in a modern society and whether the amount of stress that is put on the final terminal exam is disproportionate.  The move towards greater continuous assessment is something that I and a lot of the committee members would welcome.<\/p><p> What was outlined by the Minister for Education was necessarily broad, vague and to a large extent unclear.  I do not say that as a criticism because one must start these processes with a high-level vision but a lot of questions must be worked out and I wish to put two to both organisations.  The term \"continuous assessment\" can mean any number of things.  During the past week the teachers' unions have vocally expressed their concerns about marking the work of their own students.  Obviously there are arguments for and against but continuous assessment does not necessarily mean teachers must mark their own students' work.  Can the representatives of both organisations comment on the extent to which non-teacher-assessed continuous assessment is possible?  Are additional components required?  The example that has been given is the subject of chemistry.  One could have a practical exam and there are practical exams as distinct from projects in, for example, construction studies.  Perhaps there could be short papers at an earlier stage.  To what extent is this possible?  To what extent are there areas that cannot be delivered externally and independently, and require the input of the teacher who knows his or her students?  These issues comprise a lot of what we must work out.<\/p><p> There is another issue that is not immediately clear but perhaps it is and just was not clear to me.  We are talking about taking an English paper and an Irish paper in fifth year.  To me, the Minister does not seem to have precluded additional marks in other subjects being required in fifth year.  There are no details on whether that will be possible and I ask the representatives of the NCCA for their view.<\/p><p> My next query is for both organisations.  If we are going down the route of more additional components as part of the 40%, whether that is in terms of the example I have given of chemistry or of other subjects, schools will require a significant investment in equipment.  I have already mentioned construction studies and the equipment that schools have for that is not fit for purpose.  I mean that the equipment does not support schools in ensuring that students can get the benefit of studying these subjects.<\/p><p> My final question is for the SEC.  There is a proposal that network schools will lead the way in the roll-out of this scheme.  I imagine the challenges are far from insurmountable but it will be somewhat challenging in terms of the allocation of third level places.  Where there are two different streams of examination in those given years, has the SEC thoughts on how that can be surmounted? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#D00300","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  I will begin to pick up on them and then my colleagues, Mr. Slattery and Ms O'Connor, may like to come in as well.<\/p> <p>  To take the comments as a whole, the Deputy has touched on a lot of both the strengths and challenges that were identified through the senior cycle review in terms of assessment, in particular.  Obviously, assessment is one of the three main areas that were identified in the review.<\/p><p>There is an acknowledgement in the advisory report - the Minister picked up on this - of the need and importance of additional research and of working closely with schools and the education partners in terms of examining the details of what updated assessment arrangements might look like.<\/p><p> Regarding teacher assessment and whether other forms of assessment could fulfil that role, one of the findings of the senior cycle review &ndash; it is clearly set out in the advisory report &ndash; was the importance of looking at broadening the range of assessment approaches and methods.  One of the key reasons for doing this is to assess a much broader range of the knowledge, skills, values and dispositions that we deem important for our young people and, in doing so, reduce the emphasis on the written examination.  Internationally, different systems put different assessment arrangements in place, but there are common characteristics across many jurisdictions.  One of those is a move towards teacher-based assessment.  One of the rationales used in many jurisdictions that introduced teacher assessment was the emphasis on greater validity, or in other words, putting assessment arrangements in place that can better capture the range of learning and experiences that we deem important for our young people and, in doing so, give young people opportunities to demonstrate their learning in different ways.<\/p><p> A point that is often made by authorities in the assessment field &ndash; the committee has met some of them during its deliberations in recent months &ndash; is that it is important that, when broadening assessment arrangements, the additional assessment components that are introduced do not necessarily emphasise the paper and pencil format.  They need to look to other methodologies.  The Deputy asked about practicals for a young person to demonstrate particular skills or techniques in a discipline.  That is one of the reasons that teacher assessment is sometimes used in other jurisdictions, in that it opens up different methods and forms of assessment.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, though, the details of all of this need to be worked out.  We need to draw on research and work with schools to see what is manageable and feasible and what supports need to be put in place to enable this approach in our school system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked what would be possible in terms of a move to more components in fifth year.

We have recently been using network schools for new subjects like physical education and computer science and will do the same with climate action and drama, film and theatre studies.

When officials from the Department of Education appeared before us a number of months ago, I asked them what the main difference was between the time I did the leaving certificate in 1994 and the leaving certificate now.  The suggestion from the Department was that it was not different in any radical way.  At its inception, the leaving certificate was a qualification with which one went into the world.  Now, it is a qualification with which one goes on to the next stage of education.  There is a different dynamic that goes with it now.<\/p><p>Indeed, when we were trying to reform the junior certificate we had that same kind of view that young people do not go into the world with their junior certificates as they might have done with their intermediate certificates back in the day.  This is the question I really have for the witnesses.  We are trying to reform something that everybody or most people accept needs to be radically reformed.  There is a level trust with the leaving certificate, however, and we must be careful about how we tinker with that.  People feel that it is transparent; I would not use the word \"fair\".  It is incredibly brutal.<\/p><p> We have come to the stage now where people who do it successfully become good at doing leaving certificates.  There is an industry built around it.  We must be honest about that.  There are grind schools and people who are willing to sell notes.  There is a whole industry built around getting one's child or a young person through this system.  Parents are able to buy or use those extra resources.  There is, therefore, fundamentally an inequality at the heart of the leaving certificate.<\/p><p> Not every school is the same and not every school can offer the same options.  Not every school can offer higher level Irish, English and mathematics and basic core subjects such as those.  How do we come to a scenario, therefore, where if we are going to assess people, we are assessing them fairly?  How do we ensure that every student has the opportunity to study whatever subject he or she feels best fits his or her skill set and can study it at whatever level he or she feels they can?  How unfair is it to have a second-level school that does not offer honours or higher level Irish thereby restricting that young person from ever being a primary school teacher, for example?  Those schools exist.  I remember once being a secondary school substitute teacher.  I came across a young woman who was teaching herself higher level mathematics in a room by herself because there was no higher level maths teacher in the school.  The level of determination that young woman went through to do and study that is unthinkable in a more middle-class advantaged scenario.<\/p><p> This is my general point.  What kind of discussion is going on as to how to level out that inequality to ensure that every student, no matter what school he or she goes to, can through remote learning or any other way avail of every single possibility or level of subjects he or she can?  Yes, we may have a transparent leaving certificate but it does not have the brutality and inequality attached to it.<\/p><p> I will touch on when Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and I attended the teacher conferences.  There was a sense of resistance to this idea of assessing one's own students from the conferences we attended.  If we are going to reform then we must reform.  I cannot pretend that the teacher unions have ever been friends of reform when it comes to examination structures in Ireland.  I bear the wounds of the junior certificate reform process in that regard.  We have to bring people with us whatever our opinions.  They are my two main points.  How do we make it fairer than just being transparent?  How do we bring people with us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#F00500","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I cannot address the broader system issue in relation to the level of advantage that various schools have but I can address it from the examinations perspective and what the SEC does to recognise that inequity is there.  When we are assessing examinations we are looking at issues of fairness, particularly when it comes to the second and third components of assessment.  Within subjects that have a coursework element, therefore, be it a portfolio, an oral or aural examination or a project or artefact that a student has to make, there are particular conditions attached to how he or she undertakes that work.  It must be in school and under the supervision of the teacher.  We very much recognise that if those conditions are not there, it presents opportunities for students who are more advantaged outside of the school to use and have more resources at their disposal than others who come from less privileged backgrounds.<\/p> <p>  I remember the early days of Covid-19 when we were looking at the arrangements we could put in place for students outside school to be able to complete their work in the various subjects.  This was before the decision was taken to cancel the examinations that year.  That was a real cause of concern for the State Examinations Commission.  If we did not have those conditions of authentication and completion, then we were allowing the opportunity of the level of resource that students had to be brought to bear in the examination context.<\/p><p>I do not claim it is a perfect system; if it was a perfect system, we might not be here having the conversation about reform but the SEC does recognise there is a need to try to level the playing pitch.  We do that within the examinations context by having very strong authentication procedures, that is, procedures for the integrity of the process.  It does not address the broader question but within the senior cycle reform process, those issues have been brought to bear.  A broader piece of work about which colleagues in the Department are exercised is how to address disadvantage within schools but that is not within my remit in discussing this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I will build on Ms Feeney's comments from a curriculum perspective.  The Deputy touched on something that was a very prominent theme throughout the review of the senior cycle, which focused on how can a redeveloped senior cycle support all students more equitably?  That is very much echoed in the three main areas I drew attention to in our opening statement.  Of those three areas, I draw particular attention to the area of pathways and flexibility.  That was identified as being one of the key levers in ensuring that a redeveloped senior cycle would much better meet the needs of all young people who enter into the senior cycle stage of their education and by that opening up of different pathways and routes through senior cycle.  For example, one action we identified coming out of the review was the importance of having much greater choice for young people in the type of programme they would experience as part of the senior cycle.  Part of that would include auditing current provision across our programmes with an eye to finding ways to provide greater opportunity for young people in technical and professional learning and learning in the creative area.  That is with a view to leaving young people in a much better position to transition into whatever path they choose to follow, whether that is straight into apprenticeships, further or higher education or directly into the world of work.<\/p> <p>  Another area that the advisory report highlights holds great potential for the Deputy's question about access for young people to the range of subjects that even currently makes up the senior cycle.  It is about exploring the power of technology and the possibility perhaps of a combination of online learning but also of blended learning.  We have some experience in our system that we can draw on.  For instance, island schools have some provision for people to access some of the science subjects by using technology.  Consequently, we have small amounts of experience that we can draw on.  In the advisory report, we flag up the potential of technology to really contribute to access and in particular to ensure that students can be supported more equitably.  <\/p> <p>  Working directly with schools is important.  In the advisory report, we really emphasised our clear commitment to continuing to working very closely with schools in all of the work in the redevelopment of the senior cycle.  When we talk about more flexibility and choice and different pathways through the senior cycle, it will be really important that we work closely with schools to look in real terms at what works, what are the challenges and how we work around them.  We have committed to do that.  One of the ambitions has the area of equity particularly in mind.  There is lots of potential there but we have a lot of work still to do to work out the detail.

I welcome that there is a proposal that in respect of languages we are going to have a greater focus on the oral examination.  I think there is to be further emphasis on it.  Both bodies have done a good job amid the difficulties Covid has caused for us all but I am conscious that during the Irish oral examinations over Easter we had 50,000 students and the vast majority of them were able to do their orals.  However, there was a segment of 500 who were not.  I am aware both bodies fully appreciate that is a very stressful event for those students but if it was the case that, for example, a written exam was to be postponed for a month, there would be national outrage about it.<\/p><p>This is not a criticism of the SEC by the way.  What can we do in the future to ensure that if there is some difficulty in conducting oral examinations they can be conducted fairly rapidly after that difficulty?

That was done because of Covid and as a response to the level of disruption and interruption students had already faced in their learning this year.  What happens when the oral examinations are on in a normal year is that the students' teachers are away.  If their teachers are engaging in the orals in other schools, they are away from their sixth year classes.  This can be challenging and difficult for the teachers and students involved.  The decision was taken this year to move the oral examinations to the Easter holidays in order to mitigate any potential for further disruption to learning.  We had to make sure that we had enough examiners to move it to the Easter holidays and we had to provide for sufficient reserves because of expected attrition due to Covid.  Covid has had an impact on all aspects of society and it impacted on the delivery of these examinations so we ended up with a final total of 600 students in 14 schools who were not able to take their oral examinations at Easter.  We will facilitate those students as soon as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  Part of the announcement was that students and teachers would get a break over Easter.  In moving the orals to the first week of the Easter holidays, there was a sense that in the second week they would still have their break so we allowed that break to happen.  We had also notified schools in advance that there would be a period for late orals.  Those late orals are there in a normal year to facilitate students who become ill at examination time.  We set aside that period, commencing on 4 May, for the late orals this year in order to provide for students who became ill and also in the event that we would have to reschedule because of attrition due to Covid.  Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to ensure that we had enough examiners to undertake the tests in the initial window, we had attrition due to Covid.  We made every effort to organise the tests for those students who were affected by it and we are arranging them at the earliest possible opportunity, which is that period commencing next week.  There had been a criticism to the effect that we should have had them last week.  The reason I have mentioned in this regard is that the break needed to be there for students.  It has also been suggested that we should have had them this week.  In having the capacity we need, we are also being conscious of not impacting further on teaching and learning times.  As a result, we are using retired examiners and teachers who are not in schools in order to ensure that capacity.  They are not available to us all of the time so by having the date set aside commencing on 4 May, we have capacity in the system to do it.  We provided that date in order to bring a level of certainty.  I appreciate that it is not ideal for the students concerned, but that certainty was there.<\/p> <p>  The bigger question the Deputy asked was on how we protect ourselves from these interruptions and issues into the future.  Going back to the senior cycle reform process and the interruption of Covid over the past two years, we have seen that if we had a type of assessment system or senior cycle programme where there is more dispersed assessment, it might give us greater capacity to cope with emergency situations as and when they arise.  That is a long answer to the Deputy's short question, but it is important to give the detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I know, and I appreciate the answer.  The objective in the future should be to recognise that if an examination date is given, then students are prepared for that.

It would, however, be stressful if an examination was due to happen on a particular day and people were then told one or two days before that it is not going to go ahead.  I hear Ms Feeney's answer.  I understand why there would has to be a back-up plan for circumstances where students become ill or if there are bereavements and where they have to take the examinations later.

I accept the answer that was given but I do not accept the explanation because the cancellation should have been flagged at least a week in advance and not the day before.  It was disappointing for any student affected.  The past two years have been upsetting for students.  Students have come before this committee to talk about the effects the pandemic has had on them.

Most of our guests did their leaving certificates in the 1990s or earlier.  There is considerable stress for students who are involved in the points system now.  I have three kids and I am dreading the two years approaching the leaving certificate because of the points race.  There is a notion that one is not sexy anymore if one is not going to third level institutions.  Colleges are not good enough anymore; one must attend university, with the points race that involves.  Apprenticeships and everything else have been forgotten about.  I must commend the Minister, Deputy Harris, on his work to encourage students to undertake apprenticeships and the associated CAO system.  <\/p> <p>  I know some of our guests have mentioned a moratorium of the sort that applies for elections whereby the media are not allowed to cover an election for the preceding 24 hours.  Students are receiving one message from their teachers and are often receiving another message from their parents.  The messages from the media come in on top of that.  Not alone are the media driving the students mad, they are also driving the parents mad.  Those parents in turn go on to drive the students mad.  I am glad our guests have said they would like something done about it.  What can be done?  It is not their job to make that decision but I presume they have discussed the issue.  I have no doubt the issue came up as part of the review.  I am interested in hearing the views of the representatives of both organisations on this matter and what they would like politicians to do.  Is there something the politicians can do?  Have our guests spoken to our national broadcaster about the matter?  RT&Eacute; is getting taxpayers' money and is acting irresponsibly in some of its coverage.  I am interested in our guests' views and whether they have had any conversation with the media on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#N00100","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Reflecting on the comments and observations of the Chairman, many of the issues go back to how embedded the leaving certificate is in our culture and Irish society, as we touched on earlier.  One of the other things that struck me as the Chairman was sharing his comments and questions was the value we place on the different programmes that currently make up senior cycle provision.<\/p><p>This theme emerged in the review itself.  Review participants spoke about the real challenge in terms of achieving parity of esteem regarding the programmes we already have.  In particular, they referenced the leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programme.  As we know, 95% of young people take the leaving certificate established.  The Chairman has already touched on the extent to which we see that in terms of a pathway or an entry into higher education and university.  I believe some of it is about the values that we hold as a society.  They are hard to challenge but we need to find a way to challenge them.  From the NCCA's perspective, the senior cycle review advisory report sets out and really highlights the importance of looking at more pathways for young people and as part of that, of working as best we can to value those different pathways in order that young people see them as viable options, are given the space to think hard about what is the pathway and route they want to follow and what are their own career ambitions and aspirations.  There is an absolute commitment in our review report for the redevelopment of the senior cycle to really open up those discussions and get into detailed work with schools about trying to build more flexibility and pathways into senior cycle provision itself.<\/p><p> I want to pick up on something else that is relevant to the points the Chairman has made and on which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan touched a little while ago.  I refer to the relationship between the leaving certificate, in particular leaving certificate results, and the CAO system.  Ms Feeney has spoken about this and on the question about decoupling and the challenges that can raise as well.  Interestingly, in the review of the senior cycle, because as one would expect, this was part of the discussions, there was a resignation, albeit a reluctant one by some participants in the review, that such decoupling would raise its own set of difficulties and challenges.  There was also an acceptance that as we redevelop the senior cycle, that relationship will need to continue to exist to some extent.  However, as the senior cycle review advisory report emphasises the importance of a review of the CAO system and of the CAO system taking account of a redeveloped senior cycle, therein might lie some potential for trying to engender and encourage a value of the different pathways that a young person could follow as part of a redeveloped senior cycle.<\/p><p> On the specific question on whether we have had direct engagement with the national broadcaster and media on the coverage, in particular in the June period, we have not had direct engagement to date.  Certainly the piece that he referenced about the intense focus on the coverage in the media in the June examination period, did feature as part of our discussions but to date, we have not had follow-up directly with the broadcaster on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Would the NCCA welcome dialogue with media outlets and the national broadcaster on the issues that were raised in the review?

Our colleagues in the curriculum agency in Belgium have found themselves subject to a legal challenge in their constitutional courts.  The basis of it is that there is over-prescription of learning outcomes and it negates the Belgian educators&rsquo; rights to curriculum freedom.  At the same meeting, colleagues from the Netherlands expressed the dilemma that they were in, which is a reverse issue - albeit not necessarily a legal one - where they are coming under increasing pressure to address the learning outcomes that are regarded as too broad.  There are different perspectives.  It is fair to say that different people understand curriculum in different ways.  Some see it as an official text that will be faithfully implemented and received in schools and prefer a very highly prescriptive curriculum, whereas others see it is as something that is more dynamic and prefer a more, let us say, permissive curriculum that has less emphasis on specifying every single piece of content and more attention on the development of skills, for example.  I will not come down on the side of either perspective but the irony is that both perspectives are premised on the same assumption, namely, the national curriculum, be it a permissive or prescriptive curriculum, will be implemented in schools exactly as intended.  However, the reality is that teachers are not passive conduits who deliver somebody else&rsquo;s curriculum.  They will be translating and mediating the curriculum within their own context to meet the needs and interests of their students.  Both perspectives underplay the complexities of this reality of the social practice of curriculum and the curriculum-making that happens in schools.<\/p> <p>  I will get to the answer now with two points.<\/p><p>The strength of the network-based school approach to the redevelopment of the senior cycle is that it will give us the opportunity to work with teachers in a way that will allow us to look at the exact nature and form of the curriculum, the resources, the supports, the professional development and the professional time that is required for teachers to work with the curriculum in the best possible way to deliver the best possible outcomes for their students.  Absolutely, we intend to conduct additional research and consult with teachers on those issues even before we engage with schools.  I wish it was as simple as conducting research that says this is exactly the way it should be and that it would solve all problems.  We have seen this issue in other jurisdictions.  That issue came up only as recently as yesterday, but I have been hearing about the same issues in other jurisdictions for more than ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Slattery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Some stakeholders have suggested that continuous assessment may also be stressful.

I personally am very supportive of it but other people who have appeared before the committee may not be as in favour of continuous assessment.  They have said it will still be a very stressful time for students and that the term \"continuous assessment\" has negative connotations.  Do the NCCA and the SEC plan to address this issue?  Would modularisation, whereby several assignments are completed in the school for each subject with a wide range of topics, be a better option?

Ms O'Connor spoke earlier about the consensus that we arrived at around the purpose of a redeveloped senior cycle.  Working on from that, as we get into the individual subjects, modules or units of learning, the question is what is the contribution of each of those to a young person's overall education.  Once we are clear about the teaching and learning, the onus is on us to design assessment arrangements that are the best fit in terms of giving young people the opportunities to demonstrate that learning as best they can.  Part of it is giving them opportunities to demonstrate learning in a number of different ways.<\/p> <p>  As for the Chairman's questions on continuous assessment, as Mr. Slattery has mentioned, this is where the work with schools becomes really important because that work enables us to ask many of the practical questions, including some of the questions the Chair has just put to us, around what the benefits might be and, equally, what the real challenges and difficulties might be with the different forms, modes and timing of assessments.  Working closely with schools is a very important part of this.  It is not unique to the assessment piece.  It goes right across the board in terms of what we hope to do through the redevelopment of the senior cycle.<\/p> <p>  The other piece I would add is the research.  Mr. Slattery mentioned the extent to which we keep our eyes and ears open to international practice and experience.  That research piece will become very important for us.  In the senior cycle review advisory report, we identified a number of pieces of research, some in the assessment space, that will become critical for us as we move into the next stage of the work, which involves getting into more of the detail and nuances of areas such as assessment.<\/p> <p>  We need to put all those pieces in place to be able to take some of those practical questions and work them out in partnership with schools and education partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I will hand over to my colleague in a moment but what we currently have in the system should be borne in mind, in that there are subjects with additional components of assessment.  There is no doubt but that students going into those final exams in those subjects will say that they have banked some marks, so it takes some of the pressure off.  What we need to be careful about, if introducing components of assessments in all subjects, is how we time and schedule them so there is not a constant feeling of stress on students throughout the senior cycle programme.<\/p><p>I ask my colleague Ms Sheridan to elaborate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>It is building on what Ms Forster has said.  Again, going back to the recent announcement and the review, it is about doing research.  It is learning from others and seeing what has worked in other jurisdictions and what has not.  For example, the UK is moving back to linear exams and less modularisation.  However, we must remember the assessment load.  There are already pinch points.  Of the 41 leaving certificate subjects, 27 currently have an additional component on top of the written exam, so depending on which subjects you choose for your leaving certificate you may already have extra coursework there.  If you are choosing seven subjects and all of them have an additional component there is a certain amount of load and there are pinch points.  Broadening it and the types and modes of assessment is therefore very important but that is back to the research.  It is back first of all to seeing what happens elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  Again, agreeing with Ms Forster and NCCA colleagues it is hugely important to look at how this manifests itself in the school environment.  Having been a teacher myself, you look at your own particular subject but you need to be careful as there are 41 subjects and students are taking seven or eight of them.  Much of this is about balancing.  There is no point thinking bringing in these additional components will lighten the load in June if they cause a complete congestion point in October or November of fifth or sixth year.  We must look to see what is done elsewhere and work very closely with the people who are on the ground delivering this to learn what is working for them in the school environment.  That will ensure whatever changes come about are to the benefit of the students at the end of the day and not another form of stress.  That is the key thing.

Students were not in favour of one alternative but were certainly against the concentration they felt they were experiencing at the moment.<\/p> <p>  In addition to learning from other jurisdictions there is also much to learn from the leaving certificate applied programme that currently exists.  It is a credit-based programme where the credits are allocated on the basis of different modules, so it is semesterised as it is broken into four sessions.  Ms Forster mentioned the work with schools.  That has flagged numerous times that one of the main directions for development in a redeveloped senior cycle is diversifying pathways.  We have been asked to look at how we can break down any ring-fencing.  There is also a very loud consensus from the reviews that we need to address the ring-fencing, which relates to many of the other issues we discussed earlier because it has a huge impact on parity of esteem and that has an impact on the uptake of the leaving certificate applied programme itself.

We have touched already on a number of the particular strategies within those that hold potential for reducing stress and pressure on young people such as the particular assessment arrangements that are in place, the particular programmes we currently have and removing ultimately the ring-fencing around those programmes but also making better provision for young people in areas such as technical learning, professional learning or creative learning.<\/p><p> I wish to pick up on an important aspect, namely, that of provision for young people with special educational needs.

They were positively received by students, their families and teachers who work with those young people.  As part of the review, one of the points that has been highlighted time and again is that currently there is no follow-through for those young people.  This is an important piece of work that is needed in order to ensure continuity and a pathway that is appropriate for young people.  As part of the review, attention was drawn to the importance of that work beginning as quickly as possible and that there would be a strong emphasis on it being age, peer and learning-needs appropriate.  That is a significant item of work that needs to be progressed quickly as part of the redevelopment of senior cycle so much so that in the advisory report we noted we were beginning a few particular pieces of work that were important to get off the ground quite quickly.

We talked about special educational needs in the context of level 1 and level 2 learning programmes, but in the context of the examinations we provide the reasonable accommodations at certificate examinations scheme, RACE.  We provide that in respect of students who have special educational needs that impact on their ability to communicate what they know and can do to an examiner.  Access arrangements are put in place for these students to allow them to sit the examinations.  The number of students we accommodate under the scheme each year is significant.  Some 17%, or more than 20,000, students taking examinations will access some form of reasonable accommodation.  The range of accommodations we provide are as complex and as extensive as the range of student needs we are trying to accommodate.  It is significant in terms of the support arrangements provided in order that students can access the examinations if they have some form of special need, whether it be physical or a form of a learning difficulty.<\/p> <p>  We spoke briefly about the pathways with respect to the leaving certificate applied.  One of the challenges within the system is that the leaving certificate applied is not valued.  It is not appreciated.  The leaving certificate applied is a wonderful programme.  We spoke about having a very high rate of retention.  Much of that is down to the leaving certificate applied.  Students who might have left school after the junior cycle in the past will go on and complete their leaving certificate applied and their qualification is as valued as the leaving certificate.  Unfortunately, the leaving certificate applied is not valued in the context of progression and students have more limited opportunities.  They can use it for further education but cannot use it to go to higher education directly.  They can pursue post-leaving courses but they cannot go directly to higher education.  There is a challenge in having that valued.  The debate and discourse on the senior cycle has been extremely helpful in shining a light on the leaving certificate applied programme and what it is doing for a cohort of young people who would have possibly left school without this final qualification were it not for that programme.  We would love there to be more recognition for that programme, the wonderful work leaving certificate applied co-ordinators in schools do and the wonderful engagement by students in that programme, which they bring throughout their two years in the senior cycle programme. Those are the two issues I wanted to raise in addressing Senator Flynn&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Feeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Before I hand over to Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, I must say that I concur with Ms Feeney.

Students often go through a phase in their life and they could be in their early 20s before they have a light bulb moment and realise they have great potential to offer.  Some of them may or may not have completed the leaving certificate applied.

Perhaps we need to lay down a blueprint for how to learn in a way that will bring people through life rather than just assessing the things they learn during their time in school.  What are our guests' thoughts on having more of a mentorship role and a more respectful relationship whereby teachers would be trusted to know what the young people sitting in front of them need and require through working collaboratively?

I am struck by the pedagogy aspect and the actual experience the young person has in partnership with his or her teacher but also with his or her peers in the room.  I am thinking back to the discussions that took place during the four years of the review.  One point that was made by participants in the review was that in the case of transition year, for example, or the leaving certificate applied programme, which we were talking a moment ago, as well as the experience of young people in the link modules, which make up the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, really creative and innovative work is happening in our schools and it is important we acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  From the perspective of pedagogy and the opening-up of democratic practice, part of it lies in the relationship between teaching, learning and assessment.  The three have to go hand in hand.  Some of it will probably involve looking again at what the assessment arrangements could be to demonstrate the learning we deem to be really important for young people.  As part of that, we will open up conversations about what types of experiences young people need to have access to the types of learning we deem important, and what assessment arrangements are best placed to enable young people to demonstrate that.<\/p> <p>  It is quite complex when we get into the detail of it, but I agree that the work with schools will open opportunities for us as we begin to examine that detail.  As Ms O'Connor said, for our part we always link this work back to the clear purpose that emerged for the redevelopment of the senior cycle and those eight guiding principles.  We arrived at those principles through consensus during the discussions as part of the review, and they have become very important reference points for us in our work with schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The final issue I raise relates to apprenticeships.

A great deal of what she outlined happens in transition year in many schools, given the level of autonomy transition year affords schools.  One issue that is probably not recognised sufficiently relates to the incredible creativity of schools and teachers to respond to the needs and interests of students.  Because of the autonomy, it is in some ways camouflaged within the system and we are not aware of it.  One step we have taken - I think it is to be published today or tomorrow - is the issuing of a call for expressions of interest from schools to get involved in a school-based review of the programme that will help us in the process of redeveloping the programme statement for transition year.<\/p><p>That is one of the actions that was announced by the Minister last month.  It is one specific action we are taking that will hopefully uncover some of that practice.<\/p><p> That brings us to the point the Senator raised about transition year and apprenticeships.  We concluded the review - prior to publication - it coincided with the launch of the future further education and training, FET, strategy by SOLAS.  Unsurprisingly, there were huge synergies between its ambitious agenda and the actions arising from the senior cycle review.  That can broadly be encompassed in the idea of looking at pathways from school to FET.  This includes: looking at the learning pathways in a redeveloped senior cycle; looking links between new apprenticeship opportunities and transition year programmes; and looking at the links between FET schools and others.  We established a standing committee, similar to the committee we would have with our colleagues in the SEC, with SOLAS.  We have already established a working group which has members from our executive and members from SOLAS and we have brought in the education and training boards, ETBs.  In that working group we are identifying where there are FET providers.  This is camouflaged throughout the system and it is happening in local pockets.  We have been conducting an audit of where FET providers have established strong relationships with schools to look at what modules they provide.  Already many of these modules and connections appear to be happening in transition year.  We are looking at the existing modules on offer, how they were created and what led to their development, and we are also looking at how we can offer them more broadly across transition year.  There is a long way to go but we have started that work with SOLAS and as I said, today or tomorrow a call will go out to schools to do that audit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#V00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Slattery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for attending.  The NCCA truly is a representative body for teachers, unions and parents and it has nominees on its board as well.  The SEC is a stand-alone body that reports directly to the Minister.  I see an advisory group here that is working with subject experts.  From what I understand, a nominee from the SEC also sits on the NCCA.  That is important.  I admire the work that has been completed in a difficult time, particularly by the SEC.  The SEC has done great work in the last two years, particularly for its assessors in managing and working with teaching groups to manage the continuous assessment and accredited grade system and so on that we have put in place in recent years.  I was incredibly impressed with the 40 subjects that are now managed by the SEC and assessors.  That is incredible.  Four extra languages were added for 2022, including Mandarin Chinese and Lithuanian, which is incredible to see.  I pay tribute to the broad range of subjects to accommodate new communities coming to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the assessment along the lines of that relating to the digital side and technology.  I understand that marks are added online and that is what is reviewed.  That will be made available to students and there will be a portal that is transparently available to students.  Would we not be moving to a system where students will be inputting their information online?  When do we see that happening?  What are the cybersecurity elements around that and is there a portion of budgets within the Department of Education that needs to be allocated for it?  My other questions are on the timelines for assessment.  Some of the concerns and challenges we had with this new system in the last two years were the timing of the assessments and the marking of results that came out.  In other words, they had an impact for third level, particularly for students who were going to the UK.  How will we manage that this year?  With the new model of continuous assessment, how will we manage to make sure that marking happens in a timely way for third level students who wish to take up courses in Europe, the UK or elsewhere?<\/p> <p>  I mention mindfulness in an exam setting.  National University of Ireland Galway has become the first university with mindfulness.  We talk an awful lot about mindfulness and well-being, but where are the actions?  How can we see it in an exam setting where students enter in panic mode at times?<\/p><p>I remember what I was like and I would be cramming until God knows what hour coming into an exam.  How can we get them to switch off, detox or whatever is and suddenly calm down and engage with the exam?  What sort of methods could we look at?<\/p><p> I thank the NCCA so much.  The reports it has done in recent years and the way it has engaged at different levels and at different stages with schools and parents have been incredible and a huge mountain of work has been done there.  It has led to continuous assessment, which is so important when it comes to DEIS and special needs students.  There are extra courses, including drama and film, as well as climate action and looking at our current global challenges.  I understand the concerns around the assessment and capacity of students but I refer to the expansion of transition year, where we are looking at apprenticeship taster courses.  How many of those would the NCCA recommend?  The witnesses have mentioned that the network schools pilot has been rolled out and will be launched and that network schools can apply for this.  Will there be a regional mix with the schools that are being selected ?  Is there a maximum number of schools where it will take place?  On international practice and comparison with other countries, were there one or two elements that the witnesses saw in other countries that they think we should consider for the future?

Colleagues in the National Education Psychological Service, NEPS, are doing a huge amount of work with schools on mindfulness and well-being.  The Senator asked what happens in the examination setting.  Our superintendents are teachers so they are used to dealing with young people and they are used to not just dealing with the mechanics of delivering the examinations but to also engaging with young people in that setting.  If a student is having a difficulty on the day, we have experienced people on hand in the examination centre and available to them in school.<\/p> <p>  On the technology issue the Senator raised, we are using a huge amount of technology and it has really stood to us over the past two years when we were able to deliver calculated and accredited grades.  We were able to do so because we had built up capacity in online marking.  The use of the candidate self-service portal in recent years has been phenomenal and gives students immediate access to a lot of information, not only their results but subsequently the data about the marks they got.

There are practical reasons for that and it is not just the availability of computers.  It includes the availability of plug points in schools.  There are practical reasons the seat time is needed.  If we are arranging for 120,000 students to sit an English exam in June they all have to be able to sit that exam at that time, the devices need to be there and the electricity needs to be there.

On international practice and in response to the Senator's question, a number of particular elements struck us that might be of particular importance to our work on the senior cycle.  I will draw attention to some we have not spoken about heretofore in this meeting.  One of the features we saw in our examination of international practice was greater diversification in upper secondary schools and, in particular, the fact that many jurisdictions have very clearly defined vocational pathways.  There is learning there for us in redeveloping the senior cycle.<\/p> <p>  Another area that is prominent in other jurisdictions is broader reporting.  We captured that in the advisory report.  In Ireland, as the Senator knows, reporting very much focuses on a young person's examination results.  In the discussions during the senior cycle review, time was given to thinking about the value of having broader reporting and taking account of other experiences that young people might have, including transition year and the two years leading towards the leaving certificate itself.<\/p> <p>  The review of international practice also highlighted examples of systems that encourage and support greater specialisation in terms of the subjects, modules and curriculum components a young person can choose.  Alongside that, there was also a continuing emphasis on literacy and numeracy and the importance attached to them.  That is reflected in our system now.<\/p> <p>  A final matter to which I would draw attention is that many other jurisdictions look to a greater diversity of learning environments for young people at particular stages of their education.  For example, some systems have a greater emphasis on building partnerships with local businesses and organisations in the voluntary sector.  There is also the online learning piece we have already mentioned.  Those are just some of the things that came up in our review.

I thank our guests for their presentations.  I echo some of the comments of previous speakers in thanking both the NCCA and, in particular, the SEC for the work they have done, and the quality of it, over an extremely challenging two years and under extremely pressurised circumstances.<\/p> <p>  When one contributes this late to a meeting, there is always going to be an element of repetition and that especially so in this case.  I raise the issue of T1 and T2 and echo the comments made earlier by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  We have discussed the matter at this committee and we have discussed it in detail at meetings of the Comhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, of which I am also a member.  The Irish-language community has spoken with one voice on the issue.  We have received very good evidence and suggestions, particularly from Maynooth University, about possible alternative approaches.  That needs to be looked at again.  It is something that has been raised as problematic by the Irish-language community and we should come back to that point.<\/p> <p>  Ms Forster pre-empted some of my questions by talking about the issue of broader reporting.  Certainly in the leaving certificate and the senior cycle as currently constituted, it is almost as if two approaches are being taken.  It says, on one hand, that it is a summative assessment of learning.  However, in people's imaginations and minds' eyes, it serves as a matriculation examination for entry into third level education.  It would be interesting if we could begin to separate that.  As Ms Forster said, we could be considering broader reporting.  For example, the leaving certificate is completely blind to how good a person is at group working, which is a useful skill people will carry into their later lives.  However, teachers who emphasise group working may or may not find themselves rewarded when the leaving certificate examination results arrive.  It would be interesting to look at that issue.<\/p> <p>  The issue of micro-credentialling was touched upon by Mr. Slattery when we were talking about transition year.  That is something the committee has talked about in the context of third level education.  I think straight away of the Teastas Eorpach na Gaeilge, TEG, or the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.  It would be interesting if at the end of the senior cycle, a student emerged not just with a leaving certificate result in Irish, French, Spanish and whatever else, but also with a qualification that was recognised under the common European framework.  If we are talking about pathways, once somebody is located on that common European framework, they can see a way forward.  I am thinking in particular of some of the provisions in the Acht teanga whereby we are moving towards a 20% recruitment target in the public sector and how it is most likely that a language level of B2 will be the standard we arrive at in that regard.  However, all of this will hinge on the externally moderated school-based assessments.  There has been near consensus in terms of the need to move to a more continuous assessment-based model.  That is recognised in the senior cycle review.  All of those moves are welcome but we must see closer and in more detail how it is we can structure this externally moderated school-based assessment.  We have heard those concerns expressed by the unions.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made the distinction between whether the leaving certificate is fair or not and whether it is transparent.  There is a certain level of trust in the leaving certificate and we certainly do not want to undermine that level of trust in the public eye.  That retention of trust will hinge on how we structure the externally moderated school-based assessment.  That will be the crux point.<\/p> <p>  Those amount more to comments than questions but our guests may wish to respond in any case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#Z00100","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I might start and others might respond to the questions about T1 and T2 at leaving certificate level and senior cycle.

Because we have not had formal junior cycle examinations for the past two years, this is the first cohort to come through the new specification for Gaeilge.<\/p><p>In relation to the reporting, we had the conversation earlier about the role of the leaving certificate, which is to measure attainment at the end of senior cycle, and it has this follow-on use, which is used for higher education.

I am sure Ms Forster and other colleagues will want to come in on this, and perhaps Ms Sheridan as well on this particular one.  On what works in other jurisdictions, the Deputy talked about seeing it closer and more detailed.  Actually, we need to see it closer and more detailed to come up with a system that will work here.

Again, looking at it, it is hinging on the externally based moderation piece working for this to be successful.  We all want it to be successful, because once there is a school-based assessment, it allows for greater variety and individual approaches for assessment.  However, how will this moderation be structured?  That is where we need to do the research because there are many different approaches to doing this.  For example, it could be a stand-alone statistical approach, moderation within the schools by sampling material within and across schools or a combination of both, using a statistical approach and sampling of material and getting re-marking of it by external moderators appointed by ourselves.  We need to make sure that the best blend, the hybrid or whatever approach is taken for the moderation, is the one that will work, because it is the crux of making this work and us actually trying to break the perception of the leaving certificate being the matriculation in order that the same value is put on the work of our students who are sitting the leaving certificate applied and who do not choose go to third level but choose some other pathway.  It is in working collaboration with the NCCA, looking to see what happens elsewhere and seeing, discussing and researching the different approaches and combinations of such we can bring together to ensure the most successful approach in order that the senior cycle reform is a successful change for our students in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#AA00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Sheridan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":136,"content":"<p>On the draft specifications for the T1 and T2 in leaving certificate Gaeilge, I am sure it is frustrating for the same thing being said again, but we had a great deal of data to get through, such as written submissions, online surveys, one-to-one interviews with teachers, focus groups and bilateral meetings.

When you compare the overall timelines that we work to with those internationally, you find that they are on a par.

It is fair to say it is something we - when I say \"we\" I mean as a society - hold as being very important throughout our education system because we see this emphasis on a broad and balanced educational experience, right from early years, through primary and on through post-primary to the end of senior cycle.  I would reference two things on the Deputy's point about critical thinking and creative thinking.  In 2008, when the NCCA published the five key skills for senior cycle, all the subject specifications that were either reviewed and updated, and the new specifications that have been developed - there are new subjects as part of senior cycle provision in more recent years - all build on the five key skills of senior cycle.  There is an emphasis on creative and critical thinking as part of that specification work in the past ten to 14 years.  Ms O'Connor spoke about eight guiding principles that emerged from the review of senior cycle as being very important now to guide our thinking and our work as we redevelop senior cycle.  As part of those eight guiding principles, there is an emphasis on that critical, creative thinking.  That would very much to the fore in all the NCCA's work on curriculum specifications, whether that is to do with subjects, modules, units of work or whatever the curriculum components consist of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#EE01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Arlene Forster"},{"type":"speech","time":1650927600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Are the representatives satisfied that the marking system reflects the critical thinking that is necessary?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022042600002#EE01200","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1650927600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>To build on the point, it is very much the case that the specifications for the past ten to 15 years are less content-based and much more open to allow for critical thinking.  It is becoming custom and practice in the classroom.  It is like the use of group work and pair work.  If we look at the examination paper for politics and society, in particular, and the marking scheme for it, we will see that students are being provided with the opportunity to critically think based on case studies in which they have specialised in the classroom.  That is also the case with physical education, and even with history and geography in the mid-2000s, as those new specifications came in.<\/p> <p>  The space is there.  It is not that they are doing too many subjects.  It is that the newer specifications, especially those in the past ten years are less content-driven and more about providing opportunities for learning in that critical thinking space.  The students attend, sit their examinations and demonstrate that level of engagement with critical thinking in the classroom in their examination scripts, because the exams provide the opportunity and the marking scheme then rewards what the candidate has produced in the script on the day.<\/p><p>There has been a very positive move towards that, which will be built on further and further by having the additional component at school level because that helps the students.
