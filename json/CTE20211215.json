This is the first instance in which a legitimate and lawful farming practice will be prohibited in this State.  One could be concerned that this sets a dangerous precedent for other legitimate and lawful traditional farming practices purely based on the ideological views of a select cohort.  I understand that the discussions between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the three farmers concerned have not been progressing, much to the farmers' disappointment.  The three farmers have sought to meet with the Department in recent weeks and wrote to the Minister's office directly on 17 November expressing their outstanding concerns but received no response.  The Minister reiterated in the D&aacute;il on 4 November his intention to provide for a fair and reasonable scheme of compensation for the three farmers concerned.  No one of sound mind, however, would consider what is proposed to them in the closing down of their business as fair or reasonable.<\/p><p>These amendments were also sent to the Minister's office directly by the farmers but went unanswered.  That is neither fair nor reasonable treatment of any farmer.  As discussed by the committee during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill in July of this year, the basis on which the Department's proposal to calculate the compensation entitled to the farmers, taking into account their earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, uses the worst five-year reference period.  This would give the farmers a pittance in compensation.  Farmers have asked that a longer reference period be used in order to reflect fairly and accurately the cyclical nature of their trade.  The farmers have provided the necessary financial information illustrating this to the Department.  Why is the Department opposed to considering this when it is clear that the fur trade operates in a cyclical nature and on an average of seven to ten years?  Committee members raised concerns about staff being entitled only to statutory redundancy and asked that the Minister and his officials commit to reconsidering this.  These concerns seem to have been ignored by the Department officials, who have reaffirmed that staff will be entitled only to the bare minimum statutory redundancy.  It is completely unacceptable that these workers should be punished through no fault of their own and just because they now find themselves unemployed at the hands of the Government.  Will the Minister, for once and for all, consider giving these workers a redundancy package that is fair and reflective of their services?  The farmers concerned have been left in limbo while the Department drags its heels and while there remain huge disparities in agreeing the terms of the phasing out of the practice of fur farming that would constitute fair and reasonable compensation for those involved.<\/p><p>The amendment takes into account that workers will be needed for the winding down process of each farm.

I will support the amendment proposed by Deputy Collins.  This is so important.  The county I represent has one of these farms, which are being adversely affected by the closure of its agricultural activity.  I have seen that business grow and evolve over the years and comply with the highest of regulations and European standards.  It has given employment and been very meaningful in our community, given fish farms and so on were able to work in conjunction with it.  A void is now being left, as I have explained to the Minister on numerous occasions, which is why I was opposed in the first instance to this move to shut it.  It is a very unusual development for farming of any nature to be shut, banned and outlawed for ever.<\/p> <p>  I too have been dealing with the farmers involved.  While I appreciate very much, as the Minister will be aware, the work he and his officials are doing, on 17 November he received correspondence with regard to Second Stage of the Bill, when farmers' worries and concerns at that time related to the fact the package as proposed was slow in its delivery and it had not been made meaningful to them.  Furthermore, they had concerns about the redundancy package and what was involved.  We are talking away their livelihoods and talking about operations that have been built up over decades.  A practice like that cannot be made to disappear overnight.  There are purpose-built sheds that might have absolutely no other function in farming.  They would have to be dismantled, which would involve a lot of money.<\/p> <p>  We have also to consider the livelihoods of the people who work on those farms.  I personally know fine, hard-working, genuine people who have worked on them and made their careers on them.  It has been their life&rsquo;s work and their job.  We have to bear in mind and acknowledge the enormity of what is happening here.  People's way of life, the place where they pulled up their trousers and went to work every day, is being closed.  We have to acknowledge that.  Will the Minister please take on board what is being said here today in that regard?  It is very important and farmers deserve to be treated well.  Any time the Department and the Government pull the rug from underneath somebody, there has to be some sort of a net to catch them when they fall.  As for the people in the Government who pushed for and insisted on this, let it be on their heads that they have done this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#B00900","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and all the members for ensuring Committee Stage of the Bill would be dealt with today.  I thank them also for the opportunity earlier in the D&aacute;il to comment on changes the Bill will make to the forestry industry.  That was a sensible, reasonable and practical approach to furthering that measure.<\/p> <p>  This is a significant change.  Only three or four of these farmers remain in the country.  All of them have been operating in line with the laws, regulations and practices required of them.  When the industry started, they were given State encouragement to start their enterprises.  I am very cognisant of that, but times have changed and the social acceptability of fur-farming as a practice has changed.  Indeed, the social acceptability of the use of fur in clothing is very much a changed vista as well.  As a result of that, a decision was made by the State that it was not appropriate to farm what would be naturally wild animals for their fur and to make that illegal.  Nevertheless, it is important we treat the remaining farmers with respect and fairness in recognition of the fact their livelihood is being impacted.  That is why, with this legislation, as we have discussed at earlier stages, we are seeking to ensure a fair approach will be taken in the context of compensation for those farmers and their workers.<\/p> <p>  To respond specifically to Deputy Collins's amendment, the Bill defines a redundant worker as an employee \"who was dismissed, during the period commencing 6 months before [the commencement of the Bill], and ending 6 months after, the date of commencement of [the Act]\".  This provision applies certain parameters and limits to the group of workers who will be eligible when compensation is being calculated.<\/p><p> The legislation has not been enacted by the Oireachtas yet.  We are at the first stage of that, bringing it through the D&aacute;il, then it will go through the Seanad.  Once it has gone through both Houses, it will be open to me, as Minister, to commence the legislation.  There will be a period of six months before and six months after the commencement of the legislation in which workers will be eligible for a redundancy payment as part of a compensation package to employers and farmers to provide for their workers.  The fact that it will be six months before and six months after reflects that there is seasonality to mink farming.  It covers a full calendar year.  That is proportionate and appropriate, covers the seasonality and is the right approach.  If it was 12 months, there would be a two-year window, and somebody who was made redundant 12 months before the commencement of the Act would be eligible for redundancy even though the farming could be continued in that period and there was no requirement for the farmer to stop.  First and foremost, we have to be fair to the farmers concerned, but we also have to be sensible and proportionate with regard to what we put in the legislation.  We have been more than proportionate in reflecting the 12 months of a full calendar year to ensure that we capture any seasonality associated with the close-down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#B01000","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am conscious that members are all out of the room, so I will not rush.

Obviously, the objective here is to be reasonable and fair, as I said at the outset, and to ensure appropriate and fair compensation is provided for the closure of these farms.  When we discussed Deputy Michael Collins' previous amendment, I outlined that a full 12-month period is covered.  There will be six months before a farm closes and six months afterwards, which makes up a full year.  Again, that is a reasonable and fair approach.  I did not support that amendment, as I said, because the Deputy is looking to extend the period to two years.  This would give a full year before the farm was actually shut.<\/p> <p>  On amendment No. 2 itself, I will first outline what is contained in section 71D.  The section sets out the overarching principles that will govern the compensation payable to fur farmers.  Compensation will be payable for income losses, non-income losses and costs incurred as a direct result of the prohibition.  The amount of compensation for each affected fur farming business is to be determined by an independent assessor to be appointed by the Minister.  The Bill contains principles and policies that authorise the Minister to make regulations to specify the income and non-income losses and other costs in respect of which compensation will be payable, the basis of valuation for assessing income and non-income losses, and to provide for financial limits to apply to certain compensation payments where appropriate.  Regulations will also provide compensation for the costs involved in disposing of breeding mink, demolition and clean-up costs - accommodating the likes of what Deputy Martin Browne indicated there in respect of asbestos, for payments required to be made to redundant workers - which we dealt with in the previous amendment, for certain professional fees incurred in the preparation of applicants&rsquo; claim form and in the making of representations to my Department relating to the development of this legislation.  Regulations can also be made to provide for a number of administrative matters including advanced payments to claimants prior to any final determination of their compensation entitlements under this Bill, the appointment of an assessor, the form and content of applications for compensation, information required to be furnished by applicants and any other matters that are incidental, supplemental and consequential to that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins' amendment seeks that farmers be compensated for: \"all other reasonable, necessary and consequential costs and losses so that the totality of the compensation is reasonable and fair\".  In response, I state that these overall provisions govern the compensation package that will be made available to existing fur farmers and have been developed with the benefit of expert, independent and objective financial advice.  My officials have also engaged with colleagues from other member states and have had the benefit of their experience in developing similar compensation schemes that are to apply to fur farmers in other jurisdictions.  My officials have also directly engaged with the fur farmers and their representatives on these provisions and will continue to engage with them on the specific details of the compensation scheme that will soon be provided for in the regulations.  However, for present purposes, I am very confident that the overarching loss categories provided for in this Bill are sufficient to ensure a fair and reasonable compensation package can be made available to the fur farming businesses impacted on.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  There has been much engagement.  I have met the fur farmers on at least a couple of occasions.  There has also been ongoing engagement with officials and that will continue.  Certainly, we are open to all further correspondence and to meeting them as appropriate as well.  I will also meet them as appropriate in the time ahead to discuss any further issues they have with the Bill.  There has been really comprehensive and ongoing engagement between the farmers and my officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#E00400","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>How stands the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#E00500","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am pressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#E00600","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Is the Department sticking to the figure of &euro;50 per square metre?

Were we to use a vague term that is not very clear and is really broad, which the word \"material\" is, then obviously, the capacity for that to end up in the High Court would be much higher.  The capacity to end up in the High Court is a serious step in which there are very significant costs involved for everyone concerned.  We will all be aware of many examples and instances in the past where things went to the High Court and ended up costing a multiple of what the actual point at consideration might have been.

It is a sensible approach and the most efficient approach for all of us.  It will help to achieve a worthy objective in the most reasonable timeframe we can.  The amendment is intended to facilitate the promotion of small-scale planting of native tree species in a nuanced manner.  It will not be a requirement to get a licence for an area that is larger than 0.1 ha but not greater than 1 ha and for an area that is not less than 0.1 ha but is also not greater than 20 m in width, and where the trees concerned are native tree species only, of which not more than 25% are Scot's pine.<\/p> <p>The key objective behind the amendment is to facilitate the introduction of a scheme that would allow us to incentivise more plantation of native trees.  If we have a legal basis, the Department would then have the capacity to introduce a scheme and look at incentivising farmers to do small-scale plantations and riparian zones alongside waterways, which would have an environmental benefit from the point of view of biodiversity and water quality.<\/p> <p>The largest size that does not require a licence application at the moment is 0.1 ha.  That is small and prohibitive limit that does not allow people to do much.  After much consideration of the legislation around this topic and of what would be feasible and possible within the overall framework to facilitate planting without a licence and promote native trees, we are driving legislation to enable us to run a scheme that would encourage the growth of native trees.<\/p> <p>This is in addition to, and entirely separate from, the objective to reach our commercial afforestation targets.  The target in the climate action plan is to reach 8,000 ha per year of commercial forests over the this decade.  That is important.  We have had challenges over the past year that we have been working our way out of.  We have found ourselves in an unacceptable position in respect of the number of licences being issued and the backlog that is in place.  We have been making progress in that regard but more progress is necessary.  Thankfully, the dial is now moving in the right direction.  We must keep raising the output level and improving the situation during the time ahead.<\/p> <p>This measure is separate from those considerations.  It is a worthy objective to seek to improve the number of native trees in the countryside through small forest plantations and riparian zones.  This is an important amendment that would make the process as administratively smooth as possible, without the necessity for a full-blown licence application for an area smaller than 1 ha.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#K00200","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>As I said in the D&aacute;il earlier, I agree fully with what the Minister is trying to do here.

It is also imperative that the programme for Government target for afforestation, which is to ensure we have a vibrant forestry sector going forward, is kept separate and divorced from this measure.  We have a target of 8,000 ha that we need to afforest every year.  We must keep those two targets separate.  They can be mutually beneficial as we address the challenges of climate change.

The Social Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA, has voiced concerns around the lack of detail given to the industry stakeholders regarding this amendment.  We all received messages and emails from that organisation.  What consultation took place with the industry regarding the amendment?  Will the involvement of registered foresters be mandatory for the planting of these areas?  Who is going to oversee what species of trees is being planted?  I know this has been a big issue for the Department.<\/p> <p>  How many plants per acre are being envisaged in these areas?  How will that compare to the current rates of afforestation?  When will consultation take place between the stakeholders to ensure that the measures developed will complement existing tree-planting schemes?<\/p> <p>  The species of trees involved are contained within the amendments.  The Chairman mentioned Sitka spruce not being included in that list while some strange species of trees are included.  I am not sure many people will grow native crab apple trees.

The culture is changing.  It needed to change and we need to encourage it to change.  We also need to make it as smooth and amenable as possible for those who want to plant.  In terms of small-scale afforestation, we need to encourage native trees and native tree plantations.  We can all envisage an addition to the countryside if we were to see, for example, more riparian zones alongside waterways.  That could be beneficial for the visual aspect of the countryside and, importantly, could also be beneficial for biodiversity and water quality.  That is something farmers are increasingly open to doing.  Small-scale plantations of native trees up to 1 ha can have a benefit from the point of view of biodiversity so that is why we put a lot of thought into whether this would be possible and amending the legislation around this.<\/p><p>Following on from this, if the committee and the Oireachtas decide to support providing a legal basis for such a scheme, we would proceed to develop such a scheme and engage with all representatives and those with expertise on this to ensure it is a scheme that works well and is as effective and practicable as possible for those who want to plant trees.  We would also look at an appropriate mechanism for incentivising and rewarding those who do that.  <\/p><p> This is entirely separate from afforestation targets for commercial forestry, which will be really important from a climate, emissions reduction and sequestration perspective.  It will also be really important in changing behaviour and materials usage in wider society over the next number of years, particularly in construction.  We will need to have the wood material if we are to displace some of the more emissions-intensive materials used at the moment and central to that is having the plantations.  We have a lot of work to do and getting to 8,000 ha will be really important alongside that.  This in itself is a very worthy initiative.  There is no crisis or emergency around it.

This is why we sought the committee's discretion to be able to include it in this Bill so we could consider it together, move it along and give it further consideration on Committee and Report Stages, as it goes through the Seanad and, ultimately, in enabling the scheme to be introduced after that, working really closely with the sectoral representatives, interests and stakeholders regarding the structure of this scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#K01100","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Perhaps I picked it up wrong but we were led to believe today that the number of hectares would be included in the 8,000.

I used to work in forests and above all timbers pine is probably one of the worst type of timber to grow because it grows crooked and does everything that one does not want it to do compared with spruce.  Farmers should have the option to grow spruce.  We have seen in shelter belts, and I have said this in the D&aacute;il, that one could have a spruce in a corner of a field but it could be 30 m or 40 m wide so one could go around in a semi-circle,.and one could have a few of them.<\/p> <p>  Anyone who is used to farming will know that one could have bits of land that are a few miles apart.

The provision does not seek to undermine the 8,000 ha target.  We will strive to achieve and surpass the target.  This is something that can contribute and make a positive contribution in terms of biodiversity, forestry and sequestration.

My question does not contradict my first point.  Why do we not allow people to plant the hectare in whatever way they like?  For example, if the space is along a river then it should be three trees wide.   I would promote the planting of native trees for an area along a river.

The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, stated one of the purposes is to entice farmers into forestry.  If one is not communicating with anyone in any sector, it is next to impossible to build up the confidence that would make them to do as desired.  Like other members of the committee, I must point out my serious misgivings about how an amendment to the forestry legislation is being introduced at such a late stage through completely different legislation and with no consultation.  While I support measures that will help to increase the country's forest cover, I must take issue with the way the proposed measure is being introduced.  This is representative of the poor way the industry has been treated up to now.  I got a phone call from a forester this evening who stated that what has been done was done with no proper input from the forestry sector.  According to the Society of Irish Foresters, SIF, only a small minority in the forestry industry were made aware of this legislation.  They heard about it for the first time last Friday evening.  The organisation states there has been no discussion with the industry even though there are forms available to allow for the discussion of such initiatives.  I pointed this out earlier today also.<\/p> <p>  While the primary aim of the scheme is to fulfil environmental criteria and is not related to forestry as such, it is being described as a cosmetic exercise aimed at ticking boxes and making the forestry sector seem better than it actually is.  \"Landscaping\" is one of the words that was used earlier to describe it to me.  I have a couple of questions.  What engagement did the Minister have with the forestry industry before this amendment was submitted?  Has he targets for this measure?  Can the Department tell us whether the land a farmer may wish to plant under the scheme must be used for forestry alone in the future?  I have another two questions but would like answers to those three before I ask them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#Q00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The provision is to enable us to put together a scheme, on which we would consult and engage with all interested stakeholders.  We simply would not have the capacity to put a scheme together now to encourage the small-scale planting of native woodland and trees.  I do not see how anyone could object to the proposal.  It is a sensible and logical measure.  It is about making it easier to plant forests, within reason, at a small scale.  It is something we have been considering and assessing.  There is a lot of work ongoing within the Department through Project Woodland and the various work streams to try to streamline the regulation and forestry-licensing processes as much as possible and examine what is happening internationally.  There is a lot of work ongoing in that regard.<\/p> <p>  This is one small measure that we believe could be helpful.  We felt we would like to make the most of the opportunity that exists and to give people who want to engage in the type of afforestation in question the opportunity to do so.  Currently, the bottom line is that if the area in question is more than 0.1 ha, a licence must be applied for.  This is something we believe we can change.  It is entirely sensible to change it to allow people to plant more than 0.1 ha.<\/p> <p>  There has to be a first time for everybody to hear about the measure.  Over the past few days, we engaged with the committee and informed members that we would like to proceed using this legislation.  We felt that proceeding in this way, with the co-operation of the members, would be a practical approach.  It just makes sense to move it on.  Otherwise, we would have to start with an entirely new Bill, which would understandably take longer.  It is procedurally possible to proceed as we are doing, so it is really sensible to do so.  I appreciate the unanimous decision made when we spent an hour in the D&aacute;il seeking authorisation to do this.  We are now able to discuss the matter by way of a Committee Stage amendment.  It is an efficient use of all our time.  Importantly, it is also efficient in the sense that we can develop a scheme, promptly after the passage of the legislation, that gives people the capacity to engage in afforestation and increase the proportion of native trees.<\/p> <p>  This is not a cosmetic exercise; it could make a real difference and be economically beneficial to farmers.  Most farmers, when they examine their landholding, will see spots where they could incorporate native woodland to their benefit and that of the environment around them.  The mechanism is about empowering them to do that.  It was very dismissive of whomever the Deputy was communicating to describe it as landscaping.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the scheme would be beneficial to the landscape.  It would empower farmers to make use of their land in a way that would be beneficial to the environment and biodiversity.  Allowing them to avail of the scheme would also be financially beneficial.<\/p> <p>  The amendment facilitates the planting of riparian woodland along waterways.  This can have a positive impact, in numerous instances, on water quality because it provides a natural break.<\/p> <p>  We will engage further from this point on.  The matter will be considered further on Report Stage by the members, and it will also be considered in the Seanad.  I hope that, because we are proceeding in the way we are doing, we will see what we propose alongside the enacted legislation very early in the next D&aacute;il term.

Legislatively, it is not good practice to submit amendments to members of a committee on a Friday for consideration, including a briefing, D&aacute;il debate and a select committee meeting on the following Wednesday.

That is the objective that we set out with regard to reaching the assigned carbon sequestration targets.  A hectare of forestry will contribute to that.

We are processing at least in excess of 100 per week at the moment and we are on course to meet 4,000 licences issued this year.  That is up from approximately 2,000, from memory, for last year.  That was an historic and unacceptable low.  We have made progress over the past year, especially in the second and final thirds.  There was an interruption over the summer due to a statutory requirement change and the process had to be adjusted.  We hope to push on significantly and further improve on that next year.<\/p> <p>  The legislation we introduced around this time last year enabled the capacity to put statutory timelines in place.  At the moment, the key objective is to get the number of licences up significantly and deal with the backlog.  When we achieve an equilibrium there is capacity to put statutory timelines in place but I do not have a timeline for that at the moment.  The key objective is to keep the graph going in the right direction, keep the output growing and deal with the backlog to get through it in the best timeframe we possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGS2021121500002#S00700","speaker":"1546"},{"type":"speech","time":1639526400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I welcome this scheme.  Whatever scheme the Minister and his officials are introducing, it must be simplified.  I agree with the previous speakers.  If the scheme is going to be complicated it is not going to happen.  I must be honest.  I was recently talking to somebody who was waiting three years to plant.  The Department, to be fair, granted the application but it was lost on appeal.  The Minister and his officials are serious but how then is it there was an appeal mechanism for land that was quite capable of being planted?  There were objections but if we are going to leave room for objections even to a single hectare then we are going to have problems.  People must be encouraged.  The forestry industry is on its knees.  In a few years we will not have the supply of timber and jobs in the industry, if we do not do something at this stage.  We have failed over the past year to implement the planting that we need and the licensing for people to fell their trees.  I am aware it has improved.  I must give credit where it is due; when it improves, it improves.  The Department worked hard on trying to get the licences approved.<\/p> <p>  My point is simple.  If the Minister and his officials are bringing this scheme in and they are serious about it, they should not let it be destroyed before it starts by virtue of the way they draw it up.

We passed emergency legislation then with the co-operation and support of the members here and with cross-party support.  Thankfully, we have worked ourselves into a better position but there is still a lot of work to do.

Project Woodland was established with three different project streams to look at how we can make our system work more effectively and look at what is happening internationally and try to implement any agreed changes that could improve the system.  That is ongoing.  Those project streams and work groups have been working all the time.  That is representative of all stakeholders.  Both myself and the Minister of State have had regular meetings with industry representatives as well.  Consultation has been really strong and will continue to be.
