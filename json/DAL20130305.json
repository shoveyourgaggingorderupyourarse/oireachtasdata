Child benefit is a monthly payment made on a universal basis to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or other disability.<\/p><p>  Budget 2012 maintained the child benefit rate for the first and second child at &euro;140 per month.  The monthly rate for the third child was reduced to &euro;148 and for the fourth and each subsequent child to &euro;160.  Budget 2012 also provided for the discontinuation of the grant for multiple births but we have continued the premium payments of 1.5 times the standard rate for twins and twice the standard rate for other multiples.  Budget 2013 made further reduction in child benefit rates to &euro;130 for the first, second and third child while the rate for the fourth child and subsequent children was set at &euro;140.  Budget 2013 also provides for child benefit rates to be standardised at &euro;130 for all children from January 2014. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that despite recent reductions in the child benefit rates, the current rate compares favourably with rates in, for example, 2002 when the lowest rate was &euro;117.60 or 2005 when the lowest rate was &euro;141.60.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding these changes, our expenditure and payments on child benefit remain among the highest in Europe.  Since becoming Minister for Social Protection, I have strongly defended the universality of child benefit because the State must value every child and support families.  Also, the fact that every family, regardless of their employment status, receives child benefit ensures that in the current system there is not a disincentive to work.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p><br \/> Unfortunately, it has not been possible, given the level of adjustments required, to exempt income support to families from the general budgetary strategy.  Although these measures are primarily designed to reduce overall public expenditure with a view to restoring stability to the public finances, some of the savings have been redirected towards services targeted at low-income families.  The Children Plus Initiative<i><\/i>provides for an increase of &#8364;2 million for school meals, &#8364;14 million for after-school child care and &#8364;2.5 million for an area-based child poverty initiative.  The reasons for child poverty are multifaceted.  Factors contributing to child poverty include living in lone parent households, labour market inactivity of parents, low parental educational attainment and living in households dependent on income supports.  Therefore, a multidimensional approach is required to address this issue, including not only child income supports but child related services.<\/p><p><br \/> On reductions in child poverty, the redistributive effect of social transfers, including child and family benefits, can be observed in the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children set out in the Central Statistics Office survey on income and living conditions reports.  Although it is not possible to isolate the poverty reduction effect of child benefit only - it is included with all other social transfers - the impact of social transfers in reducing child poverty is quite substantial.<\/p><p><br \/> During the period 2004 to 2010, which is the period for which the most recent data on children are available, the poverty reduction effect of social transfers rose continuously from 43% to 62%.  The most recent CSO data show that in 2011 social transfers reduced the overall at-risk-of-poverty rate for the total population by 60%.  Despite economic difficulties, of which people are aware, we have maintained payment to families at a very high level.  An estimated &#8364;1.9 billion will be paid to around 609,000 families in respect of some 1.16 million children in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500005#C00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362493200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>My reason for tabling this question is the Labour Party's promise to the electorate not to reduce child benefit.

There is a general recognition in society that families with children should be supported.<\/p><p>  On whether it has been possible to avoid all reductions, unfortunately, it has not.  When this Government took office, its predecessor had already invited in the IMF which had set in place a stringent structure in terms of how the budget would be dealt with and the conditions on which it would lend us money so that we could pay for social transfers such as child benefit, public servant salaries and health and education.

The reformed scheme will bring Ireland's support for lone parents in line with international provisions where there is a general movement away from long-term and passive income support and towards helping people to have life chances and choices in respect of education, training and employment with a view to financial independence for themselves and their children.<\/p><p>I am very conscious that the changes to the one-parent family payment scheme highlight the need for additional supports for lone parents that will be affected by these reforms.

This is a particular problem during an economic downturn as young people tend to suffer the impact of job losses more than any other age group.  It is estimated that approximately 7.5 million young people are neither in education, employment or training - the so-called NEETs group - across the EU.<\/p><p>This is an issue that needs urgent and concerted attention at an EU level and one that the Irish Government identified as a core agenda item of the Irish EU Presidency.<\/p><p> Under my chairmanship, the Council of Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Ministers, known as EPSCO, last week agreed a recommendation on an EU-wide youth guarantee.  The EPSCO recommendation is that each member state should ensure that young people receive a quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed, subject to registering with the unemployment services in their own country.  The recommendation will now move to be considered for formal adoption by the Council at a later stage in Ireland's Presidency, most likely in May. <\/p><p> The recommendation encourages member states to implement its provisions as soon as possible once it is formally adopted.  It is also recognised that implementation will need to be more gradual in countries with higher levels of youth unemployment and particularly severe budgetary problems.<\/p><p> In anticipation of the formal adoption of the recommendation, the Government will review the current range of youth employment and training policies in Ireland to assess what measures will need to be taken to commence the gradual implementation of the guarantee.  In the budgetary negotiations, a sum of &euro;6 billion over the lifetime of the multi-annual financial framework has been set aside, the first time that this has been done for this specific heading.  Although this is not as much money as I would have liked, it is, in itself, is a progressive step.<\/p><p> It is hoped this framework pathway for young people to get education, training and, ultimately, employment will be the beginning of a sustained downward movement in youth unemployment as the economy recovers.  Even so, the implementation of a guarantee will certainly require an expansion in the range of opportunities currently on offer to young people in the form of further education, training, internships, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for self-employment.<\/p><p> In this regard, the State already provides a significant number of places which are available to young people.  The Department of Social Protection took steps in budget 2013 to increase funding and places for schemes such as JobBridge, community employment, T&uacute;s and a new State employment scheme in the local government sector.  In total, an additional 10,000 places will be provided.  The Department of Education also made provision for the new momentum programme which is providing 6,500 new training places, many of which will be taken up by young people.  A new recruitment incentive, JobsPlus, has also been developed by my Department and was approved by the Government as part of the Action Plan for Jobs.  This incentive will cover the cost of employers' PRSI contributions.  The current period is 18 months and that will be extended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500013#L01700","answer":true,"speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362496500,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I welcome the proposal although it is a pity that the EU has not had the urgency to date to deal with this issue, but it is better late than never.

Under that scheme, if participants are lucky, the employers they are placed with provide training.  What happens at the end of this process?  Are young people guaranteed a placement for six months or a year and is there a danger of simply shifting people off and back onto the live register?  Obviously, the Minister will be addressing such issues in the coming months but I ask her to give us some further guidelines on the proposal because I do not want to be negative about this.

With young people new to the labour market, there are not that many jobs available and in a depressed market, they face particular problems.  I have met regularly the EU Commissioner responsible for social affairs and fellow Ministers across Europe, impressing on them that it is difficult to envisage a social Europe that would countenance an unemployment rate of 50% and over in some of the countries facing severe economic difficulties.<\/p><p>  The agreement based on the work done in particular by Eurofound, a foundation headquartered in Ireland that deals with living and working conditions, has focused on young people who are not in education, employment or training.

We will know the outcome of that after the European Parliament deliberates with the Council President.

Prior to the changes I have been making, the Department of Social Protection was largely a passive Department.  If one qualified for a payment, one received it and could be left alone forever after.

We have garda&iacute;, health care workers, nurses, emergency medical technicians, Army personnel and many more who seem to have been singled out for particular treatment.  The situation for those workers is deeply unfair.  Adding to that unfairness, side deals are being done on an ongoing basis.  Fire personnel and prison officers are retaining double pay on a Sunday while their front-line colleagues, the garda&iacute;, EMTs and nurses, are being treated in a much more vindictive way.<\/p><p>  A health care assistant on a gross income of &euro;27,000 per annum faces a cut of 8%, meaning a reduction in his weekly pay packet of &euro;50.  Workers earning between &euro;150,000 and &euro;185,000 are getting the same percentage cut as the health care worker on &euro;27,000.  That is not fair.  The reason for it is because the entire deal revolves around the make-up of a person's pay.  Two people on the same income according to their payslips at the end of a week will see a considerably different impact on their take-home pay as a result of this deal, depending on how it is made up between core pay and shift work premiums.<\/p><p>There are thousands of shift workers who are on low pay and who work in the front-line services and part of their normal core hours is to work Sunday and night-time.  They depend on the premium payments they receive from these hours as part of their normal pay and would have secured their mortgages on that basis.  I would ask the Taoiseach a basic question.  Why has the Government decided to single out these workers - healthcare workers, garda&iacute;, emergency medical technicians, nurses, Army personnel - for such unfair treatment as a result of this deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500017#P00900","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362498000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin should reflect on the situation that has evolved here.  In view of the requirement to have an extra &euro;3 billion of savings by 2015, the take from public pay is &euro;1 billion between now and 2015, as 35% of spending goes on the public pay bill.<\/p><p>  The situation is that the unions and management negotiated this over a number of weeks and the LRC put forward its propositions to the unions for their consideration, analysis and decision.  It is normal procedure, where unions negotiate on behalf of their members, that letters of clarification issue to unions about specific issues, and that is what has happened here.  Nobody is being treated unfairly here.  I suggest that the best course of action is to allow the period of reflection and analysis that unions require so that they can discuss this with their members and make their decision in the way that unions do, each in its own voting pattern.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the LRC paper will achieve a good balance of equity across public servants given the complexity and range of diversity of public service roles.  Essentially, they seek to ensure that those who earn most pay most.  Those earning over &euro;65,000 are facing direct pay cuts and those cuts are progressive - up to 10% for those who earn in excess of &euro;185,000.  While those earning under &euro;65,000 will have delays in increments, they will not have their pay cut directly.  The elements of the LRC paper have been set out.  While all public servants are asked to make a contribution, those who can best afford it are being asked to make the biggest contribution.<\/p><p>  Front-line staff complained that they were being targeted and it is now clear that they are not being targeted.  Their Saturday premia have been retained and the unions in the talks successfully mitigated the proposed reduction in Sunday premia, which is from double time to time and three quarters.  Other sectors made significant and proportionate contributions to the overall savings, including teachers and prison officers.  It is clear that all public service workers take some impact in this agreement, not only front-line workers.  I would suggest that the process is well underway for unions to consider, analysis and decide on their view on the Labour Relation Commission paper, and I hope that they do that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Martin will be aware that we made numerous comments about the importance of staying in at the negotiations and discussions.  It is clear that the unions that stayed there made an impact in terms of adjustments.  The Minister has made it clear that the provisions of the agreement relating to pay, productivity and reform, assuming that they are ratified, will apply to everybody and nobody is being treated unfairly in this context.

That is not fair.  On any analysis of a deal, people have an obligation to face up to the realities.  As I stated, there are thousands of shift workers on low incomes who will suffer much more than anybody else as a result of this deal.  They are earning under &euro;65,000.  I have instanced the healthcare worker.  Middle-ranking nurses will face a loss of up to &euro;80 per week, and middle-ranking garda&iacute; as well.<\/p><p>  It seems there is a cynicism at the heart of how this has been organised in terms of the strategy of ensuring that the Government gets the votes to get the deal over the line.  The Taoiseach's comments speak to that cynicism in the sense of the divide and conquer strategy, where the approach was that the Government would ensure those who left the talks early would be punished.  For example, how can the Government speak of equalising start-up pay for teachers but expect nurses to start their careers at 80% of the basic income?  An Army private is losing anything up to 14% while a general is losing 5%.  There are clear inequities in how this is working out for many on low incomes.  The Taoiseach should look at that.  There is the business of the Government doing a side deal with the fire brigade and its staff can have their double pay on a Sunday, but garda&iacute;, notwithstanding all their difficult work, and that they put their lives on the line, it will not get the same treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500018#Q00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1362498000,"counter":119,"content":"<p>It is disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500018#Q00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1362498000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>That is what is going on here.

As has been pointed out on a number of occasions, this has actually allowed some more time for reflection on the best approach in this case.

He is chairing the committee dealing with the appropriateness of the centenary celebrations.  I know that a number of serious elements are involved in this.

In the past I have had to advise people from abroad that the site of 14-17 Moore Street is not at the moment what one would expect if one were to go to look at the location where the first fledgling steps towards economic and political independence were taken.

After days of fighting, they withdrew from the GPO and made their way into Moore Street.  I cannot think of anywhere else in the world, whatever the complexion of the politics, where there would be such an iconic site in the state it is in at present.  I believe it is evidence of the state we are in and is more evidence of the counter-revolution which followed 1916 than the actual revolution which was bravely proclaimed in the Proclamation.<\/p><p>  I have met the relatives of the 1916 leaders, as I am sure has the Taoiseach.  I met them as recently as last Thursday and I share their concerns.  I have seen the very slick video produced by a developer who wants to produce a huge shopping mall in the capital city, which we do not need.  The battlefield site would be destroyed as part of that.  I would like the Taoiseach to use an Ulster expression and just say &quot;No&quot; to the developer.

I know he has been very busy but I cannot imagine the Taoiseach would not meet the families of Connolly, Pearse, MacDonagh, MacDermott and so on out of respect for what their loved ones who were executed at that time sacrificed for the people of this island.

While there, I availed of the opportunity to have a number of bilateral meetings, including with Prime Minister Stoltenberg of Norway and Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt of Denmark.  During these meetings, I emphasised Ireland's efforts to make legacy bank debt more sustainable and set out the priorities of the Irish Presidency.  In addition, I outlined the difficulties we have faced in our economy and the sacrifices made by our people.<\/p><p>  I also attended a lunch meeting hosted by Prime Minister Stoltenberg for the Heads of State or Government attending the Nobel ceremony, as well as Presidents Van Rompuy, Barroso and Schulz.  I met Presidents Van Rompuy, Barroso and Schulz a number of times during recent months on Presidency related issues, most recently Presidents Barroso and Schulz in Dublin on Thursday last, 28 February.  These meetings focused in the main issues on the current EU agenda, especially the Union's future budget.  I also used these opportunities to update the Presidents on the Irish economic situation, including on our banking related debt.<\/p><p>  Last Thursday's meeting focused on the next steps on the EU's multi-annual financial framework.  We also touched upon the agenda of this month's European Council, strengthening economic and monetary union and the work of the Irish Presidency.  As a courtesy, Prime Minister Cameron telephoned me before he delivered his speech in the UK and the EU on 23 January to brief me in general terms on its contents.

The EU heads of mission Jerusalem report was handed to EU governments in January and I wrote to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste about it last week.  The report finds that Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank are the biggest single threat to the two state solution.  It finds Israeli policy to be systematic, deliberate, provocative and aimed at making it impossible for Jerusalem to become the capital of two states.  The report concludes the Israeli Government is pursuing a deliberate policy of seeking to drive Palestinians out of east Jerusalem through restrictive zoning and planning, demolitions, excavations, discriminatory access to religious sites, an inequitable education policy, little access to health care and inadequate provision of resources.  It identifies some settlement construction on the southern flank of east Jerusalem as being the most significant and problematic.<\/p><p>  As we do not have time I will not take the Taoiseach through the rest of the report which, coming from EU heads of mission, calls on the EU to prevent, discourage and raise awareness of the problematic implications of financial transactions, including foreign direct investment from within the EU in support of settlement activities, infrastructure and services.  It recommends the EU, which is Israel's largest import and export market, take sanctions against settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank.  This is under our Presidency and I ask the Taoiseach to act on these recommendations.  What steps have been taken since he received the report?  Does he support the recommendations?<\/p><p>  A Palestinian prisoner, Arafat Jaradat, a young man who was arrested for throwing a stone, died and the Palestinian authorities allege he was tortured.  This situation was exacerbated because two children were killed and two Palestinian-only bus lanes were launched.  There are 4,500 Palestinian prisoners.  Under our Presidency and given our history of peace making and conflict can these issues be raised?  Has the Taoiseach read the report?  Will he act on the recommendations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500021#T00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1362499800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>At each European Council meeting a report has been given on the Syrian question by the EU High Representative, Baroness Catherine Ashton, which outlines the devastating consequences of the conflict.  I have not had time to read the report to which the Deputy referred but I have it in my office.  The conflict in Syria, as the Deputy is well aware, has been a major priority for the European Union for the past two years.  Latest UN estimates put the death toll in Syria at up to 70,000, including more than 500 children.  At least 2 million Syrians have been displaced internally and a further 2 million are in serious need of humanitarian assistance.  The High Representative has given evidence that the Christian population in particular has suffered unprecedented attacks.  A total of 820,000 Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries as refugees from the violence.  During the Presidency the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Affairs and Trade is treating this as a major priority and recently discussed the question with Secretary of State Kerry.  We will fully support the efforts of the EU High Representative on this issue and we will use our influence in so far as we can to advance the efforts of the Union to bring about a political solution to the conflict and deal effectively with the humanitarian fallout.<\/p><p>  We must continue to focus our efforts on finding a way to end the violence and initiate a political process.  We are supportive of the mediation efforts led by the UN Arab League joint special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, in search of a political breakthrough and we call on the political opposition in Syria led by the Syrian National Coalition to work more closely with the special envoy.  We also welcome the initiative by the president of the Syrian National Coalition, Sheikh al-Khatib, in proposing direct talks with the Syrian regime and the ongoing diplomatic efforts to give effect to this initiative and promote the beginning of dialogue which might lead to a peace process.<\/p><p>  During its Presidency of the EU, Ireland will remain actively engaged in addressing the appalling humanitarian situation which has arisen since the crisis began.  The Government allocated an additional &euro;4.7 million in Irish Aid funding and emergency supplies to help meet the needs of some of the civilian population in Syria.  This brings the total value of the Irish Government's response to the crisis to just over &euro;7 million.  We have been very supportive of efforts to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.  We have been at the forefront of EU efforts in this regard and will continue to be so.  When I had the privilege of meeting former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in Dublin we discussed this in the course of our conversation and when she left Government Buildings it was to proceed to a direct discussion with the special envoy, Mr. Brahimi, on the question in Syria.<\/p><p>  At the Davos World Economic Forum a contribution was made by Javier Solano who stated Europe in particular must look at what is happening across the Mediterranean because the situation is evolving globally and there may well be a requirement for far more focused and more detailed analysis of how Europe should look at its relationship with the entire Middle East in the time ahead.  The two state solution has been a central feature of this for many years, but starting with the Arab spring the focus has moved around the perimeter of the Mediterranean and Syria, unfortunately and tragically, is a very bad case.  In so far as Ireland is concerned, as a member of the Union and as the holder of the Presidency we will proceed in respect of the actions I have mentioned.  I suggest the Deputy tables a Topical Issue matter on the specific issue of the report and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade would be happy to respond to it, or on the next occasion we have questions I will be able to answer the Deputy in greater detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500021#T00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362499800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I have tabled 11 of the 22 questions being taken.  I will not get to all of them but I hope I have another opportunity to speak later.  Last week I raised with the Taoiseach the fact that the European Central Bank earns more than &euro;500 million per year in profits from the holding of Irish bonds.  Six months ago the European Central Bank agreed to return all profits on Greek bonds to Athens.  Ireland and other countries forced out of the market by current EU policies have a clear right to be treated in the same way.  The original reduction on the interest rates on loans occurred because of a decision taken on the Greek situation.<\/p><p>The current alleviation of debt in terms of Portugal and Ireland is welcome, but it follows the Portuguese initiative on the basis of what happened to Greece.  Last week, I asked the Taoiseach whether he had formally asked for the ECB profits on Irish bonds to be returned to Ireland.  He was not in a position to answer the question then but said he would seek information from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and would then inform the House of the result.  So I am asking again, has the Taoiseach formally asked for the ECB profits on Irish bonds to be returned to Ireland or not?<\/p><p> The Taoiseach has declined to say anything regarding the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron's position on a possible exit of his country from the EU, other than that he did not want this to happen and that it would be bad for Ireland.  We do not necessarily want it to happen and know that it would be bad for Ireland.  However, will we do anything to prevent it from occurring?  Given that we are looking at the potential exit of our largest trading partner within the EU, have we commissioned any studies - beyond the general to the specific - on the impact of such a decision if the UK was to proceed along that path?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500021#T00400","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362500400,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy mean in respect of stopping a potential referendum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500022#U00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362500400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>No.  I am referring to quantifying the impact of a British exit on the Irish economy.

That decision is in line with the envisaged transparency stance for the outright monetary transactions, as was communicated on 6 September 2012.   At that time, the securities markets programme was terminated.  That showed total holdings on 31 December 2012, with a nominal value of &#8364;218 billion, comprising Italian, Greek, Spanish, Portuguese and Irish bonds.  Of this total, Irish bonds amounted to &#8364;14.2 billion nominal value with an average remaining maturity of 4.6 years.  The statement did not include any estimate of any profit which the ECB may or may not realise on such bonds.  However, the ECB also raised its annual accounts on 21 February.  The press release accompanying that showed that the ECB's total interest earnings on a securities market programme, and its holdings of Irish, Greek, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bonds in 2012, was &#8364;1.1 billion.  The statement confirmed that some &#8364;555 million of this interest arose from its holdings on Greek bonds, which amounted to &#8364;33.9 billion.  The remaining &#8364;463 million of the ECB's SMP interest earnings arose from its combined holdings of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Irish bonds.<\/p><p><br \/>  We should be cognisant of the fact that the ECB is bound by its obligations under the EU treaties and that member states must respect that.  The package of measures that was agreed for Greece on 26 November 2012 by eurozone finance Ministers was designed to put the Greek economy on a path to sustainable growth and its domestic finances on a sound footing.  That package was agreed in the context of the statement by the euro area Heads of State and Government that the scale of the Greek problem was so large that it required special attention.  <\/p><p><br \/>  It is important to note that the concessions that were agreed specifically for Greece were accompanied by a significant additional conditionality.  One of the measures that was proposed in November - the SMP profits measure - will see member states pass on to Greece's segregated account an amount equivalent to the income on the SMP portfolio that would eventually accrue to their national central banks as from budget year 2013.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Member states under a full financial assistance programme, such as Ireland, are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they receive financial assistance.  Ireland is obviously in a very different position from Greece.  Our programme is working.  We have completed 190 agreed targets and have surpassed many, including our annual deficit targets.  Growth has returned to the economy and I welcomed last week's figures showing positive employment growth.  Furthermore, as a country exiting a programme, our situation cannot be seen as comparable to Greece.  We continue to examine the Greek package to see if any aspects of it offer any possible benefit to Ireland, particularly in regard to our exit.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In January, EU finance Ministers agreed that the request made by Portugal and Ireland for an extension of the maturities of their loans from the EFSF and the EFSM would be considered by senior officials before coming back to finance Ministers for further consideration.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Deputies will be aware that we have had some positive news recently: the elimination of the promissory notes in IBRC; the sale of the Bank of Ireland contingent convertible capital notes<font color=\"#222222\">, known as <\/font>Cocos; the recent sale of Irish Life; and, just this week, the announcement of the ending of the bank guarantee.  These are significant milestones on this country's way back to recovery.  Obviously, we still have important and necessary decisions to take as is evidenced by the recent agreement on public sector pay, but Ireland is continuing to restore the damage done and is returning to more normal circumstances, albeit not without risks along the way.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would recall the benefits we have already received, notably assistance in the form of a reduction of interest rates and extended maturities.  In addition, last June, the Heads of State and Government agreed on breaking the link between banks and sovereign.  They made explicit reference to Ireland in that decision.  It is important to remember that Ireland is exiting a programme and we should have regard to what we need to assist that exit, rather than focusing solely on measures that are provided for a country in very different circumstances than ours.<\/p><p><br \/>  As Deputy Martin is aware, the ECOFIN group under the chairmanship of the Minister for Finance has been discussing this matter today.  While the situation has been agreed in principle, clearly the troika needs to analyse the details of that.  If it is agreed, it has to be put to each country.  In the context of extending the maturities of the loans given to both Portugal and Ireland, this would be of further significant benefit to us as we make our way to exiting this programme.  These moneys from European institutions are at lower interest rates than we could achieve on the markets, and therefore a longer extension of that would be of benefit to us.  However, it is too early to make a definitive statement about it until these matters are finished.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy asked whether we have done an analysis on the impact of the potential exit of the UK from the EU, were that to be decided by the British Government and the British people.  I have already said that this would be of the most serious import for this country and, indeed, in the context of the European Union.  I expect to devote some of our time to this matter next week when I meet with the British Prime Minister in London.  Britain is our closest neighbour and biggest trading partner, as well as being close in so many other respects.  I would not like to see a situation where Britain decided to leave the European Union.  As a founder member of the Single Market, this must be seen in the context of discussions that will take place under the Irish EU Presidency on trade issues with Japan, Singapore, Canada and other countries.  Hopefully, we will also get a mandate to start the negotiations on EU-US trade talks once Ireland's EU Presidency is finished.  If we get that mandate during our EU Presidency, the talks would commence subsequent to our EU Presidency.  The figures, however, indicate the possibility of the creation of at least 2 million jobs in Europe, with the opportunity to increase economic growth in the various countries by up to 3%.  I intend to discuss these issues with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500022#U00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362500400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Has the Taoiseach commissioned any such studies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500022#U00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1362500400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>We have not carried out an analysis on the impact of it.

Will he explain that instead of telling the troika that it was unsustainable to continue to pay the debt it insisted was put on the shoulders of the Irish people to salvage its financial system with the savage austerity that it imposes on the people, the Taoiseach turned around and extended the time for repayment in order that it becomes like a war reparation situation, whereby not just the present generation but generations yet unborn will be carrying the debt?  Can the Taoiseach justify this please?  In respect of the promissory notes and the changes that were made there, Members never heard what will be the total cost to the Irish people over the 40 years or so that this arrangement will spin out.  Equally, can the Taoiseach tell me what are the cost implications for what was announced this morning in regard to the total bill the people will pay, whether it is over 12 years, ten years or a further 15 years added on to that?<\/p><p>  Second, I have read that for the European Union Presidency, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, has stored a virtual lake of a fine French wine, Lynch Bages, at &euro;80 per bottle.  The elite of Europe who are coming here to drink that fine wine are the ones who are demanding savage austerity on the Irish people.  Would it not be more appropriate perhaps to serve them chilled buttermilk instead of fine expensive wine, which is a further burden on the Irish people and thereby make them practice what they preach a little?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500023#V00100","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501000,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that at the working lunch I had the other day with the Swedish and Norwegian Prime Ministers, cool clear water is what was on offer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500023#V00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501000,"counter":247,"content":"<p>As befits the Scandinavians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500023#V00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501000,"counter":248,"content":"<p>However, I think it appropriate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should have available some refreshment for international visitors of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500023#V00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>High repute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500023#V00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>-----connection with this country.

I assure the Deputy that the Government and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade are highly conscious of the requirement to be realistic in expenditure these days, much more so than what happened in the past.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me what is the role of the leaders in respect of our debt.  The Deputy is aware of the process and, as a former Member of the European Parliament, knows what it is like.  These matters go through a process until they come eventually to the Heads of State and Government for decision.  In between, it may be necessary to have contact on an occasional or bilateral basis with individual leaders from other countries.  However, the case must be put by an individual leader or Head of Government at the Council meeting to have something either adopted unanimously or agreed in whatever form.  This is what happened in the case of the decision of 29 June 2012, where all the preparatory work was gone through by the permanent representatives, that is, the public officials.  While it went through the process of Ministers for Finance, it was agreed by leaders.  I did not describe this as a great breakthrough this morning.  What I did say was it would be of considerable benefit to the country, were it to be agreed.  I cannot foresee the conclusion of the discussions that will take place.  As I stated, Commissioner Rehn stated this morning that were this to be agreed, it would happen at the meeting here in Dublin next month.  Clearly however, Deputy Higgins should be aware there is quite a long way to go in this regard.  The troika must carry out its analysis of the details of how this will work in respect of the different loans, the maturities and when they are due and so on.  Moreover, it will be necessary for this to be adopted by each member state.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me what is the benefit of extending maturities.  Potentially, it is highly significant and will be beneficial for Ireland as it will reduce the amount the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will be obliged to re-finance on the debt markets in those years in which the loans originally were due to be repaid.  I speak now in respect of the extension already agreed here.  In addition, the cost of such term loans from the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, is likely to be lower than what Ireland would be obliged to pay in the debt markets, given the superior credit rating of these institutions of Europe in the coming years.  It will be cheaper for Ireland to hold onto that.  This is particularly important as there are significant amounts of existing non-European Union-IMF debt maturing between 2015 and 2020 and accordingly, an extension of those maturities would be viewed positively by the debt markets and therefore would benefit Ireland's overall cost of borrowing.<\/p><p>  That decision serves as an example of the progress the Government has made and is making at European level in reducing the cost of the European Union-IMF programme entered into by the previous Administration.  Some of the issues that have happened in this regard, such as the replacement of the promissory notes, the liquidation of IBRC, the agreement on 29 June last and the specific reference to improving the sustainability of the programme here, are issues that are relevant to us.  Moreover, Ireland will not be obliged to repay principal on promissory notes until 2038, which gives us a real opportunity to get our house in order, to have our economy well run and to have a prosperous country in which we can really focus on the question and the challenge of creating jobs.  I listened to President Clinton when he visited two years ago when he made the point that the historical fact about every country that goes through a recession is that when it is over, it takes at least ten years to make that benefit filter down to people on the ground in the context of creating jobs.  He stated the challenge for Ireland was to short-circuit that and to prove it can have real benefit from exiting a programme, restoring its public finances and getting its economy back to good health but to focus on the creation of jobs and not to have a so-called jobless recovery.<\/p><p>  This is a challenge about which this House and Oireachtas have a lot of ideas.  The Government is willing to act in the interests of getting people off the live register, of making decisions that will increase flexibility and access to credit for small businesses in order that jobs can be created and to retain the strong elements of what we already have.  I refer to both Enterprise Ireland, in terms of exports and jobs being created here and in other countries but with profits accruing to Ireland, as well as to the continued line of strong foreign direct investment into Ireland, further evidence for which was demonstrated today.  Deputy Higgins should be aware this is the really big challenge for the country.  It must sort out its public finances and put its economy into a place where it is growing and becoming prosperous but must do so with a direct beneficial impact on the creation of jobs.  The extension of maturity dates would be of benefit to Ireland with regard to the cost of its borrowing and the sustainability of its capacity to repay, as well as by giving the Government the opportunity to make decisions to grow job numbers and to give the people hope, confidence and real benefits by short-circuiting what has happened in other countries on a regular basis.<\/p><p>That is what we will focus on for the next period, to see how we can really create jobs and get people off the live register.  The Minister for Social Protection is making a huge structural change to give effect to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500023#V00800","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362501600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Does the Taoiseach not realise that ordinary people in this country are sick of hearing constant announcements about progress on restoring the public finances and announcements such as we have had over recent weeks about great deals for stringing out the period over which we must pay these enormous debts, declared as victories and reasons to celebrate, when there is no commitment to anything to alleviate the burden of cuts and austerity inflicted on those citizens this year, next year and the year after?  The truth is that extending maturities makes no difference to the fact that this year we will pay over &euro;8 billion in interest on this massive debt on which the Government will not even ask for a write-down.  We will continue to pay that enormous level of interest on this utterly unsustainable debt year on year for years to come.  Almost as much as the education budget is being paid out in interest on a debt largely either not ours at all or not the responsibility of ordinary citizens in that it resulted from a collapse engineered by others.  That is the problem and unless the Government addresses that we will be bled dry.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach rightly suggests that we are facing into a decade of this misery, of bumping along the bottom with mass unemployment, negligible growth and no prospect of improving that situation if this money continues to be drained out of us year on year.  In the Taoiseach's discussions with other European leaders and in his statements about likely improvements in our financial situation when he says we will meet the 3% target and that will be the end of it, then the worst will be over, why does he not admit that will not be the case because when we reach the 3% target we immediately come under the demands of the fiscal referendum?  Even though there is a three year time gap we will be required under that treaty to move towards 0.5% and will be required to reduce this debt of &euro;200 billion by half, paying one twentieth per year, requiring billions of extra cuts and austerity after we meet the 3% debt target.  We are facing into a decade of further cuts to pay off these debts and to meet the deficit targets.  Where is the relief?  Where is the light on the horizon for ordinary people given the requirements to which the Taoiseach has signed up and committed?<\/p><p>  I do not think the Taoiseach should be light-hearted about the wine bill.  Can he explain the wine bill that has been built up under his Government in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  Why has the wine bill for the year that he came into office quadrupled?  The amount spent by the T&aacute;naiste's Department in the year that the Government came into office quadrupled.  It appears that we now need four times more wine than we needed in the last year of the previous Government to entertain the great and the good of Europe.  Is our strategy to get them a bit tipsy in the hope that they will give us the break in respect of our debt that we have not succeeded in getting from them?  It is unconscionable that faced with the level of austerity being inflicted on ordinary people, we have to spend four times more on wining and dining delegates from Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500024#W00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>It might be better if Deputies were to table questions of that nature to the individual Ministers so that they can get a proper answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500024#W00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>That might be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500024#W00400","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362501600,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Priority Questions to the Taoiseach have become a comprehensive debate and those who have genuine questions down are not getting answers.

My point was that former President Clinton said that the challenge for Ireland was to short-circuit what has happened in most other places.  He said we have the capacity to do this because the big decisions that are made about our programme, exiting the programme, improving our debt sustainability, having cash flow because of the decisions made to extend the maturities of the promissory notes and hopefully, the discussions arising in respect of other loans will give us that breathing space.  That is why the Government is focusing on the decisions for investment and changes to structures that will allow for a much more immediate impact on the people whom I and Deputy Boyd Barrett represent who are on the live register, want to be employed and to contribute, and who at the moment, for one reason or another, might not have a great degree of confidence about finding a job.  The Minister for Social Protection is changing the structure so that the way in which the Intreo offices deal with people on the live register is fundamentally different from what applied in the past.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware the IMF-EU programme was for &euro;85 billion.  That is what we inherited two years ago this week.  The programme for Government set out very clearly to make decisions to deal with that public financial problem to change the structures for the way in which we make decisions and do business.  That &euro;85 billion was made up of &euro;17.5 billion from our own resources, cash reserves in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, &euro;22.5 billion from the IMF extended loan facility, &euro;22.5 billion from the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, &euro;22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and &euro;17.7 billion in bilateral loans, including &euro;3.8 billion from the United Kingdom, &euro;0.6 billion from Sweden and &euro;0.4 billion from Denmark.  It is in our interest to extend the loans from the EFSF and the EFSM because they are borrowed at lower than market rates to give us the capacity to have cash flow to invest in business and therefore create profit for the country and the economy.  The EFSF accounts for just under &euro;18 billion of programme funding and to date Ireland has availed of almost &euro;13 billion of that in six tranches with original maturities ranging from 3.1 years to 29 years.  That is what the troika will examine in the case of the loans, their rates and the dates of maturity.  The EFSM accounts for &euro;22.5 billion of the programme and we have availed of &euro;21.7 billion of that in nine tranches with original maturities ranging from five to 30 years.<\/p><p>  While the Deputy might not think it, most of the external funds borrowed were used for the provision of public services such as health and education and social protection and most of the funds that were used to recapitalise the banks have come from the NPRF.  What has been borrowed from abroad from those institutional funds was for our people, for education, health, social protection services and wages.<\/p><p>I am sure even Deputy Boyd Barrett would not want that not to have happened.<\/p><p> Some &euro;3.6 billion of the EFSF loans will fall to be repaid within the next three years, with an additional &euro;5 billion of ESM debt maturing.  This, along with the existing debt securities, places pressure on the State, through the NTMA, to borrow the money on the debt markets at that time.  That is the reason why, in respect of these matters, we are hopeful of further progress.  I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that because it happened to others, we are condemned to bobbing along the bottom in a decade of misery.  These are challenging times for everyone but it will not get better unless the Government works with colleagues in Europe and makes decisions here in the interests of all our people.  The public pay talks are important so that everyone, from the highest to the latest recruit, puts their shoulders to the wheel and makes a contribution.  In many cases, the contributions are challenging and difficult to make.  It is in the interests of our country and in the interest of the generation behind us to sort that out.  The decisions of Government must be as fair as possible across the board.  I do not accept the assertion of Deputy Boyd Barrett of being confined to a decade of what he described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500024#W01000","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362502200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>It was my intention to ask a different supplementary question but the Taoiseach did not answer my question.

The Presidency of the EU will last six months, which will quickly pass.  After that period, if the Taoiseach wants to reflect on what big thing he has done, there is nothing better than to have taken the report produced by EU heads of mission for the EU and ensured it is on the cl&aacute;r of the summits and discussions the Taoiseach is involved with.  Dealing with the clear recommendations, which are entirely within the remit of the EU, will greatly assist in trying to bring some sense to what is happening in the Middle East.  Without significant international intervention, the situation will only get worse.  I am no prophet of doom; I am from the optimistic wing of politics but it is certain the situation will only get worse.  The Taoiseach has visited the region and I have been there a few times, including a visit to Gaza.  I always come away with a sadness because leadership is lacking.  We need people from outside the bloc to come in and take lateral action.  The ball is with the Taoiseach.

What we have essentially today in the first item on the Order of Business is an attempt to do just that in the context of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill.  A total of 67 amendments have been tabled to the Bill.  However, only two and a half hours has been allocated for the entire Committee Stage.  There is no emergency at issue.  Approximately three minutes is provided for debate on each amendment.  The vast majority of the Bill will not be debated because the Government is unnecessarily guillotining the debate, as it did with the original Bill before Christmas, when only three of the 88 amendments were discussed.  The Government has had to bring forward an amending Bill because of the rushed nature of the Bill before Christmas.  On this side of the House we are putting forward a range of amendments to provide exemptions or relief for certain categories.  Notwithstanding our belief that this is the wrong tax at the wrong time, we wish to table an amendment that households in mortgage arrears would be exempt.

We will not get an opportunity to debate those amendments.  The same thing happened with the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill before Christmas and now it is going to happen again.

He is allowing just over two minutes each for 67 amendments.  That is utterly unacceptable.  He did exactly the same prior to Christmas when only three of 88 amendments were discussed.  It is absolutely undermining and eroding the democratic process in the most cynical way.  The Government Members smile like Cheshire cats when they do this because they think it is funny.  However, undermining the democratic process is not funny.  It is bad enough that the Government is doing this to the citizens of this country but to refuse to allow proper debate and scrutiny of the legislation by the public and the D&aacute;il is outrageous beyond belief.

During his time in political life, Shane McEntee did an outstanding job for Ireland for the people he represented.  Elected in a famous by-election in 2005, Shane brought huge energy, enthusiasm and sincerity to his new role as a public representative.  His commitment to the people of Meath was unparalleled.  The huge outpouring of grief and sorrow at his passing bears testament to the great esteem in which he was held both in his home county and nationally.  His qualities were the ones he utilised brilliantly in his role as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, where his dedication to duty was so widely recognised.<\/p><p><br \/>  He did not confine his work to the field of agriculture and food.  He was also, of course, a very strong champion for those homeowners affected by the pyrite issue and shortly before he died he succeeded in having these homes exempted from the local property tax.  Nowhere was his incredible commitment and passion more obvious than on this issue.  It is my sincere hope that his successor will carry on this Trojan work for the people of Meath East and beyond, and will always work honourably and with that same sincerity.  Shane's genuine compassion, combined with his interest in and concern for people and their lives allowed him to excel in his role as a public representative.  He was both admired and respected, but above all else was trusted.<\/p><p><br \/>  The decision to move the writ today fulfils the Government's standing commitment not to leave seats in this House vacant for periods of longer than six months.  We can all agree that Shane McEntee's absence is still deeply felt in the House, both in his Fine Gael family and outside it.  However, he left a rare and wonderful legacy.  The forthcoming by-election will give the people of Meath East the opportunity to select someone to continue the work started by Shane McEntee and to build on his great legacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500033#FF00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1362505800,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I begin by paying tribute to the late Shane McEntee, who served the constituency of Meath East with great commitment and loyalty.

As a democrat and believer in free speech, I believe that robust and open debate is not only part of politics, but is an essential prerequisite for it.  However, the sad circumstances that have given rise to this by-election place an onus on each of us in this House and outside it to conduct that debate in a way that is respectful, fair and decent.

The neglect of rapidly developing areas, together with the challenges of a disproportionately young population were prominent.  The lack of affordable and available child care, time spent by people commuting to and from work and the lack of infrastructure and support services for new communities all dominated.

People are afforded a lot more freedom in a by-election.  It is often much more difficult to call a result because of the emotional content.  For example, the sad and untimely death of Shane McEntee may play a part in this by-election.  It goes without saying that nobody in this House welcomes a by-election in these circumstances.  The 2005 by-elections were in respect of replacement of former Deputies Charlie McCreevy and John Bruton.  We are in different times now, experiencing different emotions.  It is certain different emotions will come to the fore on this occasion.  For example, issues such as the stress being experienced by individuals and families owing to job losses and sufficient incomes to pay mortgages and other bills will undoubtedly feature and prompt a response in the polls.<\/p><p>  Commuter belt areas tend to be poorer in terms of service delivery.  For example, Meath boasts one of the poorest ratios of Garda per head of population, with Kildare having the lowest ratio in this regard.<\/p><p>The local government staff level is the lowest nationally, which produces a lower and weaker level of service.  Front-line services delivered by the HSE are often disproportionately worse.  It is difficult to see how the Croke Park agreement will not influence those who deliver the services and those who struggle to acquire them.  These services will be part of the by-election agenda.  There is also an irony about today, when debate has been limited and a guillotine is being placed on the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill to allow the Revenue Commissioners deliver yet another financial burden on households in Meath East and elsewhere.  These bills are likely to drop through the letterbox together with election material from the various candidates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500034#GG03300","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362507000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>They will hold them back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500035#HH00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1362507000,"counter":470,"content":"<p>It is hard to see how this will not feature as a major issue, particularly in households which are up to their tonsils in debt and, because of recent large-scale development in Meath East, may have forked out huge sums in stamp duty which will not form part of the expected exemptions.  The by-election will be seen as an opportunity to make a statement on the performance of the Government, as by-elections always are.  This by-election will be about a clash of emotions, between the undoubted fondness and respect for the McEntee family on one side, and on the other, the anger, regret and hopelessness felt by so many about the direction the Government has taken.  I wish all candidates well, but at the end of the day the people of Meath East are sovereign and they will decide on the replacement for Shane McEntee in the

I am sure the Minister is aware of the concerns expressed locally in a march last Saturday and in communications we have had in recent months.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and local angling groups have made presentations to local authorities in Galway and have met a number of Oireachtas Members including me.  Their concerns are numerous and include the effect sea lice would have on native salmon and trout smolts in the Spiddal, Cashla, Costello, Kilcolgan, Clarinbridge and Corrib river systems.  There are also concerns regarding fish escaping from such a large salmon farm which will have more than 7 million salmon at its peak, and regarding pollution and the impact on local angling.  Connemara and Galway are renowned for their angling, with Lough Corrib being the largest lake in the Republic, and it is a hugely important industry for us.<\/p><p>  I mo thuairim, t&aacute; ceisteanna f&oacute;s le freagairt maidir leis an bhfeirm &eacute;isc seo.

These concerns are based on scientific reports by respected authors and knowledge of the impact of existing fish farms on salmon and sea trout populations off the west coast of Ireland.  Sea lice would have devastating effects on wild salmon, as they account for up to 39% of salmon mortalities according to recent peer-reviewed international scientific literature.  Concerns have also been expressed about the associated loss of jobs in the recreational angling and tourism sector if the development proceeds without adequate environmental protections being in place.<\/p><p>  I call on the Minister to publish the responses from BIM to his Department with regard to the queries and concerns of local groups about the environmental impact statement.  We need transparency in all issues and in this case it would allay fears and concerns and allow local groups, anglers, individuals and Inland Fisheries Ireland know exactly what BIM is applying to do before any decision is made.  I appreciate the Minister and the Department will ultimately have to make the decision.  I understand they will receive advice or a lead opinion from the Irish Marine Institute but it is important the responses to the scientific facts are known and presented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500035#HH02700","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1362507000,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I see aquaculture as a crucial component of the Government's Food Harvest 2020 strategy.

Last year, we received an allocation of &euro;867,000 from the Department, but this year it has been cut by 76% to &euro;208,000.  The council provides its own 20% matching funds. <\/p><p>  These housing adaption grants are for people with disabilities to help install access ramps, stair-lifts, downstair toilet facilities and showers.  The scheme for housing aid for older people is to help those in poor housing conditions to make the necessary repairs so they can stay in their own homes.  The mobility aids housing grant scheme is to allow people to get urgent works carried out, including grab-rails, access ramps, level access showers and stair-lifts.  All of these grants have been cut dramatically.<\/p><p>  It is noteworthy that the letters went out last Friday to local authorities and there was no public announcement.  The letters were issued within 48 hours of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, announcing the axing of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grants.  Two days after that announcement, the Minister chose not to issue a public statement on her decision to cut these grants by 40% on average.  She merely issued a letter to local authorities.  As I understand it, the figures are not even available across the country.  Each local authority has its own information.  At the first opportunity, the Minister should consider a supplementary Estimate for Laois in view of the excessive cut to grants in that county. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500036#JJ00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1362507600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I want to add my voice to this matter.

Westmeath County Council will experience a grant cut of more than 46% from &euro;988,155 to &euro;435,722 this year.  Longford County Council is facing a cut of 42% and this is despite both county councils, whose members I compliment, in their wisdom putting by their allocation from limited resources to ensure they could get the maximum possible allocation from the Department to ensure that older people and people with disabilities would be allowed to live out the rest of their lives in independence and with a sense of dignity.  These grants are used to install stairlifts, access ramps and level access showers.  They are used to replace windows and doors and to rewire houses.  This is not about putting people into the lap of luxury but is simply about ensuring that elderly people and people with a disability can live in dignity.<\/p><p> The Minister of State will be obliged to revisit this issue.  It is a callous cut and while I do not doubt the Minister of State is a genuine person who wishes to ensure that value for money is achieved, she must revisit this issue because, with their limited resources, the councils have allocated enough money to enable work to be done.

As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I am keenly aware of the challenges the Government faces in delivering housing supports to a range of vulnerable households and groups.  The difficulties facing the State's finances and the necessity to reduce public expenditure to sustainable levels are having an impact on capital programmes all across the public service and my Department's housing programme is no exception.  Members will be aware and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies in particular should be aware of the reason for such reduced allocations.  However, the amount of capital funding available has decreased significantly in recent years along the lines highlighted in the medium-term Exchequer framework for infrastructure and capital investment from 2012 to 2016.  Regrettably, these steps are necessary to bring stability to the public finances and, as a result, capital spending on housing programmes in 2013 will be lower than last year.  I could spend time explaining the reason for this but certainly, the previous Government has a great deal more responsibility for it than has any action taken by the current Administration.  Unfortunately, one is faced with a situation in which capital budgets right across the board have been cut.<\/p><p>  That said, I am determined to make the best use of this limited budget and to target those who are most in need.  To this end, the social housing supply initiatives are now nearly completely focused on meeting the housing needs of elderly people, people with a disability and the homeless.  Approximately &euro;120 million is being dedicated to this important programme in 2013.  Reduced capital budgets inevitably give rise to difficult choices and decisions in allocating the available funding.  In the case of new social housing supply, there are alternative supply routes through the leasing of properties to augment the smaller numbers coming from the traditional capital funded construction programmes.  Last year, more than 6,000 additional social housing units were provided, taking all supply routes into account, and I am confident that a further 5,000 units will be provided this year.  These difficult choices mean balancing a dwindling capital budget across a range of important areas and spreading those scarce resources in a way that meets the needs of those concerned as best one can.  The capital budget must cover regeneration, improvements and energy retrofitting of the social housing stock, as well as adaptation grants for private housing.<\/p><p>  I also am conscious that substantial grant funding was provided for improving and adapting private houses in recent years.  In the past two years, almost 22,000 householders benefited under the schemes.  This year, I am allocating 12.4% of the housing budget or approximately &euro;34.2 million to the grant schemes, compared with 13.2% in 2012.  In allocating the available funding across all 34 city and county councils, I have done so in as transparent and as fair a way as possible.  Between them, local authorities currently have contractual commitments from last year in respect of approved grants totalling &euro;18 million.  Local authorities were always encouraged to maintain continuity with regard to approving and paying grants and commitments carried forward into the new financial year always had first call on the available funding.  This year, each authority was allocated the full amount of their contractual commitments.  The balance of the available funding was allocated on the basis of each authority's share of the new applications on hand in January 2013.  I believe this to be a fair and equitable way of apportioning the funding.  However, I appreciate this approach has resulted in lower than expected allocations for some authorities.  Deputy Fleming should be aware that, regrettably, only Laois County Council reported a zero commitment in respect of contractual commitments on approved works, which has had a major effect on the allocation to Laois in particular.  I accept that particular difficulties may arise in some local authorities in the course of 2013 but have a contingency in place to deal with this.  I have set aside a capital reserve of approximately &euro;2 million and will consider applications from local authorities for a supplementary allocation once the initial allocation has been exhausted.  I hope this gives Deputies some light at the end of the tunnel but it genuinely was a fair way in which to allocate the money, that is, first to the commitments that already existed and then on the basis of the applications that came in from the various counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500037#KK00500","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1362508200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>The Minister of State may assist in respect of transparency by publishing the list that went to each local authority, as Members have not had sight of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500037#KK00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1362508200,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I will revert to the Deputy in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500037#KK00700","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1362508200,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Second, the reason Laois County Council had zero commitments was it did not enter into commitments when it did not know it was guaranteed funding.  It is being penalised for being prudent whereas in respect of the other counties, the Minister of State has indicated that &euro;18 million of commitments were entered into without a guarantee of funding and consequently, they have access to the first tranche.  In other words, the responsible local authority that was clearing its waiting lists and not entering into commitments has been unfairly penalised.  I spoke today to the Minister of State's departmental officials in Ballina, who genuinely were very helpful, and a letter was sent today by Laois County Council seeking some additional funds from the capital reserve.  The Minister of State will understand the point that because Laois County Council was highly organised in its business, it did not have commitments it could not meet and the council should not be penalised for that.  During the course of the year, the Minister of State should make good a significant amount from that reserve.<\/p><p>  My final point is I do not accept the premise of the Minister of State's comments on scarce capital resources within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.

I am also engaged in attempting to ascertain whether some kind of stimulus proposal can be put in place this year that would employ some of those people to whom Deputy Troy referred.  Perhaps it would not necessarily be in this particular scheme but, for example, local authority houses could be retrofitted more extensively than is the case at present, which also would ease the burden of the payment of fuel bills for people in some of the older local authority houses.

It is very important that the Minister is here to listen and hopefully I can impress upon her to do whatever is necessary to avoid cuts to some of the projects listed.  They are not all within my constituency but I will concentrate on the projects that I know best.<\/p><p>  These projects in the main are in working class or disadvantaged areas, whichever title the Minister wants to use, but they tick all the boxes that always define areas of major need, where the drug problem has been at its height.  In the past there was low educational attainment in these areas.  Much has been done about that in recent years and the cycle has been broken but if we continue with the cuts in youth services the cycle might be created again.  Many are areas of very violent crime but they are also areas of severe poverty.  They are impoverished in many ways.  Whereas in richer or more affluent areas in Dublin there might be a call on the community to fund or help part-fund some of the projects that is not an option in most of these areas.  The groups with which I have worked are imaginative in their fund-raising.  They have tried everything, they have examined every grant available not only in Ireland but around the world.  They have appealed to philanthropists.  They have considered alternate sources of funds.  They have pared all of their overheads right down to the bone because this is not the first cut.  It comes after a series of cuts.<\/p><p>  In many cases they have pared back their services, wages, and administration costs.  It is not as if they are not aware of the need to be prudent in this day and age.  They have done that in buckets yet they were told before Christmas to expect a cut of maybe 3%, 4% or even 5%.  The cuts are huge for some of the projects listed by the City of Dublin Youth Services Board because they have already pared down.  I will not deal with two groups, Focus Ireland and Candle which are substantial, and there are major reasons for that.  I have some problems with them because alternative funding is already in place to capture that.  Maybe the Minister is considering those organisations.  Groups such as The Base in Ballyfermot have been pared down.  The size of the funding looks attractive but it has been cut by 14% which would not sound huge if we were in an era of plenty but a cut of &euro;60,000 from the budget of an organisation dealing with the most disadvantaged children in Dublin 10 is huge.  That means job losses, curtailment of services, closure on certain days.  The same could be said of the Ballyfermot youth services.  Deputy Conaghan, who is here, would know some of the groups I am listing and the effects of such a cut on the Ballyfermot Youth Services or The Base.  It is suggested that &euro;73,000 will come out of its budget which is substantial.<\/p><p>  I know that the final decision does not necessarily lie with the Minister but she can sign off or refuse to sign off on what the City of Dublin Youth Services Board presents to her.  I urge her not to sign off on cuts of that scale and to look again to ensure that services do not end up reducing their service or their hours, especially at this time for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500038#LL00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1362508800,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue of support for youth services and I know the services to which he refers.  I have been to The Base in Ballyfermot and I know the work of the Ballyfermot Youth Services and I want to support as much as I possibly can the work done by youth services in Dublin and throughout the country.  I recognise its value and would like to be investing more in it if that was feasible.<\/p><p>  In 2013 my Department will provide funding of &euro;53.173 million to support the provision of youth services and programmes throughout the country, including in particular, as the Deputy rightly says, in disadvantaged communities.  That funding supports national and local youth work.  There are approximately 1,400 paid staff, 40,000 volunteers and 400,000 young people participating in youth services and activities.  We need to give more exposure to the work and make sure that youth work is recognised for the continuum of services it gives to young people.  It has a huge role to play which I will focus on during my EU presidency of the Youth Council to help young people participate in training and eventually employment as well.  That aspect of youth work increasingly needs attention.<\/p><p>  As in all areas of the public sector, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has had to find savings as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE.  We must play our part as part of the collective Government effort to reduce our unsustainable day-to-day deficit.  That is the reality for my Department as well as others.  The CRE, published in December 2011, set out clearly the savings required for my Department in each of the years, 2012 to 2014.  I published that, along with the detail of what would happen to all of this funding over that three year period.  That was known to everybody involved.  When we published the review we had a seven page chapter outlining the savings we required from the youth work funding schemes and it came to close to 10%.  The bodies who administer these grants on behalf of the Department were notified about this and would have been familiar with what was in the CRE for the three year period in question.  In the course of the past few weeks and months I have met with representatives of the youth sector with a view to determining how best to minimise the impact of the reduction in the 2013 budget on youth services, given the challenging budgetary situation we face.  The administering bodies have been asked to examine issues such as salary levels, conditions, administrative costs across projects and services, if these have not already been addressed.<\/p><p>  As far as possible I want to protect the front line services that youth workers and services provide to very vulnerable young people.  In order to try to maximise the use of the funding available for youth services and programmes I have given flexibility to the local bodies which administer the grants, normally the VECs, to propose the reconfiguration of the allocations provided, having regard to the knowledge available to these bodies about the needs of young people at local level.  There is flexibility built in to the bodies which administer the schemes to examine each project and come back to me with recommendations.  As the Deputy says it comes back to me in the end.<\/p><p>  In that context last week the City of Dublin Youth Service Board, as the local grant administering body in the Dublin area, submitted a proposal to the Department requesting that percentage reductions, different from those outlined in the CRE, would be applied to projects in the Dublin area.  Their rationale, as they said to me, was to minimise the disruption to services and they said they had examined each of the projects and made recommendations based on the examination of those projects.  In their analysis the majority of projects would receive cuts of less than 10%, many would be cut for example by 2%.  They paid particular attention to the smaller projects and wanted to ensure they would continue because they felt they were providing a valuable service.  They also said that some of the larger projects would receive greater reductions, hence the projects the Deputy mentioned which are receiving larger funding.  I appreciate that they have made huge efforts to manage within that funding.  That is the recommendation that has come to me.<\/p><p>  I am examining the proposals from the City of Dublin Youth Service Board.  My Department officials met last Friday with the board and we are examining the proposals that have been submitted.<\/p><p>There is no cut at present for the local voluntary youth clubs.  Some other funding has been made available for the support of youth work this year.  I am examining the proposals and the approach of the board and I will make a decision shortly.  I take on board the points made about the value of the services being provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500038#LL00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362509400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I hope I have impressed upon the Minister the need not to proceed with these developments.

The same applies to Brad&oacute;g in the north inner city, which faces a cost of 14%, and Sphere 17 in Darndale, which faces a cut of &euro;122,000.  For any organisation, that would be a huge cut and means fewer jobs and services.  The cumulative effect in my constituency amounts to almost &euro;500,000, not including the Focus Ireland cut.  It is substantial in respect of youth services in one constituency.  This is taking place on top of cuts to child benefit, maternity benefit, DEIS schools and special needs assistants and tax increases.  In the past, money might have been found by appealing to parents to contribute an extra donation but they cannot do so now.

The problem has been intensifying over the past year and is getting worse.  It affects elderly people, who are not fit to be left lying on trolleys.<\/p><p>  This is of grave concern to the Minister for Health.  I compliment him on his nationwide campaign to eliminate the problem and his initiative in setting up and funding the special delivery unit to tackle the problem of people on trolleys.  The state of affairs at Mayo General Hospital is even more disturbing given that the hospital got on top of the trolley problem in 2011 with a 64% reduction in the number of people on trolleys.  This is a considerably greater achievement than the national average, a reduction of 20%.  There is evidence that the management knows its stuff and has a track record of thinking outside the box to tackle the issue.  This is exactly the challenge the Minister has laid down.<\/p><p>  However the problems and blockages at Mayo General Hospital are caused by external factors and the problems are twofold.  There was a significant increase of 8% in people presenting at the accident and emergency unit in 2012, together with an 8% increase in the number of medical patients being treated in the hospital.  One of the reasons for this is that 5% of patients are from Roscommon.  This is a knock-on effect of the closure of the accident and emergency unit at Roscommon hospital, which leads to an increase in the number of people presenting from Roscommon.  Anecdotally, it seems that changes to the way GPs are paid means they are doing fewer house calls.  Consequently, more people are being referred to accident and emergency units.  There is an increased dependence on the public health system, with fewer people able to afford private health care.<\/p><p>  The greatest problem causing overcrowding at Mayo General Hospital is delayed discharge, which is a major problem in the hospital.  This week, the average delayed discharge daily figure is 16 patients.  Last week it was 12.  Over the previous weeks a similar pattern has emerged.  These patients are passing their time in an acute hospital bed and should be transferred into stepdown facilities.  The problem is a lack of stepdown facilities available in the county.<\/p><p>  A startling statistic is that following the closure of 12 stepdown beds in Ballina District Hospital since the end of 2011, the number of delayed discharges at Mayo General Hospital has increased by 400%.  The blockage at Mayo General Hospital is chronic and needs urgent intervention, which is what I seek.  I acknowledge the &euro;105,000 allocated from the special delivery unit this year and the &euro;300,000 last year to support the acute medical assessment unit.  These moneys were spent to good effect.<\/p><p>  The money allocated for this year is insufficient to address the problem.  We need more stepdown facilities.  I request that the HSE is directed and funded to open 12 beds in Ballina District Hospital.  It makes economic sense.  A patient in a medical bed in Mayo General Hospital costs the State &euro;900 per day, compared to &euro;1,000 per week at Ballina District Hospital.  Stepdown beds at Swinford and Belmullet district hospitals could also be part of the solution.  It is imperative funding is made available for two intermediate care teams in County Mayo.  This will allow patients, where appropriate, to receive hospital-style treatment in their homes.  In many cases, it would prevent these people being admitted to hospital in the first place and allow for early discharge.  I seek funding and urgent intervention.  Management has a proven ability to tackle the trolley issue but external factors are having an impact and the hospital needs the support of the Minister and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500039#MM00500","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1362509400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Government is committed to ensuring that patients receive the highest standards of care in the appropriate settings, be they acute, community, primary or residential.  The traditional focus on the institution rather than the patient must be changed.  To this end, we support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible.  This is realised through a range of community-based services such as mainstream home help, enhanced home care packages, or via other supports such as meals-on-wheels and respite or day care.  The services are designed to be as flexible as possible to best meet the needs of individual recipients, their families and their carers.<\/p><p>  In order to meet increasing population needs and to deliver sustainable services within available resources, innovative models of care are required to further advance the development of equitable integrated care for older people across community-based services, intermediate care options and quality long-term residential care services supported by a robust and well-funded scheme.  The provision of intermediate care options and the provision of clear pathways of care for older persons accessing the health care systems will continue to be developed in 2013, with specific emphasis on the provision of transitional intermediate type care to address the issue of unnecessary admissions to acute hospitals and the requirements for long-term care.  This will build on the work commenced in 2012, which saw an investment of &euro;11 million in these types of services.<\/p><p>  The HSE service plan 2013 was published on 10 January 2013 and the HSE west service plan was published on 28 February.  Budgets have now been allocated for each local area within HSE west.  New developments for 2013 are identified across a number of services, including funding of &euro;35 million nationally for mental health, &euro;620 million for primary care and &euro;90 million demographic funding to include services such as screening, expansion of the ambulance service and a specific &euro;10 million for pressures arising in hospitals.<\/p><p>Decisions will be taken shortly on prioritising need for this funding.  They will be taken on the basis of current productivity and performance in managing existing resources.  The needs and issues highlighted by the acute services in Mayo to which the Deputy referred will be taken into consideration in the process of allocating the funding.<\/p><p> I am happy to note the Deputy's acknowledgement that the provision of care in other settings could facilitate the better use of acute hospital resources.

The way that the House has been treated in terms of this Bill and the legislation that it amends, which the House passed before Christmas, is a disgrace.  Many genuine issues need to be teased out in some detail.  For example, we will spend the next three days debating the Finance Bill in committee in a measured, considered and professional way.  Why can we not apply the same level of responsible parliamentary behaviour in dealing with this Bill, which affects every household?<\/p><p>  The Minister has shown no willingness to date to consider any of our amendments.  I hope that he will prove me wrong.  It is 7.05 p.m., this debate will adjourn at 7.30 p.m., it will resume at 9 p.m. and conclude at 10.30 p.m.  We have less than two hours to debate 67 Opposition amendments to one of the most important Bills that the House will consider in this term.<\/p><p>  Key issues that I will raise during the course of the couple of hours available to us are those of ability to pay and fairness.  Adequate consideration has not been given to the needs of people who are struggling with mortgage arrears or are trapped in negative equity, who have paid high levels of stamp duty or development contributions to local authorities in recent years or who, through no fault of their own, are in low-income households.  The thresholds that have been set are inadequate, even for deferrals.<\/p><p>  Clearly, the Minister is not for turning on the overall principle of introducing a property tax.  Be that as it may, all sides of the House have an obligation to seek to improve the measures that the Minister is introducing.  I do not doubt that, having read through all of the amendments tabled by a variety of Deputies, some would make the property tax fairer if implemented.  They would introduce in a meaningful way an assessment of a person's ability to pay and take into account the person's other obligations and commitments.<\/p><p>  This is all that I will say at the outset.  We have limited time.  I want this to be a meaningful debate in which we deal with the amendments tabled.

The reality is that the property tax has not a shred of democratic legitimacy.  Fine Gael, the majority party in government, categorically ruled out a property tax in its 2011 election manifesto when it claimed that \"a recurring residential property tax on the family home is unfair\".  The Labour Party also ruled out the property tax as now to be implemented.  Therefore, we have a blatant perversion of truthfulness by the two Government parties in front of the ordinary people of this State in coming here and doing an about-face in implementing this savage austerity tax, which will quickly grow to &euro;1,000 per annum when combined with the water tax.<\/p><p>  Next week, the Revenue Commissioners, who have been given responsibility by the Government to implement this odious tax, will send nearly 2 million letters to houses.  There should be a wholesale rejection by the majority of householders or everyone out there of any demand by Revenue to make returns or give any information whatsoever.  There should be a mass boycott of all aspects of this illegitimate tax being undemocratically foisted on the people.  A massive movement of people power and worker power is needed to overturn this major attack on living standards and on people of middle and low incomes on behalf of the bailout agenda of the European financial institutions and on the diktats of the troika.<\/p><p>  If 1 million households or more organised, refused to co-operate, boycotted the tax and brought their considerable opposition to the parties in government in a campaign of political public pressure, they could break the tax.  It should be overturned.  As an illegitimate law, it is legitimate for people to defy it through mass people power and worker power between now and the demand for the returns at the end of May.  If the Government dares to deduct a single cent from social welfare payments or workers' wages, opposition should be carried through with industrial action in workplaces.  This is the only legitimate response to a tax that has no democratic credibility and provides for a significant and unsupportable attack on the living standards and incomes of the poor, the unemployed and low and middle-income workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500040#NN00800","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speech","time":1362510000,"counter":533,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy is next.

Some of us went to the trouble of framing amendments in good faith, but there is no good faith in dealing with them.  Even the Title of the Bill belies its intent, as there is nothing local about the tax.  It is not raised locally, the money spent will only replace the money withdrawn from the local government fund and no additional services will be provided to people.<\/p><p>It is radically different from what happens in other countries in that local property taxes are raised locally.  People know what they are paying for, which is a world away from what is being proposed in this case.<\/p><p> Issues are going to jump up and bite us, so to speak, because they have not been properly considered.  People have made modifications to their homes to accommodate disabled persons - with or without a local authority grant.  In some cases people had to wait so long for a grant that a local community has fund-raised to allow the modification to be made.  Such a family will not qualify on the grounds that it did not get a grant simply because it would have had to wait for too long.  There is a world of difference in terms of how local authorities administer the grant process.  That requires scrutiny for a particularly vulnerable cohort.<\/p><p> There are major difficulties with what has been proposed on pyrite-affected homes.  A household might have to expend three times the amount required in property tax just to have the house tested to prove pyrite levels are sufficiently high to require exemption.  Leaving aside the principle of a property tax, we have identified a number of issues that will be problematic in terms of the fair application of the tax.  Not having sufficient time to debate the issues will result in future problems.  We cannot ignore the fact that according to the credit union movement, 1.8 million households have only approximately &euro;100 of disposable income per month on which to live.  A significant cohort will simply not be able to pay the tax.  It is wrong to allow interest to build on deferred payments.  I will leave it at that.

Much has been said previously about this evening&rsquo;s business.  This is the second piece of legislation on the property tax and the Minister has done exactly the same thing with it as was done with the previous legislation.  I accept that the lead spokesperson had time to debate the issue on Second Stage but we want to get into the nitty-gritty of the Bill on Committee Stage.  We are dealing with section 1, which relates to the Title because we are aware that we will not get to the amendments we have tabled that cover many of the other sections.<\/p><p>  The Minister is aware of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position on the tax.  We are completely opposed to it.  We make no bones about it.  We do not say it is the wrong time or the wrong tax; it is simply our position that a family home tax should not be imposed on the people of this State.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to having the tax repealed.  We believe the only way for people to avoid paying the tax is to repeal it.  I will continue to try to enlist support for such a measure both inside and outside this Chamber so that there is a popular demand for it and that in future we will have a Government that will repeal this legislation which will have such a drastic effect on people across the State.<\/p><p>  A property tax will affect people&rsquo;s disposable income, well-being and in some cases, mental health.  I received a phone call to my office from someone in mortgage distress.  A property tax goes to the nub in terms of mortgage distress because there is nothing in the Bill that will bring any alleviation to the 180,000 people who are suffering through mortgage distress and who face various types of turmoil.  A member of my office staff told me about a phone call she received where the husband recounted to her that his wife is crying all the time because they cannot get out of the turmoil they are in due to mortgage distress.  They are preoccupied with the thought of losing their home or of not being able to pay their bills and all of the pressure that brings to bear on people.  He told the member of staff who took the call that one night he went upstairs and gathered whatever coins he could find together and gave his wife the money to get something for herself.<\/p><p>  We previously discussed mental health issues, people taking their own lives and the effects various decisions have on society.  There is no doubt the Minister will not bat an eyelid when he gets his letter from the Revenue.  Neither will the Taoiseach.  How could they on the salaries they receive?  It is just another cheque that has to be written and another letter to be posted to the Revenue.  It means nothing to them.  It will not put them up or down.  However, for the vast majority of people the tax is a big consideration they will face in the coming days and weeks.  There is no doubt that from Monday on, when the postman starts to deliver the letters from the Revenue, houses across the State will dread the rattle of the letterbox heralding another bill on the family.  Such families have probably been sitting around the table doing the sums on how they can afford this or that, which bill they will prioritise and which one they will ignore and, hopefully, catch up on later.  The letter will be accompanied with the harshness of the Revenue&rsquo;s stamp.  If a person is not in a position to pay the tax and they cannot get a deferral, then the big boys in government will come after them.  They will come after them through their social welfare payment, if they are unemployed and lucky enough to be in receipt of a social welfare payment.  They will come after them if they are a farmer depending on REPS payment or area aid so that the income they were expecting to get to ensure stock are fed during the bad winter will be reduced.  Worse again, Revenue will dip into their bank account and the money they thought was there to pay for their mortgage or certain bills will be taken by the State because, come hell or high water, the Government will get its pound of flesh.<\/p><p>  This is an unfair and unjust tax.  There are different ways to bring in revenue.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  In the context of bringing in additional taxation, every option will affect someone and it will hurt some people more than others.  I deplore the approach being taken that every single person who has a roof over his or her head must pay a tax.  The tax is not based on the value of one&rsquo;s home because for many, it is a charge on a liability.  It is a charge on debt.  The Minister is aware that people are swimming in a pool of debt.  They are drowning in a sea of debt.  The Minister knows the figures as well as I do.  Properties have lost 55% of their value in recent years.  Just this week an auction in Dublin included a property in Donegal.  I do not know the owner but I am sure the mortgage on the property was more than &euro;25,000, which was the reserve price for the apartment in Letterkenny.  The apartment did not even sell.  People are suffering under massive debt and the property tax will add to the burden.<\/p><p>  I feel like I am talking to a brick wall.  I genuinely cannot get over how quickly the Government lost touch.  Fianna F&aacute;il lost touch gradually and the situation probably accelerated in the boom years when it lost complete control.  The Government is in office two years.  It is two years ago since the Government entered this Chamber to hang out its brightest colours.  Two years later its brightest colours are coming in the form of envelopes that will be posted by the Revenue through hundreds of thousands of doors that will bring nothing but misery, hardship, pain and more suffering to individuals from whom the Government promised to lift the burden and deal with the terrible situation it inherited.<\/p><p>  The legislation is flawed.  In my Second Stage speech I mentioned that some aspects of the Bill are positive and others are negative.<\/p><p>Even the types of exemptions that the Minister is trying to trumpet as a huge success are far from it.  Take the pyrite exemption, for example.  Homes affected by pyrite will be exempt, but who is kidding who?  If one looks at the section of the original Bill dealing with the chargeable value of a house, the legislation says that it amounts to what one is deemed to be able to get as a fair market value if one was to sell one's house on the liability date.  If I own a house affected by pyrite, does the Minister think I will get anything for it?  It will not be sold because there is no value in it.  An apartment in Letterkenny which is not affected by pyrite would not be sold for &euro;25,000.  A house affected by pyrite has no value at this point in time.  Therefore, giving an exemption to a house affected by pyrite makes absolutely no sense because 2%, 10%, 50% or even 90% of the value of a house affected by pyrite is still zero.  It will not sell in the market today so giving it an exemption is meaningless.  It is an attempt by the Government to dress this up and pretend it is tackling the issue of the tens of thousands of homes that are affected by pyrite.<\/p><p> Another issue of concern arises with regard to the section dealing with homes adapted for persons with disabilities.  We will not even reach that section of the Bill but it is an area about which I am genuinely passionate, on the basis of my own family experience with a late uncle of mine.  His family had to adapt their house many years ago, which cost a lot of money, and the community responded to their need.  I have been in many homes where adaptions were necessary.  The section of the Bill dealing with such homes contains a fig leaf which will addresses the concerns of some people but not others because it is based on a grant having been availed of that was means tested and which covered a portion of the value of the work carried out at the time.  It is mean and cruel.<\/p><p> I will cite one particular situation and I am sure the person concerned will not mind me mentioning it.  A fisherman from one of the islands off the coast of Donegal had a terrible accident.  When I started out in politics, we had a fund-raising campaign to help pay for an adaption to his house.  I know him and have visited him a number of times over the years.  His house has been adapted and he lies there, paralysed.  His mother looks after him all of the time and has suffered as a result of cuts inflicted by this and the previous Governments.  That adaption had to be made.  It was not done because the mother wanted another room and an extra bathroom.  It was done because her son had to be cared for, and had the adaption not been made, he would have had to be put into long-term residential care.  Yet the Minister, with this legislation, still will not address that family's concerns because it is based on the family's income at the time.  Furthermore, if they did not apply for a grant at the time, they do not get an exemption from the property tax.  These are issues that we will not even get to touch on this evening, although I appreciate being allowed to mention them now.  It is really annoying that, despite our complete and utter opposition to this legislation, and despite the fact that we have tabled amendments which are sensible and which, if the Minister had time to discuss and thrash them out, he might have a second look at, that is not going to be facilitated because the Minister and his Cabinet and Government colleagues have voted to quash debate on this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500041#OO00200","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362511200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I will be brief seeing as we have very little time.  I must say there is a sickening feeling of <i>d&eacute;j&Agrave; vu<\/i> about this session.  It is a carbon copy of the charade that went on here before Christmas, where the Minister sat, nodding off while this side of the House was allowed vent its spleen a bit, nobody was present from the Government benches and then they came in like sheep later on to foist the original Bill on us.  Here we are again only a matter of weeks later.  It is galling to have been here on Friday and to have seen a line of backbenchers, particularly from Fine Gael, shedding crocodile tears about houses in Dublin, houses with pyrite and people on low incomes.  These are the very issues around which we have tabled amendments tonight but which we are not going to get a chance to discuss in any meaningful way.  This spectacle makes an absolute mockery of the legislative process.  I am not actually interested in playing the game in here because the reality is that this battle or game will be sorted out outside this House.  People will not put up with the waffle and rubbish that is coming out of this place because they simply cannot afford to pay what is being put on their shoulders.  However, I do want the opportunity to expose Government backbenchers tonight who made false promises on the issue of pyrite, who shed crocodile tears for people on low incomes but who passed legislation that is more draconian than anything else on our Statute Book to allow the Government to put its paws into the pockets of low-paid workers.<\/p><p><br \/>  Obviously, the Bill before us tonight is designed to take some of the sting out of the original proposition but it fails miserably in this regard precisely because it makes no reference whatsoever to ability to pay.  The Minister's party fought the election with a manifesto which told voters that it would not bring in a home tax because people who own homes can be asset rich but cash poor or they can be young people struggling with negative equity.  The Minister has rewarded all of those people for their votes by imposing the opposite of what his party said it would do.  We have tabled amendments tonight to take account of those people and to exclude them from the net.<\/p><p><br \/>  Obviously, we do not agree with a home tax at all.  It is patently unfair, particularly when the Minister had many other avenues for raising money.  He could have increased corporation tax just a tad.  He could have slightly increased income tax on the high earners and he would have got just as much, if not more, as he will from imposing this further austerity on ordinary people.  The Government chose not to do that.  I want the Minister's backbenchers to have the choice to vote on our amendments tonight.  I would like to know, before this session breaks, where the amendments stand.  We do not know, at this stage, which of our amendments are being allowed and which are being ruled out of order.  The least the Minister can do is give us the respect of allowing us to know that before we come back after Private Members' business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500042#PP00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1362511200,"counter":539,"content":"<p>This Government should be utterly ashamed of itself for what it is doing and the way in which it is trampling on the democratic process.

The Bill is not fair nor progressive.  It is cruelly unfair and seems designed to be so.

Critically, the sustainability of the private health insurance market is also at risk, which is a clear difficulty for the Government.  In many respects, it is a difficulty of its own making.<\/p><p><br \/>  Inflation costs in private health insurance are many multiple of the broader consumer price index inflation and health sector inflation.  Health insurance premia have gone through the roof in the past number of years, and as a result it is critical that the Minister takes a hard look at policies and the legislative framework base in underpinning a move to universal health insurance.  We have spoken about the issue on numerous occasions and the Government does not seem to understand the difficulties out there, with families dropping out of health insurance plans, as outlined by the Health Insurance Authority.  Over 70,000 people left health insurance in 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  When 34,000 people left health insurance two years ago, the Minister described it as a crisis and was apoplectic with rage, frothing from the back teeth on a continuous basis about the need for strategic policies around the issue of private health insurance.  Nothing has happened since except the opposite to what was required.  The Minister of State is aware that there should have been non-advanced plans but none exist.  All the people paying for lower benefit health insurance schemes will now subsidise those on more expensive plans.  That was outlined at a health committee meeting some weeks ago by health insurers.  The people who can only afford basic plans and cover will now subsidise those people with the Rolls-Royce of private health insurance, which is clearly unjust and unfair.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government must rethink the issue very quickly.  When the Minister dealt with Second Stage of the risk equalisation Bill last year, he indicated non-advanced plans could be available and exempt from the higher levy.  We were led to believe by the Health Insurance Authority that there would be approximately 47 non-advanced plans.  The legislation has been passed but there are no non-advanced plans, which means we are asking people hanging on by their fingertips to private health insurance and are dropping benefits.  That means they can no longer avail of day case procedures or MRI scans or will have to pay for them.  Health insurers have indicated that benefits must be removed from plans to ensure they qualify for the non-advanced category.<\/p><p><br \/>  We are asking people to choose whether to fill a tank with heating oil, pay a gas bill or pay for insurance.  These people must now subsidise a person with a &#8364;4,000 premium plan and who is staying in five star accommodation.  That is clearly unjust and the Government must examine it.  If the Government does not understand the advice it gets from the authority and officials, it will be at clear odds with the facts in the market.  The four insurers have indicated clearly that this will be a result of the risk equalisation levy and the lack of non-advanced plans available to the many families struggling on a daily basis.<\/p><p><br \/>  Every party and Government over the years has encouraged people to take out health insurance.  There was tax allowance for the VHI for many years and such incentives still exist.  There has been a policy of encouraging people to take out private health insurance.  We are saying to those who have been paying for private insurance for generations - since the foundation of the VHI - that because of the legislation to redesignate beds in public hospitals, if a person is referred through an accident and emergency department to any public hospital in the country, health insurance customers will foot the bill to be treated in a public hospital.  These people would have already funded the hospital through general taxation but they would receive no extra benefits.  It is completely unacceptable to ask a person who has worked and made sacrifices in paying health insurance and contributing to the Exchequer - which funds public hospitals - to accept an indirect charge when they are in an accident and emergency department and a private health insurance card is found in their pocket.  As health insurance companies will foot the bill, the expense will be passed to private health insurance customers, which is an unacceptably low practice in funding the country's health services.<\/p><p><br \/>  This is a form of double taxation and a mean attack on middle Ireland.  The Government must examine the matter again.  This year and last year it was factored into the Government's accounts and I ask it, at this late stage, not to go down the road of placing double taxes on people who work hard and try to lighten the burden on this State in providing health care.  These people will now have to pay twice when they enter a public hospital.  That arises from Government policy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government's amendment contains a slap on the back for this double taxation on people who can barely afford health insurance as it is.  It states that the D&aacute;il &quot;endorses the Government's policy of generating additional income for public hospitals, by addressing the present subsidy enjoyed by health insurers in respect of their private patients who occupy public hospital beds&quot;.  This is not a subsidy as the health insurers must pass on the cost to those who are consumers of private health insurance.  Health insurance companies are obligated to run a surplus and cannot run a deficit, as they work under regulations from the Central Bank.  They are obliged to pass such costs directly to the consumers, or the basic policyholders who already find it difficult to hold on to the very lowest type of plans offered by health insurers.  This is a nasty double taxation on middle Ireland and I urge the Government to revisit the matter as quickly as possible.<\/p><p><br \/>  We have raised another issue on numerous occasions.  The figures indicate that younger, healthier people are opting out of private health cover by no longer taking up private insurance or dropping plans.  Demographics indicate that there is an increased number of people on the other end of the scale.  If we are to have intergenerational solidarity, with one generation contributing to the welfare of another - the idea behind community rating, which we have all bought into - there must be some lifetime community rating to encourage young people into the private health insurance market.  The figures, as published by the Health Insurance Authority, back this up.<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2008, there were 334,000 people between the age of 18 and 29 with health insurance but last year there were 267,000 people in that group.  It is a massive drop.  On the other end of the scale, the group between 60 and 69 had 185,000 people in 2008, whereas in 2011, the group had 207,000 people.  Such a dynamic is completely unsustainable.  The Government is pretending there is a market that will provide vibrancy and competition when universal health insurance is imposed on the people.<\/p><p>There has been no great discussion so far because we are still waiting for the famous model and for the commission on universal health insurance to publish its findings.  In the meantime, the <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach to encouraging people to take up health insurance is simply untenable.  In the longer term, it will endanger elderly and sick people because there will not be a healthy swathe of young people taking up private health insurance to cross-subsidise those who most need it.<\/p><p><br \/> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to reconsider the three issues about which I have spoken.  I will be elaborating on them in greater detail tomorrow evening.  This amendment is an extremely farcical exercise in slapping oneself on the back for single-handedly destroying private health insurance and driving over 140,000 people out of the market since the parties opposite took up Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500043#QQ01900","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362512400,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate tonight on the spiralling cost of private health insurance.  I commend my party colleague Deputy Billy Kelleher on tabling the motion.  The high cost of health insurance is having a devastating and detrimental effect on households across the country.  It affects both young and old, despite the commitment in the programme for Government that the Government would act speedily to reduce the cost of the delivery of both public and private health care.  This simply has not occurred and circumstances have continued to deteriorate during the tenure of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in the Department of Health.<\/p><p>  The statistics are stark and cannot be defended by the Government.  According to the Health Insurance Authority, 2,099,000 people had inpatient health insurance plans at the end of December 2012.  This represents a reduction of 64,000 policyholders in 2012.  This followed a reduction of 65,000 people in 2011.  According to the CSO data from April 2012, the percentage of the population with inpatient insurance has fallen from a peak of 50.9% in 2008 to 45.8%.  These alarming statistics are compounded further by the staggering lack of progress of the Minister for Health on his trophy policy, the introduction of universal health insurance.<\/p><p>  When the Minister had an opportunity to support the measure that would have extended free general practitioner care to all newborn children in 2013, as outlined in Fianna F&aacute;il's pre-budget submission, A Fairer Way to Recovery, he declined it.  This policy would have gone some way towards meeting the Government's long-delayed commitment to providing free general practitioner care.  This was a missed opportunity.<\/p><p>  The number of policyholders with private health insurance is falling continually.  A more worrying trend concerns the high proportion of young people and families who have been priced out of the market and who have abandoned their health insurance cover.  This is the core demographic that health insurance providers should be targeting to ensure their own sustainability and the very future of the industry.  For the period 2008 to 2011, the number of those over 50 with inpatient health insurance increased by a further 50,000, while the number of policies for those under 50 fell by 122,000.  The main reason is that young people and families, who have suffered greatly in the recession, can no longer afford to purchase health insurance.  The four insurance providers operating in the market, VHI, Laya, Aviva and GloHealth, have all increased the costs of their policies over the period such that there has been a never-ending series of price hikes.  For example, GloHealth, which has been in the market for only less than a year, increased the premiums for its core plans, outpatient-only plans and cash plans on 30 January and 2 February this year.<\/p><p>  Young people with families have been left with two choices, that is, to give up health insurance entirely or downgrade their health insurance cover.  The knock-on effects have resulted in health insurers increasing their prices for loyal customers to cover the gap, in effect pricing a second group out of the market.  Despite this, the Minister for Health seems unconcerned and indifferent to this growing crisis.  How can consumers realistically shop around when the four insurers in the market continually hike their prices?  This position is simply untenable and the Minister will have to intervene.  The lack of concern shown by the Minister is in sharp contrast with the criticisms he levelled at the former Government in 2011 over the then price increase.  He spoke of the last straw for struggling families and claimed it would lead to increased demand on the public hospital system. Now, when the Minister has an opportunity to do something, he does not even consider the proposal that his Department research the impact of patients who have previously held private health insurance presenting in public hospitals.<\/p><p>  This is not the first time that we have seen evidence of the Minister's dramatic transformation from his time in opposition to when he entered government.  The concern remains but inaction is the adopted policy approach.  A policy of &quot;wait and see&quot; is simply not good enough from the Minister for Health.  Instead of stopping the haemorrhaging of consumers from the health insurance market, the trend has actually accelerated during the Government's term of office.<\/p><p>  This trend can be reversed if the Minister for Health takes on board a number of recommendations.  First, he needs to protect the 330,000 health insurance customers with lower levels of cover from another increase in the Government's health insurance levy in March.  He needs to renew his commitment to adopt a two-tier levy system for those with advanced and non-advanced cover.  The Health Insurance Authority, having examined the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012, has classified all of the plans on the market as not conforming to the Minister's definition of &quot;non-advanced&quot;.  As a result, all policies are now categorised as advanced and subject to the higher rate of levy.  The Minister needs to revisit urgently and revise the legal definition of a non-advanced plan.  If the current situation is not rectified, an individual paying &euro;500 for a lower-level plan, a very basic plan, will pay the same levy as someone who can afford to pay &euro;4,000 for a Rolls-Royce plan.  This raises fundamental questions with regard to equity and fairness since those on lower levels of cover are being asked to subsidise those with higher level health insurance policies.<\/p><p>  The Government needs to defer the increase in the health levy due at the end of March until a new definition for non-advanced plans is agreed.  The health insurance levy has already increased by nearly 80% since its introduction four years ago.  The CSO reports that health insurance premiums have risen by 60% over the same period.<\/p><p>  Children should be removed from the health levy criteria as a matter of priority.  Young families who are hard pressed during this recession need a break.  Intergenerational solidarity should be confined to those of 18 years and over.  Only last year the referendum on children was passed to strengthen children's rights in the Constitution.  How is it fair or equitable for the Government to expect children to support older and single people's health insurance costs through paying this levy?  Simply put, the levy on children needs to be abolished urgently.<\/p><p>  The Government needs to tackle the VHI and how it operates.  The Government, as its senior shareholder, has an important say in how it operates.  In 2005, the VHI had 1.7 million customers; today, the figure is 1.2 million, yet the number of staff has increased.  If it were a private company, it would have gone bust.<\/p><p>  The Government needs to ensure that patients who have private health insurance and pay their taxes do not lose their universal entitlement to public health care funded by the State.  Increased public hospital charges, including the proposed additional hospital bed charge, and their impact on the cost of private health insurance need to be addressed.  If the Government ignores the concerns of the insurers and the industry, it will, in effect, undermine the sustainability of the health insurance market.<\/p><p>  The phased introduction of lifetime community rating ought to be considered.  Such a move could be used to encourage younger people to purchase health insurance.<\/p><p>The prohibition on insurers negotiating with public hospitals must be lifted.  At present insurers can only negotiate a package price with private hospitals.  There is also a discrepancy between the five days and seven days in private and public hospitals, respectively, in the length of stay for VHI customers, which must be addressed.<\/p><p> Surely greater savings could be achieved if insurers could negotiate with public hospitals?  As a means of lowering costs in the industry, insurers must work together, with the support of the Department of Health, to develop industry standard clinical pathways.  Such a move would lead to the delivery of quality health care to customers in the most efficient manner.<\/p><p> This Government and the Minister for Health need to address the issues set out urgently to ensure the sustainability of private health insurance market in this country.  The people deserve better than the level of incompetence evident in the Department of Health and displayed by this Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500044#RR00200","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362513000,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I join Deputy Troy in commending Deputy Kelleher for putting forward this motion tonight.<\/p><p>  Health insurance is one of the payments that families have struggled to keep up at all costs as finances have become tighter.

For many, however, that struggle has become too difficult.  Since the Government has come into office, although the trend had already started, many people have stopped their health insurance.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately the Minister and the Government have failed miserably so far to grasp this issue and put a halt to the slide in the numbers with health insurance.  We now have a Minister who promised that, if elected, he would deliver universal health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500045#SS00200","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1362513000,"counter":563,"content":"<p>By 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500045#SS00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1362513000,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Instead, during the first two years in government, we have seen more 1,000 people leaving private health insurance every day and coming back into the public system.  Instead of those who need insurance getting public insurance and the services that would go with it, the opposite has been the case.  We have seen a real lack of leadership to bring our health services around and changing their operation.  Unfortunately, the Minister underwent a change of personality after the election.  When he was on the Opposition side of the House, he would solve it all but now he is in government, he is creating more problems than he can solve.<\/p><p>  We saw that with his ministerial team.  Instead of going from strength to strength and getting a handle on what was happening, we have seen one Minister of State leave the team to be replaced by Deputy White.  I wish Deputy White well in his role and I accept that the challenge of health service reform is very difficult and will take some time.  Unfortunately, from what we have seen up to now, there is little cause for confidence that the Government will reach that target.<\/p><p>  Since 2008, the number of people with health insurance has fallen from a record of just under 2.3 million to just under 2.1 million at the end of 2012.  The worrying thing about these figures is the imbalance in who has left the health insurance market.  If we look at the breakdown of age, we can see the problem.  The over 80s category has gone from just over 36,000 in 2008 to 44,000.  Likewise, the 70 to 79 age bracket has risen from 94,500 in 2008 to 110,000 in 2012.  Similarly, in the 50 to 59 category, there has been a rise from 266,000 to 271,000.  Once we look at the categories under the 50 age bracket, however, we see where the pain lies and where the imbalance is becoming pronounced in the health insurance system.  In the 40 to 49 age bracket, numbers have fallen from 320,000 to 312,000, while for those in their 30s, the numbers have fallen from 367,000 to 339,000.  The 18 to 29 bracket has seen numbers fall from 334,000 to 267,000 and further drop of 20,000 in the numbers who are 17 or under.<\/p><p>  The problem here is that this places more pressure on the health insurers.  Those who are continuing with their health insurance are older and perhaps more insulated from the recession, debt and family pressure compared with those under 50, and are therefore more able to sustain their health cover.  It is also that category who will make greater use of health insurance products and have a more immediate need to keep it up.  Those with families and who are younger might make less use of health insurance and have more demands on their weekly income, forcing them to drop out.  As a result, the health insurers find it becoming more and more expensive to provide health cover because those who have kept their policies are using them.  That is doubtless a factor in the increases in fees that we have seen.<\/p><p>  This is something the Minister said he would tackle, saying he would bring a halt to increases in private insurance costs, but that has not been the case.  At the start of the year, VHI announced further increases for 15 for their corporate plans and has now announced it will increase premiums on 50 plans by 4% to 8.5% on 1 March.  The latest 6% increase means the costs of some the State's largest health insurer's policies, typically held by older people, have risen by almost 70% in little more than two years, a massive increase by any standards.  The figures I outlined earlier show that older people have kept their health insurance up despite the 70% increase.<\/p><p>  The VHI announcement is the fifth increase in just over two years.  Last November it increased its prices by 3%, with similar trends across the other health care insurers, with Laya, Aviva and GloHealth also significantly increasing premiums in recent times.  This means the cost of health insurance has doubled in four years at a time when health inflation has been low and there has been deflation in the general economy.<\/p><p>  The latest evidence of the Government's failure to get a handle on the issue has been the breaking of the commitment to protect the 330,000 health insurance customers with lower levels of cover from another increase in the Government's health insurance levy in March.<\/p><p>These new problems arise from the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 and mean that everyone will pay the same additional levy regardless of what type of private health insurance policy they hold.  During the debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill last year the Minister for Health made a clear promise that there would be a two-tier levy system for those with advanced and non-advanced cover so that those with more basic cover would not end up subsidising the holders of more advanced policies.  It was expected that those on basic packages would face a &euro;5 increase while those on advanced policies would face a &euro;65 hike.  However, following on from the recent review of all policies by the Health Insurance Authority based on the wording of the Minister's legislation, Laya found that none of the plans on the market conform with the Minister's definition of non-advanced.  As a result, all policies are now categorised as advanced, meaning the same higher rate of levy will be applicable to all, making a mockery of the Minister's pledge here in advance of bringing in the legislation with regard to its impact.<\/p><p> The motion in the name of Deputy Kelleher, put forward on behalf of our party, asks that the Minister address the health levy, in particular, its impact on children.  Parents, who have the additional cost of putting a student through college and raising a family, are finding it most difficult.  If the Minister could address the levy cost on children, it would at least bring some relief to them.<\/p><p> Overall, we must see some meat on the bones of what the Minister is proposing in terms of universal health insurance.  What has been delivered so far, two fifths of the way into the Government's term, has been the opposite - fewer people with health insurance rather than everyone with health insurance.  That is a real failure and an indictment of the Government.  I hope to see some sense of confidence that the Minister and the Government know where they are going on this and some sense as well that there will be real change and real movement on this.  This will be a long-term project but it can only be a project if it gets moving and if we progress it.  We have not seen that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500045#SS00400","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362513600,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Kelleher on putting down this motion and I thank him for the opportunity to speak on it.<\/p><p>  There is a number of issues in this regard.  First, before I go into the motion itself, there are anomalies in the system.  As public representatives, we meet people who come to us who would have had paid up membership of VHI or other insurers who, because of one application or one day in respite, the two-week respite would not be granted under the cover.  Also, recently there was a difficulty with the contents of a policy where a person under the age of 30 had been diagnosed with a serious cancer and, because of specific rules and regulations, was put outside of the insurance cover and was not able to benefit from it even though the person had paid it and the person's family had paid it right through from the time the person had been a young child.<\/p><p>  The thrust of the motion relates to affordability of VHI cover and the situation families face who are making decisions on a daily basis as to whether they can continue with private health cover.  The Government has flagged many policies on universal health cover but it remains the case that families throughout the country are making decisions on whether they will be able to continue with private health insurance.  Those making that decision are predominantly within a certain age group.  I refer to young families, those who have mortgage difficulties and those couples who would have lost one or more jobs and maybe have a significant mortgage commitment and have all the other add-on costs of children going to school, perhaps children going to college, etc.  The families that are making these decisions are of the younger age group and are under considerable pressure.<\/p><p>  There does not seem to be any urgency from Government on this issue.  This affects entire sectors of the population, not only in the commuter belt but across the country.  In my constituency, there are many families making these decisions for purely economic reasons in that they do not have the money to continue with the health insurance cover that they probably have had since they were born.  The statistics on the numbers dropping out of the private health insurance market were quoted earlier.  Throughout the past years the Government parties were telling us that they would have a detailed plan in place and that almost at the touch of a button there would be a solution to the issue.<\/p><p>  The insurance companies, in particular, VHI, are preparing for more increases.  As one of my colleagues stated, the numbers availing of VHI cover has decreased dramatically and the number of those working within that organisation has increased dramatically.  There is no logic to it.  The company has never been able to explain properly how this correlates.  If the company operated in any other sector, it could not add up.<\/p><p>  Some of the private health insurance companies have told us that they have achieved savings by negotiating with consultants and others but the bottom line is that when the renewal letter comes in through the post for ordinary families with children the premium has increased and they are faced with a difficult decision.  This affects those families in terms of whether they can continue with health insurance cover.<\/p><p>  I came from such a family which would have had private health insurance up to a point and had to discontinue it in the mid-1980s.  That had significant repercussions down the line.  I do not want to dwell too much on my family situation but merely wish to state that I would have experience in this area.  If matters improve in ten or 15 years' time and it happens that the parents of those families will be in a position to get back into the private health insurance market, they will be penalised.  It behoves the Minister and the Government to look at this in a logical and sensible way to ensure that there is a reasonable decision made on it.<\/p><p>  The fact that families that have withdrawn from private health insurance is having a detrimental effect on others who want to continue in it in that there is a corresponding increase in the cost of cover.  Nowhere over the past two years have we seen a robust defence of what will be done except what was outlined in the programme for Government.  At this point, we need a clear indication that this will be tackled for the many families discussing their finances and looking at what they must cut back to continue providing for the children going to school, the extra-curricular activities and all the other associated costs.  Such costs are not excessive because the vast majority are looking at them in a realistic fashion.  What will the Government do from this point on?  If the roles were reversed, outside the doors of the House and elsewhere there would be passionate pleas regarding what we were doing wrong.  The reality is that there is nothing being done for the many thousands of people who are withdrawing from private insurance.  It is having a detrimental effect on those who are remaining in private health insurance.<\/p><p>  In ten or 15 years' time, this will have a bigger effect on the health service of this country.<\/p><p>We have seen what is likely to change in the demographics, but if we are not able to maintain the people in middle Ireland, who are working to sustain families, in the private health insurance market in the immediate term or in the next four, five or ten years when they will come to rejoin it, it will have a huge effect on it.  If they cannot rejoin, it will have serious consequences for the public purse and public policy.  Not alone for the families who are leaving now but for the people in ten, 15 or 20 years' time, and for society as a whole this is a most fundamental decision to make.  I appeal to the Minister to respond to the motion and outline what will be done in the short term to rectify the situation.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500046#TT00200","speaker":"987","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362514200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &#8220;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&#8221; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&#8220;strongly endorses the principal of community rating, whereby people can buy health insurance for the same price irrespective of their age or health status;<br \/><br \/>acknowledges with satisfaction the passing by the Oireachtas of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012, which introduced a permanent scheme of risk equalisation effective from 1st January, 2013;<br \/><br \/>commends the Minister for Health on the measures he is taking to protect community rating in the private health insurance market and recognises the support that risk equalisation provides to maintaining community rating in the market in helping to ensure the affordability of health insurance for older people;<br \/><br \/>supports the work of the Minister for Health to ensure a sustainable private health insurance market in Ireland;<br \/><br \/>welcomes:<blockquote><blockquote>&#8212; the success of the Minister for Health in securing the approval of the EU Commission for the new Risk Equalisation Scheme as a vital means of protecting the affordability of private health insurance for older and less healthy customers who are most likely to need it; and<br \/><br \/>&#8212; the notifications by insurers for categorisation of another 30 plans as non-advanced by the industry regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, to be made available to customers, with a corresponding lower rate of Stamp Duty, from 31st March, 2013; after that date new products can be introduced at any time subject to meeting a 30 day notification period and requirements for classification;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>notes that there is no need to amend the legal definition of non-advanced plans since they will be readily available to customers under the current definition;<br \/><br \/>supports the work of the Minister for Health to make private health insurance affordable for all who wish to purchase it;<br \/><br \/>welcomes and supports:<blockquote><blockquote>&#8212; the Government&#8217;s continuing work to address unacceptably high costs in the private health insurance market and shares the Minister&#8217;s concern that increases in private health insurance premiums are not justified in all circumstances; and<br \/><br \/>&#8212; the actions of the Minster for Health in requiring the VHI to address its cost base immediately, including action on the fees it pays to health professionals, auditing the volume of treatments it pays for and clinically reviewing the appropriateness of these procedures;<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>endorses the Government&#8217;s policy of generating additional income for public hospitals, by addressing the present subsidy enjoyed by health insurers in respect of their private patients who occupy public hospital beds;<br \/><br \/>further supports the continuing work on the Health Service Executive National Clinical Programmes in developing effective clinical pathways for patients that can be utilised by all health insurers; and<br \/><br \/>further endorses the actions of the Minister for Health designed to ensure a strong and competitive health insurance market as a key building block in the Government&#8217;s commitment to implement Universal Health Insurance.&#8221;<\/blockquote>I wish to share time with Deputies Mulherin and O'Mahony.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500047#UU00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1362514200,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I wish to correct the record of the House because all sorts of outlandish claims have been made from the far side on increases in insurance.  In 2009, health insurance increased by 11%; in 2010 it increased by 7%; in 2011 it increased by 10%; and last year it increased by 12.1%.  The trend started in 2008 and for more than three of those years the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government had responsibility for it.  It sold our financial sovereignty and left us with the biggest debt the country has ever seen, and Deputy Kelleher wonders why some of the costs of living have to increase.  His vision of reality is quite remarkable.<\/p><p>  There are a number of other important stepping-stones to achieving the goal of universal health insurance.  Good progress is under way in the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care, as well as ongoing work in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups.  When I came into government I set up a special delivery unit, SDU, in my Department.  The SDU started a major national programme aimed at helping hospitals to tackle the problems associated with delays in accessing care.  Hospitals were set ambitious targets and in the main they met them.  Through meeting them, clinicians adopted new ways of working.<\/p><p>  During 2012 there have been significant improvements in hospital access targets, including a reduction of 23.6% in the number of patients waiting on trolleys in 2012 compared with 2011, which equates to 20,352 fewer patients waiting on trolleys.  There are still too many people waiting on trolleys, but already in the first two months of this year we have seen a further reduction of 10% on 2012.  I remind the Deputy - his memory seems to fail him sometimes - that the month before the general election that saw the removal of his Government had the highest number of patients on trolleys since records began with 569.<\/p><p>  On scheduled care we set a nine-month target and the number of adults - excluding endoscopy - having to wait more than nine months for inpatient and day-case surgery was down to 86 at the end of December 2012, from 3,706 in December 2011, which is a 98% decrease.  The target for 2013 is a maximum wait-time guarantee of eight months.  In the paediatric area we set a 20-week access target and the number of children - excluding endoscopy - waiting over 20 weeks was down to 89 at the end of December 2012, from 1,759 in December 2011, which is a 95% decrease.  The number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for a routine GI endoscopy procedure reduced from 4,590 in December 2011 to 36 at the end of December 2012 representing a 99% decrease.<\/p><p>  All this was achieved despite having to remove more than &euro;3 billion from the health budget in recent years and despite several thousand people - most of them in February 2012 - leaving the health service.  We are trying very hard to ensure that by 30 November 2013 no patient will be waiting more than 52 weeks for a first-time consultant-led appointment.  I heard Deputy Kelleher say that he would cover more of this in his wrap-up speech tomorrow night.  Perhaps he would be good enough to tell us why, despite all its years in power, Fianna F&aacute;il never even bothered to count the number of people waiting on an outpatient waiting list.  This is the first Government to do so and we are not afraid to admit there is a problem and to say we will address it.  We have said we do not want any patient waiting longer than 52 weeks for a first-time consultant-led appointment by the end of this year.  That is a very ambitious target and we will seek to meet it.<\/p><p>  On access to GPs more than 1.8 million medical cards - the highest number in the history of the State - have been issued to individuals.  That is the highest in percentage and absolute terms.  The Bill to allow for the extension of free GP care to persons with prescribed illness will be published this year.  I am the first to acknowledge that we have been delayed in that regard, through a combination of very serious technical issues and the volume of legislation to go through the Oireachtas.  Progress continues to be made in building primary care capacity and in chronic disease management particularly for the management of diabetes.  Funding has been approved for the appointment of 17 clinical nurse specialists whose role will include supporting health-care professionals involved in the provision of care to their diabetes patients in both the primary and secondary-care settings.<\/p><p>  In moving towards universal health insurance, community rating is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance market.  This means that the price of health insurance for all persons should reflect the principle of intergenerational solidarity, that is, that the entire community of privately insured persons should contribute towards the higher costs of claims for older people and less healthy people.  Under community rating, everyone is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of his or her health.  Community rating therefore means that the level of risk a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  I know the Deputies on the far side of the House agree with that principle.<\/p><p>  The pricing of risk across the community of insured persons clearly requires robust mechanisms to share costs when there are several insurance companies in the market.  The standard transfer mechanism to support community rating is called risk equalisation.  The aim of risk equalisation is to look at the market as a whole and distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health conditions of all their customers.  Community-rated health insurance systems across the world use this as a means of providing the necessary support for the market.<\/p><p>An effective risk equalisation scheme creates an incentive for insurers to focus on innovation, greater efficiencies and improved customer service rather than on selecting customers based on risk.  This is the type of competition that is best for consumers.  In this context, I am pleased to note that two major reinsurers are now involved in providing underwriting services in the Irish market.  In the lead up to the introduction of universal health insurance it is critical that private health insurance remains affordable and that the market is competitive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500047#UU00900","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362514800,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500048#VV00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1362514800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I welcome that there are now four insurers competing in the Irish market.  If our policies were erroneous and misguided further insurers would not be coming into the market.  What they value is certainty into the future.  Insurers see risk equalisation for what it is.  It gives them the sense of certainty they need to compete in that market.<\/p><p>  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 which I introduced last November provides for the introduction, for the first time in this country, of a permanent risk equalisation scheme in the private health insurance market with effect from 1 January 2013.  I was gratified that the legislation was strongly supported on all sides in the D&aacute;il.  This support was a clear recognition of the vital part risk equalisation plays in maintaining stability in the private health insurance market.  The scheme provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older people but that older people receive risk equalisation credits equal to the amount of the additional premium so that all people continue to pay the same amount for a given health insurance product.<\/p><p>  The risk equalisation scheme encourages efficiencies as it compensates insurers for only a proportion of the higher costs of insuring older and less healthy people.  Insurers should then compete for market share by providing better services rather than competing for younger, healthier lives.  The risk equalisation scheme also provides for a cost subsidy from younger, healthier people to older, less healthy people.  The compensation is provided in favour of the individual consumer rather than any particular insurance company.  A company with a worse than average risk profile and, therefore, higher claims costs, will be a net beneficiary from the scheme while a company with a greater proportion of younger and healthier people will be a net contributor to the scheme but will benefit considerably from having much lower claims costs.<\/p><p>  In setting the rates for risk equalisation credits, following consultation with the Minister for Finance I had particular regard to the principal objective of the Health Insurance Act, which is to ensure that access to health insurance cover is available to consumers, with no differentiation between them, in particular as regards the cost of health services based on health risk status, age or sex.  I also had regard to the aims of maintaining the sustainability of the market, having fair and open competition in the health insurance market and avoiding the risk equalisation fund having a surplus or deficit from year to year.  If the risk equalisation is set at an appropriate rate, it should meet its costs, and no more.<\/p><p>  In operating the risk equalisation scheme it is important to ensure that those who purchase the more basic plans, with lower levels of cover, do not effectively subsidise customers who decide to purchase plans that provide higher levels of benefit.  With this in mind, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012 distinguishes between non-advanced and advanced plans.  The non-advanced or entry level plans will have a lower rate of stamp duty payable.  In addition to avoiding any unintended subsidisation of advanced plans, they also help to make the entry level plans as affordable as possible.  I am conscious of the concerns that have been expressed regarding the absence to date of any non-advanced plans which would attract the lower level of stamp duty.  It is important to note that the new stamp duty rates will come into effect for policies taken out from 31 March 2013 onwards.

I do not accept that medical inflation is in some way special or should be allowed to jeopardise affordable health care.  I have emphasised to insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible.  I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and I am determined to address costs in the sector in the interests of consumers.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last year, I established the health insurance consultative forum, which comprises representatives of the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority and Department of Health.  This forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, always respecting the requirements of competition law and giving a voice to insurers in the development of the new universal health insurance model.  I have made clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  I have requested the VHI to address its costs as a matter of urgency.  In particular, I have asked it to focus on auditing the volumes of procedures it pays for and to audit, from a clinical perspective, the appropriateness of procedures carried out before funding them.  I have also stressed to the VHI that it should critically examine the actual prices its pay to health professionals and to private hospitals.  I have emphasised the steps that I expect to be taken across the private health insurance industry so as to keep costs and resulting premia down.<\/p><p><br \/>  Just over 2.09 million or 45.8% of the population currently has private health insurance.  The number of people insured has fallen by 63,700 or 2.9% in the 12 months to end-2012, which is a continuation of the declining trend since the peak of 2.2 million, or 50.9% of population, at the end of 2008.  This reflects the general economic downturn Ireland is currently experiencing.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important they review their level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Government would strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  The Health Insurance Authority, HIA, provides information to consumers and its website, <i>www.hia.ie<\/i> has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since coming into office I have made some significant improvements to the measures in place to ensure that private health insurance remains affordable for older and less healthy people.  To keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I increased significantly, with effect from 1 January 2012, the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years or older.  Without this support, health insurers would have had an even stronger financial incentive to segment the market by offering policies targeted at young people, to the disadvantage of older customers.  With effect from end March 2013, the risk equalisation credits will increase substantially over 2012 levels for higher risk groups, particularly men aged 70 and over.  For example, the risk equalisation credit for a 75 year old male with advanced cover has increased by &#8364;400 or 20% and for an 85 year old male has increased even more, by &#8364;675 or 25%.  The Health Insurance Authority has confirmed, based on market average claim costs for prescribed benefits, that the 2013 scheme compensates for 75% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their 70s and compensates for 83% of the higher claims costs for those aged in their 80s.<\/p><p><br \/>  An additional consideration regarding the cost of health care delivery concerns the charging for public bed occupancy.  Under the current legal framework, private inpatients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge which in most public hospitals ranges from &#8364;586 to &#8364;1,046.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of inpatients treated privately by consultants were not charged maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds in public hospitals.  I have previously announced my intention to bring forward legislation to address this.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of Budget 2013, I announced further details on legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals.  Primary legislation will be introduced during 2013 to provide for charging of private inpatients in public hospitals, where they are not in a designated private bed.  On that basis, budget 2013 provides for additional patient income of &#8364;60 million in 2013.  This measure is designed to recoup some of the cost of treating private patients in public hospitals.  The current system, whereby private patients are charged only &#8364;75 per day when they occupy a public bed, represents an unsustainable subsidy to health insurers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500048#VV00700","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1362514800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>They are all taxpayers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500048#VV00800","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1362514800,"counter":584,"content":"<p>It is not fair and I am committed to addressing it by charging a realistic amount for this service.<\/p><p>  The recently published money follows the patient policy paper proposes the introduction of a new model of funding for public hospital care. <\/p><p>It involves changing from the current inefficient system of block grant budgets to a new approach where hospitals are paid for the actual level of activity they undertake.  This will be facilitated through the introduction of a prospective case-based payment system using diagnosis related groups.  The changes will effectively mean that hospitals will be funded on the basis of the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients and not the size of last year's budget.  This move is in line with the recommendations of a value for money and policy review which previously examined this issue.  It means if there are no patients, there will be no payment.<\/p><p> With regard to the national clinical programmes, it is in the interests of all patients, public and private, that effective clinical pathways are in place throughout the health system.  National clinical guidelines will help to improve further the quality, safety and cost effectiveness of health care throughout Ireland.  In the public health system, the HSE continues to work on national clinical programmes to improve and standardise patient care throughout the system.  The stroke programme has saved one life a week since its introduction and pre-empted the necessity for three patients a week to go into long-term care.  We also have a new early warning score card which will make a huge difference throughout the system.  We are the first country to put it in place nationally.  It will mean doctors and nurses in Tralee will operate on the same value set as doctors and nurses in Letterkenny, Beaumont Hospital or St. James's Hospital.<\/p><p> As I stated earlier, the Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system, the aim of which is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance where access is based on need, not on income.  I have already outlined the number of important stepping stones which are under way to pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance.<\/p><p> Contrary to the claims made by the Opposition, I believe we are taking the right steps to achieve a sustainable and robust private health insurance market.  The risk equalisation legislation is a key element of this.  Taken with the actions on addressing costs in the market, I am determined to ensure that private health insurance remains affordable.  My concern is to ensure the private health insurance market is ready to form a key building block for universal health insurance.  In the meantime, the Government will work intensively to ensure a well-functioning insurance system for our people.  I urge insurers to take all appropriate means to address their costs and to keep premium rises to the absolute minimum.  There is much room for improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500048#VV00900","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362515400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  Health insurance is a vicious circle as the more people who leave it, the more expensive it becomes and then more people leave it.  It is an issue for lower income families, not least on account of the fact that those on higher incomes get tax breaks on their health insurance premium.  The measure of the cost of cover, perhaps &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 for a family, is not based on one's income but on risk.  Any steps which can be taken for those who genuinely want health insurance but find it is outside their grasp should be pursued.  We must also recognise the tax break is not as attractive or significant for lower income families.<\/p><p>  I very much welcome the concept being pursued by the Minister of money following the patient.  It makes sense that hospitals and health services are paid on the basis of the service they provide and are not blindly given a block grant, the details of which can lead to inefficiencies.  I welcome the development of a more efficient system as we move towards universal health care, which will be very much welcome.<\/p><p>  Sometimes we forget the onus is on health insurance companies to challenge the costs charged by hospitals and consultants, and in doing so reduce the cost of health cover.  In some cases insurance companies are handed a bill and very little checking is done to see what they get for their money.  They simply pay.  They have a role to play in demanding efficiencies in hospitals, including the use of step-down beds.  We must think outside the box.  Perhaps a patient having a day procedure but who needs to be seen the following morning could be put into a hotel at a much lower rate, depending on medical requirements.  We must examine the costs and be creative in how they are reduced.  At all times we should look towards reducing costs and making health care and health insurance affordable.<\/p><p>  While I have the opportunity to do so, I wish to raise briefly the problems being encountered with the fair deal scheme, whereby older persons experience inordinate and excessive delays in having their applications processed.  Not only does this mean they remain in local community hospitals where they take up what should be step-down beds, but in some cases they are in acute hospital beds, which means other patients are on trolleys.  Money is being put towards caring for the elderly in long-term residential care, with approximately &euro;1 billion being invested last year and more than 22,500 people being provided for through schemes such as fair deal and subvention.  None the less this problem prevails and is a real issue for hospitals which experience blockages.  People cannot leave hospital because they cannot get approval under the fair deal scheme.  I am not sure how it can be addressed because properties secured after someone's death cannot be sold.  The question is what is the market value of a property which cannot be sold.  There inherent problems are caused by the economy and the property market.  With regard to efficiencies and expensive hospital beds being taken up, something must be done to allow the more rapid processing of fair deal scheme applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500049#WW00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1362515400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I am glad to contribute to the debate on this Private Members' motion.  I acknowledge it is an issue for the public and I thank Deputy Kelleher of Fianna F&aacute;il for raising the matter.  It is also important to point out this has not just become an issue in the past two years.  The price of an average private health insurance policy increased by 11% in 2009.  We are aware of the declining trend in membership from a peak of 2.3 million to 2.1 million people and 67,000 people gave up their policies last year.  This problem is exacerbated by the fact it is younger people who cannot afford it because they have so many other issues such as unemployment or mortgages.  Once they opt out it puts pressure on the health service and this increases membership prices because under the schemes we have and the method used, there is less money to subsidise older people, 12% more of whom have taken out health insurance.<\/p><p>  The need for community rating and the concept of risk equalisation is accepted by and large.  This would mean everybody would be charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan irrespective of age, gender and current and future likely risks to health.  This can lead to anomalies.  A male constituent of mine recently asked me why he must pay for maternity cover when he does not expect to get pregnant any time soon.<\/p><p>Why can private health insurance not provide a range or menu of packages from which people can pick what they want?  It would be a bit like car insurance, which can be third party, fire and theft or comprehensive.  We need to look at health insurance in new ways.<\/p><p> There are benefits to be had from shopping around, but until recently members of the public did not take advantage of the competition between various companies.  There is a tendency, especially with the older generation to stay where they always have been.  Nonetheless there are large savings to be made by shopping around and comparing the various health premiums.<\/p><p> It is important to review the level of cover and ensure that needs are being met without being over-insured.  In the past, some people have spent money on being over-insured.  The message should go out that people have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and thus reduce costs.<\/p><p> I would like to comment finally on the pace at which private health insurance companies pay hospitals for procedures.  I was astounded at the end of last year to find that &euro;47 million was owed to hospitals in the HSE west region.  Some &euro;4,208,000 was owed in the case of Mayo General Hospital.  That is a huge figure which is simply not acceptable.  I commend the Minister for the efforts he made to reduce that.  Galway University Hospital and Merlin Park Hospital were owed over &euro;10 million.  At a time when hospitals are trying to meet budgets they need to get the money they are due. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500049#WW00300","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362516000,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 in my name reads:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;calls on the Government to&quot; and substitute the following:&quot;- in the interim, ensure the proper working of the system of risk equalisation to support the community rating principle, entailing the transfer of compensation from insurers who carry lighter risk burdens to those who carry heavier risk burdens, preventing unregulated market discrimination against the old and the sick or any other group or individual that insurance companies may decide are a greater risk;<br \/><br \/>- take measures to improve access to healthcare for all who need it;<br \/><br \/>- abandon its plan to base the health system on the discredited model of competing private health insurance companies;<br \/><br \/>- adopt a new approach based on universal access to equitable and efficient public health services based on medical need alone, funded from fair general taxation.&quot;<\/blockquote>  The focus of the Fianna F&aacute;il motion is on health insurance.  It should, in my view, be on health care and how we fund our health care system.<\/p><p><br \/>  The first part of the motion describes the situation as it is and is not objectionable.  The second part is not acceptable to me and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in.  It supports the maintenance of the current two-tier, public-private system that is at the root of the crisis in our health services.  This is not surprising.  More than any other party, Fianna F&aacute;il is the architect of the grossly inequitable two-tier system that has afflicted the delivery of health care in this State for decades.  A former Fianna F&aacute;il health Minister said that the two-tier system had served us well.  At least he acknowledged it was a two-tier system but his successors pretended that health care apartheid did not exist.<\/p><p><br \/>  We saw the private health care system piggy-backing on the public system at huge cost to the State, the taxpayer and, above all, at the expense of the public health system.  Citizens were paying for health through taxes, through charges and, in many cases, through health insurance premiums.  That situation still maintains.<\/p><p><br \/>  When in office, during the Celtic tiger period, Fianna F&aacute;il, under health Ministers Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, former Deputy Brian Cowen and former Deputy Mary Harney, boosted the private for-profit health sector as never before.  Property-based tax breaks enriched the privateers.  Private health insurance was encouraged.  The failure to properly reform and resource front-line health care services - as distinct from the HSE bureaucracy - led many citizens to conclude that private health insurance was the only guarantee of decent health care.  All of this has, of course, been followed by the inevitable collapse.<\/p><p><br \/>  There has been a massive decline in the number of people with private health insurance.  In 2008, there were 2.3 million people with private health insurance.  In 2012, that has dropped to 2.1 million, while the cost of premiums is rising.  People who have dispensed with insurance because they can no longer afford it are now totally dependent on the public health system which is under attack from this Government's failed austerity strategy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The State continues to heavily subsidise the private for-profit health system with private beds in public hospitals, a fast-track to care for private patients while public waiting lists grow, and the dual working of hospital consultants in the public and private sectors continuing apace.  As I said in the debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, that legislation is supposed to be a protection against the working out of the raw profit motive in the health insurance sector.  It is supposed to be based on solidarity between generations and between the healthy and the sick.  That is welcome, in so far as it goes but we in Sinn F&eacute;in would go much further, extending the principle of solidarity to the way we fund, organise, structure and manage our entire health care system.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 is based on the recognition that there has to be social solidarity within the insurance sector, that the market has to be regulated to prevent price discrimination against the old and the sick.  Given this, normal commercial competition cannot exist, otherwise we would have a US-style law of the jungle where the young and the fit would benefit from cut-price health insurance and the old and the ill would be fleeced or driven out altogether.  Instead, the principle of social solidarity is recognised.  That is a very welcome position from which to start.  Why not then take the next step and extend social solidarity across the entire health care system?  That is my appeal to the Minister.<\/p><p><br \/>  If one takes that solidarity to its logical conclusion then one moves to a system of universal provision of health care based on need, and need alone, and not on ability to pay.  The question then is how to pay for such a system.  Contrary to the frequent assertions of the Minister and others, we in Sinn F&eacute;in recognise that health care is hugely expensive and has to be paid for.  The question is how to pay for it in a way that ensures the best possible health care for all who need it, and which does so with the best achievable value for money.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is proposing to bring in universal health insurance with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay insurance premiums.  The State will still have a huge regulatory, managerial and funding role.  Why then give private for-profit insurance companies such a central place in the system?  What contribution will they make?  They are funded by consumers who buy their products.  The insurance companies, on behalf of policy-holders, will buy services from private or public hospitals, or other service providers.  They will have to make a substantial profit in the process.  Their shareholders will expect it and demand it.  Why not cut out that profit for the privateers and keep the money in the health system and in the pockets of our citizens?<\/p><p>The only possible reason for not keeping out the profiteers is not a health care reason but a commercial reason.  In going for the privatised insurance model, albeit including a slimmed-down VHI in the mix, the Government is putting business before health.  For citizens the bottom line is that when they need health care, they need it promptly and need the best care possible.  Everyone is exactly the same in that regard.  This is the reason Sinn F&eacute;in advocates universal health care based on equal access for all.  We want that to be State-provided, funded from fair general taxation and free at the point of delivery.  This would involve a higher contribution in tax from the highest earners than they contribute at present.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not favour the model of insurance-based funding for the reasons I have outlined.  If health insurance is to be the basis for funding, then it should be a State insurance scheme.  The Labour Party once claimed to be in favour of this but their former policy has been suppressed in favour of Fine Gael's stance on this matter.  The least desirable model, as far as Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned, is an insurance system based on competing private health insurance companies.  In that case, the profit motive and the interests of shareholders become paramount, rather than public health.  This is the Fine Gael model and it won out clearly in the negotiations on the programme for Government.<\/p><p><br \/> I have referred this to the Minister previously but on 8 November 2012, the trade union IMPACT published an important paper entitled, The Future of Healthcare in Ireland.  I make no apologies for again putting on the record its observations on the Government's plans:<blockquote>The Government&#8217;s model of competing private sector insurers has not been properly tested.  Delays in its implementation suggest that Government plans for UHI have been poorly thought out.  If implemented, the model is unlikely to deliver equity, value for money, quality or universal access.  Quite the opposite: lessons from the Netherlands show that a profit-driven commercial model led to an inequitable and inefficient system of funding, different tiers of entitlement, rising hospital deficits, and even bankrupt hospitals.<\/blockquote>That is a very different view of the Dutch system to the glowing reviews of the Minister and Fine Gael.  The IMPACT paper recommends examination of what it calls a single payer social insurance model along the lines of France, Germany and the Nordic countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500050#XX00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>May I conclude on this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Very well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":594,"content":"<p>It states, quite rightly in Sinn F&eacute;in's belief, that the \"competing insurers\" model should not be adopted before all the options have been evaluated in terms of equity, quality, access to services and value for money.<\/p><p>  As I understand my time has concluded-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00500","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":595,"content":"<p>The Deputy may have another minute of my time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00600","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":596,"content":"<p>May I take a minute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00700","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>Yes, Deputy McLellan has given a minute to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY00800","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McLellan.  It is good to have friends in the House.<\/p><p>  At present we have decreasing numbers of people with health insurance, rising premiums for those who have, more pressure on the public health system from those coming off insurance and the persistence of the two-tier public-private system with the struggling public system subsidising the private system.  Sinn F&eacute;in has calculated, based on Government figures, that were the Government to apply the full cost of private beds in public hospitals, it would save &euro;432.5 million.  This sum could then be spent in the public system to reduce waiting times and overcrowding in hospitals and to improve services.  One must ask what is the real prospect of change under the Government.  Already the promised extension of free GP care has been postponed.  The programme for Government promised the White Paper on financing universal health insurance early in the Government's first term.  The Department of Health's recent briefing for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children states it will be published as early as possible within the Government's term of office.  Members are all still waiting.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, I believe choosing the insurance route is a mistake and this private insurance mix certainly is.

Like my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, in theory I do not have a problem with the first section of the Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' motion.  However, in keeping with Sinn F&eacute;in policy and my views on this subject, I have serious concerns, both politically and ideologically, regarding the second part of the motion.  Therefore I support my party's amendments and concur with the view that this motion should be about health care and not, as Fianna F&aacute;il would have it, private health insurance.  Any discussion on the issue of health insurance, no matter how politically progressive and socially enlightened, carries with it a sub-text in respect of issues of access, management and profitability.  In other words, it raises questions regarding who can afford to pay, how much it will cost and how efficient it will be.  In planning or imagining a decent health care system for a modern state in the 21st century, these questions merely serve to reinforce both in material and ideological terms the system of apartheid that currently exists in the provision of health care in Ireland.  That Fianna F&aacute;il would wish to perpetuate this system should come as no shock because when in office, Fianna F&aacute;il, under the ministries of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, Brian Cowen and Mary Harney, vigorously pursued a policy of vulgar privatisation of the State's health service that Members now know has had a devastating impact on the provision of public health care in this country.<\/p><p>  Today, our public health care system is essentially broken, and this is in spite of the gallant efforts of the medical, nursing and domestic staff who work tirelessly, day in and day out, to keep the system going.  The appalling situation has arisen whereby the working poor and the under-employed will delay going to the doctor due to the high cost associated with such a visit.  Many people cannot afford to pay for medication because they simply do not have the money.  Seriously ill people wait for months if not years to see a specialist.  The free dental scheme, which is so important for the disabled, the poor and the vulnerable has been all but dismantled.  This unfortunately is the reality of health care in today's Ireland.  We have a dysfunctional public health care system, which in large measure is a legacy of Fianna F&aacute;il's love affair with privatisation.  In many ways tonight's Private Members' motion reflects this distorted thinking about health care.  Any discussion about the provision of health care must begin from the premise of universal access.  For-profit models do not belong in this discussion as they serve to reproduce a system that is inherently unequal and seriously disadvantages the working poor and the vulnerable.  Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to building a universal public health care system that is found in most modern advanced states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY01000","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>The next slot is for Deputies Healy and Pringle, who have two and a half minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY01100","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1362516600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>The private health insurance industry is in crisis.  As Members are aware, almost 70,000 people have left the sector in the past 12 months, having been simply unable to afford the premia, which have been pushed up year after year by huge levels of inflation.  The latter have been far in advance of the normal rates of inflation and far above health sector inflation.  Young people simply are unable to afford the premia now and this is pushing up the payments and insurance premiums for the remaining people, who mainly are older people.  It simply is unwise and unsustainable to hand over the public health service to competing health insurance companies.  I believe this to be unacceptable and unsustainable.  A public health service must be provided in which access is based on medical need alone, which is funded from general taxation and which is operated by a body that is transparent, publicly accountable and widely representative of all stakeholders, including patients and staff.  Furthermore and importantly, it must be legally obliged to consult stakeholders prior to any decisions being made.  This brings me to an appalling situation that arose in south County Tipperary last week, in which a decision was made to transfer a rehabilitation unit from St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, with absolutely no consultation with patients, their representatives, staff, medics or any stakeholders.  Staff and stakeholders were treated with absolute contempt.<\/p><p>The HSE sent an official to announce this decision and gave no details about it whatsoever.  This is deeply traumatic for patients and staff and is completely unacceptable.  If the Minister would listen to me, he should instruct the HSE to consult stakeholders in future and immediately prior to making decisions, and introduce legislation that would give them an entitlement to be consulted prior to the making of any decisions.  The conduct of the HSE in South Tipperary over the past week has been absolutely appalling.  It shows absolute contempt for all stakeholders, including staff, and that must stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500051#YY01200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362517200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I do not support either this motion or the Government amendment.  This Fianna F&aacute;il motion is a total contradiction, calling on the Government to reduce both the cost of health provision and of private health insurance premiums.  There are many reasons for the increases in the premiums, mainly that 70,000 people have given up their health insurance in the past year due to the effect of the recession and the fact that they can no longer afford it, leading to a cycle of increased premia.  Part of the reason for this increase has been a welcome move to reduce the subsidy that the health service gives to health insurance companies.  Making private health insurers pay for the actual cost of the health care that many who have insurance cover receive from the State is the right thing to do.  Fianna F&aacute;il want the cost of insurance and health care reduced.  Do they want this to be achieved by including a reduction in the wages of health care workers in the Croke Park extension?  I do not see any other proposals here.<\/p><p>  In its amendment the Government claps itself on the back about the changes it is making in the health services.  We will hear the rubbish again about how universal health insurance will solve all the problems in the health services.  It is interesting to note that the Labour Party has dropped all its talk of universal health care, which is completely different from insurance, but Labour has been captured by Fine Gael and will go along with the universal health insurance model.<\/p><p>  The Government plans to hand the health services over to the private sector and give control to the insurance companies, a system that has seen the cost of health insurance in Holland treble since the introduction of universal health insurance, which the Government says is the way to go.  Holland is the only country in Europe where hospitals are going bankrupt because universal health insurance has made sure that the money for health care goes to fewer and fewer hospitals.  The Government plans will ensure the health insurance companies will make all the gains.  They will dictate the price in the future and the Oireachtas will not be able to do anything about it.  Almost &euro;2 billion is paid in health insurance premia in this State.  If that money was raised in taxation on those who can pay it and put into a health service, there would be no need for private health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500052#ZZ00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362517200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2013: Committee Stage (Resumed) and Remaining Stages","time":1362517200,"counter":605,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500052#ZZ00400"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362517200,"counter":606,"content":"<p>SECTION 1<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1362517200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1362517200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Prior to the adjournment of this debate I was asking the Minister to answer at some point this evening the question that his Government has failed to answer despite this issue being debated across the country and to some extent, although severely curtailed, in this House.  How are people in mortgage distress who are unable to pay their mortgages supposed to pay this charge?  They simply cannot do it.  The Minister has not answered that question.<\/p><p>  We hear the Government talk about its desire to see people stay in their family homes but if it forces people to pay this tax when they cannot pay their distressed mortgages, more people will be forced into arrears and default.  With the IMF breathing down the Minister's neck demanding that banks have the right to repossess homes, this is a recipe for more people to lose their family homes.  How is any one of the 430,000 people who have no job, who are surviving on &euro;188 per week, or someone surviving on the State pension, which is worth approximately the same amount, or even someone who has an additional modest occupational pension, supposed to pay this tax?  It is a sure-fire recipe to drive people who are already living on the bread line into poverty, an unsustainable situation.<\/p><p>  It is coming up to Easter, the time of miracles, if the Minister believes in all that kind of thing, but unless he is proposing the economic equivalent of the miracle of the loaves and the fishes for the whole country, how are people supposed to manage this?  They simply cannot.  The idea that deferral of payments is somehow an acceptable concession on the Minister's part to deal with this problem is preposterous because what he is offering people is years and years of being in the appalling situation of trying to pay back mortgages they cannot manage, and maybe if they can get out of this situation, they will be faced with a massive debt.  Is that really what the Minister is offering to people?<\/p><p>  I would like a response to the other important point I raised today, if possible.  Our more general point has been that the alternative to this is a real wealth tax, levied on those with real wealth, the multi-millionaires, the billionaires, the people with very high earnings, in excess of &euro;100,000, the many tens of thousands of people on high incomes, or an increase in tax on the super-profitable corporations which the Minister seems to view as sacrosanct.  Whatever other sector of our society has to be battered with cuts, taxes and charges, the Minister refuses even to discuss the possibility of imposing an extra bit of tax on this super-profitable corporate sector.  He has never really answered that question except to offer meaningless drivel about not taxing jobs, which I fail to understand when his taxes have helped sustain a level of mass chronic unemployment.<\/p><p>  As if to add insult to injury, this is not even an equitable tax, within its own terms, on homes, which the Minister says it is, or on what he calls a property asset.  In the definitions of liable residential property in the Bill that was rammed through under a guillotine before Christmas, the value of gardens and areas adjacent to the house will be calculated in working out the amount of property tax people have to pay, but if the area is over one acre the gardens or estates that may surround the homes of wealthy people with big houses or mansions will not be calculated.  The mansions and the super-wealthy are protected.  How can the Minister justify that?  The value of a small bit of a garden or a back yard will be taken into account when calculating the tax the Minister intends to impose but the large gardens and sprawling estates that many wealthy people have with their large houses will not be liable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500052#ZZ00700","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362517200,"counter":609,"content":"<p>The Deputy should be aware that this is a definition section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500052#ZZ00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1362517200,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I know and I am pointing out that it is not, as the Government claims, a property tax because a considerable amount of the property of the very wealthy will not be taken into account.

We will discuss the details as we move through the Bill in the short time available but the Minister has never responded to the substantial issues put to him about the injustice of this tax and I wonder whether he will do so now or if this is why he has curtailed this debate in such an undemocratic way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500052#ZZ00900","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1362517800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I will not take too long because many of the points have been made already.  I want to put on record my objection to this being called a local property tax because it is neither local nor based on property.  A number of years ago, the Labour Party, in a coalition Government, introduced a tax on houses worth over a certain value.  The wealthy went on strike and the property tax was done away with.  This is not about extending or broadening the tax base.<\/p><p>  I am sure the Minister has seen posters calling for meetings of the campaign against the whole tax and water tax.  The meetings have been small to date, although some of been big, strong and angry.  People see this as a draconian tax and feel they are living in an economic dictatorship where the Government rams taxes on ordinary people's homes.  This is a home tax, it involves the place where people live and not assets.<\/p><p>  The Minister made the point that he is trying to deal with some of these issues and that he listened to us the last time.  The Minister listened to us because he realised, particularly with local authority housing, that many local authorities had not budgeted for this year in terms of introducing a home tax.  They need this year to change their budgets for next year and then to increase the rents on people living in local authority houses.  These are not assets, these people are renting their homes and not thinking about buying them.  That exposes the lie about that point.<\/p><p>  On 5 March, some tenants in Dublin City Council local authority housing will be paying an extra &euro;19 per week in rent.  Local authorities are looking to increase rent for local authority tenants.  I have had discussions with people about maintenance and mould problems in people's local authority homes.  Local authorities are pointing to the amount of money private landlords receive and the rents local authority tenants are paying.  They are considering increasing rents.  The &euro;19 per week increase will be introduced on 5 March.  There is also the issue of deferment to next year of the local authorities paying the home tax.<\/p><p>  This will be the rock on which the Government perishes.  People will be very angry and the campaign against the home and water taxes will call meetings.  As the leaflets are dropped into people's homes after 11 March, there will be a big response in attendance at public meetings held to discuss how to change the situation.<\/p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is saying this is the wrong tax at the wrong time.  If it was in government it would be saying it is the right tax at the right time.  I do not take much notice of what that party says.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500053#AAA00100","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1362517800,"counter":612,"content":"<p>My first point concerns the process.  Members of the Oireachtas Select Sub-Committee on Finance have three days, from morning to night, dealing with the Finance Bill.  If the Government wanted to give this Bill substantial time at that select sub-committee, which includes Opposition Members and many excellent Government Members, it could be done.  This is stifling parliamentary debate.  The Minister should be careful because the more the Cabinet treats the people's Parliament with contempt, the more the people treat Deputies with contempt.  The latest European trust barometers show the Irish people have the second lowest level in Europe of trust in their politicians.  I ask the Minister to be careful when he does things like this because, ultimately, it hurts the Parliament and the country.<\/p><p>  My second point concerns definitions.  During Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach stated, incorrectly, that gardens are not part of the valuation.  We know that, up to one acre, gardens are included.  I ask the Minister to correct that point because I would not like Government Deputies with incorrect information to vote in favour of a Bill.<\/p><p>  My third point deals with the Bill.  I do not have a problem with a local service charge as long as it goes fully to local services and as long as it takes accounts of the net value of the house, stamp duty paid, ability to pay and regional variation in price.  I examined average house prices for three-bedroom semi-detached houses across the country.  People in the Minister's constituency will pay 2.6 times less than people in my home town.  One could argue it is because they are living in more expensive houses, which is true, but they are not living in bigger houses.  Public sector employees are paid exactly the same amount.  Recently, I was knocking on doors in Greystones and a garda came to the door at 7 p.m.  He was very angry and he told me to come in.  He pointed to a cheese toastie on the table and he said that is all he had left.  He did not have money left after various cuts to overtime and pay.  He could not afford to buy himself a proper dinner.  The property tax will probably hit him with a bill of &euro;500.  He does not have it and he is not paid any more than anyone in the Minister's constituency or, interestingly, in the Taoiseach's constituency.  People in those two constituencies will pay 2.6 times less than people in my home town.  They are the same public sector workers paid the same wage with the same issues.<\/p><p>  We will not get to all amendments tabled for this Bill.  Can the Minister explain to the other members of the Oireachtas Select Sub-Committee on Finance why he is proceeding in this ways?  This is bad policy.  I do not understand why regional variation is not included, nor why ability to pay is not included.  I would appreciate the Minister explaining to the sub-committee and to the other Deputies why he will force through legislation that does not account for aspects Members from the Minister's party have described as so unfair as to potentially cause a revolution in the country.  That was the description of a very sensible Deputy.<\/p><p>  Technically competent amendments have been submitted to this Bill.  The amendments from the Technical Group, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fianna F&aacute;il are technical, sensible amendments.  Why is the Minister pushing something through that seems to fail a test of fairness and ability to pay on so many fronts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500053#AAA00200","speaker":"1107"},{"type":"speech","time":1362517800,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I, too, have serious reservations about the property tax.  I highlighted the case of being asked to put a value on a farmhouse.  The farmhouse could be located in the centre of the family farm and alongside sheds.  How can someone realistically put a value on the property?  While the house is a home to the family living in it, who else would want to purchase a house in the middle of a working farm?  To me, the house is worthless on the open market.  Who would want to be listening to cows roaring in the middle of the night without owning the cows?  It is bad enough to have to go out to them when one owns them but one does not want to have to listen to someone else's cows.  The farmyard activity that goes on in the yard ensures those houses are not saleable items on the open market.  Therefore, they have no market value because no one would want them so those people should not be paying any tax.  However, that has not been highlighted.<\/p><p>  I know Deputies in the Chamber and other people, who are unfortunately not here, put up a great battle on the pyrite issue.  I am delighted they won their battle.  What about people suffering from radon?  Why is there no exemption for them?  On the pyrite issue, plenty Deputies were representing large amounts of people.  They got a large weight going behind them.  I am delighted they did and I compliment every one of them.<\/p><p>They all know who they are.  Why did we not get a weight going behind us on the radon issue?  The reason is that the people who have radon in their houses predominantly live in the countryside where limestone and naturally occurring features lead to their houses becoming poisoned by this gas.

The Minister is a reasonable and fair man.  My point is sound and solid.  The houses in question are not being exempted because they are not located in Dublin, Cork or Limerick.  It is unfair.  Someone's family member might have died because of radon - I have experience of this - yet that person is now being asked to pay a property tax.  Such people can only continue living in their homes because they pay a fee every year to ensure that the radon remains suppressed.  The average seems to be between &euro;150 and &euro;350.  Tonight, they are being told that they must pay a tax.  It is unfair.<\/p><p>  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute.

It is solely a family home tax.  I remind the Minister that, while in opposition, the Taoiseach told us that any attempt to tax the family home would be unfair.  He may also have called it immoral.  If I am not mistaken, the Minister made a similar comment while in opposition.<\/p><p>  This family home tax will mainly hit middle and low-income families.  As we know from credit union surveys and so on, such people have already been hit by austerity and have little or nothing left at the end of the month after paying their bills.  According to the most recent of a number of surveys by the credit union movement, 1.8 million families each have only &euro;50 left at the end of the month.<\/p><p>  The section of the Act that exempts so-called gardens of more than 1 acre indicates that this is a family home tax.  It disproportionately advantages wealthier people who have estates and large gardens around their large homes while disadvantaging people who live in normal semi-detached houses.<\/p><p>  Even at this late stage, will the Minister agree to lift the guillotine on this debate?  The guillotine prevents Deputies from carrying out their responsibilities as elected Members.  There is a question over the constitutionality of the primary Act because of the manner in which it was passed before Christmas, in that it was driven through the House by the use of a guillotine and many amendments were not debated.  Tonight, many amendments will again not be debated.  Not just the Opposition, but also the Minister's colleagues on the other side of the House are being deprived of their constitutional right and responsibility to ensure that any legislation passed by the House is properly perused and dissected.

He also personalised the payment of the tax by suggesting that the Taoiseach and I would have no problem in paying.  He said that when the letter would drop on the Taoiseach's mat he would not have a problem in writing a cheque for it.  We can return that in kind.  I do not think Deputy Adams will have any problem either paying tax on his house in Louth or on his house in Donegal because he does not seem to have any problem paying a much higher property tax on his house in Belfast.  If we want to get personal we can throw brick-bats across the House.  On the other hand, I admire Deputy Doherty's quoting of Dick Mulcahy.  I did not think he was a student of his.

However, I disagree with people who say a house is worth nothing.  I think it was Deputy Healy Rae who said that if one was kept awake at night by the neighbour's cows looking over the wall, that would impair the value of one's house.  It would, of course, and if there is a silage pit in the yard, it would impair the value of one's house too but to say the house is worth nothing is ridiculous.

We should not exaggerate the position.  Everything has value and all we are asking is that people put a value on it.  Obviously, if a residence is seriously impaired by the activity of the householder, whether that be farming, business or anything else, which reduces the value, that will be reflected in the self-assessment.  It is up to people to decide what value to attribute to the house and they will get guidance from the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Healy made a general speech and made a lot of good points.  He challenged the constitutionality of the legislation.  It is generally known by Deputies that no Minister can introduce legislation unless he receives a stamped copy from the Attorney General.

That is not true because in many cases, the adaption of a house to suit disabled persons will reduce the value and in some cases, quite substantially.  Deputies will be familiar, from their constituency work, with this and cannot tell me that the changes that have to be made, of necessity, to suit disabled persons increase the value of houses, if Deputies have ever been in a house that has been adapted.  Of course, that will be reflected in the valuation and the Revenue Commissioners are reasonable people.  I cannot see them pursuing anybody who explains that the value of their house has gone down because it had to be adapted for use by a disabled person.<\/p><p>  The last point I would like to make concerns people's challenge to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners were being entrusted with the collection of this tax.  Revenue is the State agency that is responsible for collecting taxes so who better to collect it?  One of the problems with the flat-rate tax was that it was inadequately collected, despite the best efforts of those that were given the responsibility.  Revenue is setting about this in a systematic way and is giving very clear information.  Deputies have made some good points but we have before us an amendment Bill with 16 sections.

It has claimed a number of lives, for instance, and is seriously affecting the general health of people who are unfortunate to be living in areas affected by the gas.  Time will tell regarding the overall implications for the general public who have to live in houses affected by radon.  It is a modern phenomenon because of the high standard of housing and of insulation in particular.  Given the huge cost of energy and of oil in particular, people have a very high level of insulation in their homes but the side effect of this is that the radon is trapped in the houses.  People are very unfortunate to be in this situation.  Perhaps their houses are not worthless, as the Minister has said, but they are hugely devalued, which is the kernel of the problem.  Some mechanism will have to be worked out to make allowances for a large proportion of the population of County Kerry.  Remediation measures can be carried out but they are not 100% effective and are very costly as they rely on electricity to power fans to extract the air.<\/p><p>  There is a very serious disincentive in the Bill to carry out remediation works or general improvements in so far as they could raise the value of the house, which obviously has implications for the householder.<\/p><p>For example, this may happen if people need to build extensions to family homes.  This tax will be a significant deterrent.

Management says its hands have been legally tied such that it cannot now pass on the charge to tenants.  Therefore, the charge will be a charge on the local authority that will take the money from them.  On the one hand, some of the money will go to the local authorities but, on the other, it will be taken by the Government as there will be reduced funding.  With regard to local authority housing stock, where management cannot pass on the charge to the local authority tenants - it should not be passed on in any case - money will actually have to be given back to the State.  They will be at a net loss.  Could the Minister explain the position on this?<\/p><p> While the Minister is partially correct that the adaptation of a house could devalue it, particularly if kitchens, for example, are lowered for a wheelchair user, I know from experience of cases where adaptation was required for severely disabled or paralysed people.  I refer not only to adaptation but also to extensions.  An additional room, such as a bathroom, might have to be built on, or slopes or ramps may have to be created.  This costs money.  If we had time to tick-tack on this issue I believe the Minister would amend the legislation.  I do not believe it is his intention to have an impact on the people I describe.<\/p><p> I tabled my amendment to the original legislation.  I welcome the fact that the amended Bill goes a certain distance but if the Minister considers what he has done he will note that people who got grants to adapt their houses will have the value of the grant subtracted from the value of their property.  It will be of benefit.  However, people who did not get grants will be in different circumstances.  Let us consider the example of Joe and Mary.  Joe, who was unemployed and got a grant of &euro;10,000 to adapt his house under the housing adaptation grant scheme, will be able to subtract &euro;10,000 from the value of his house when calculating its value and pay the charge on the remainder.  Mary, who was working and did not get the adaptation grant because she was means tested, thus forcing her to pay the &euro;10,000 from her own pocket, will not have this sum subtracted from the value of her house.  Joe, who got the money from the State to carry out the adaptation, will have &euro;10,000 subtracted from the value of his house, whereas Mary, who did not get a cent from the State because she was means-tested, will not get anything.  It does not make sense.  This is a mistake either by the Minister's officials or himself and it should be corrected.  While I realise he will not address this now, I ask him to address it in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500057#EEE01700","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1362520800,"counter":736,"content":"<p>Before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners referred to houses at risk of flooding and, more specifically, to insurance cover.

The ground for each house is not prepared every second day; houses are built together.  All houses in affected estates will have received the same treatment, with the same stone.  The untreated houses have the same problems coming down the tracks as those already exposed as having pyrite.  Aside from the fact that under no circumstances could one dream of selling such a house, unless it is given a certificate proving beyond all doubt that it does not have pyrite, the chance that many of the houses have pyrite is great because the stone will have come from the same quarry and will have been used around the same time.  It is completely unfair on the owners.  The houses are houses that one would be hard set to give away, unlike the ones to which the Minister referred.  Selling a house in an estate where there is pyrite is just about impossible today.  I ask the Minister to consider the people caught in this dilemma.

I do not take on board the Minister's comment on the worth of houses because one can have a house that is worth nothing.  Would I, the Minister or any other Member want to buy a home in which somebody has died because of an extant problem with radon?  Those affected must pay money every year to try to keep the badness, the gas, at bay.  Nobody would want to live in such a house.  If I were given one for nothing, I would not want to take it.  I would not want anyone in my family to live in one, nor would the Minister or any other Member.<\/p><p>  What I propose is not opening the floodgates such that thousands of houses will be implicated.  Not many houses are affected by radon.  The Government should make the same exception for those affected as it made for those whose houses are affected by pyrite.

Just as Deputy Mick Wallace said pyrite is in the actual building, the Taoiseach said radon is coming from the ground up, thus making the circumstances different.  I put it to the Minister that it is all the same; if the house is bad, the house is bad, be it affected by pyrite or radon.

The Minister and I both know that not only is that not the case, the opposite is the case.  The councils do not pay more money to provide better services in areas where the house prices are higher.  The spend per person for Dublin City Council is less than anywhere else.

I rely on the technical information on housing from the Department and the note it provided on radon gas states that high radon levels in homes are easy to identify and, once identified, are relatively simple to fix.  The testing of houses for radon is relatively straightforward and non-invasive.  It is also inexpensive, with tests costing around &euro;56.  If the radon levels are found to be below the natural reference levels, no further action is necessary.  Where radon levels are found to be high, the installation of an active radon sump is the most common and effective remediation method in Ireland.  A sump can be installed within a day and with little disruption to the house as the work is carried out outside the house.  This method can reduce the highest radon concentrations typically by 90%.  An alternative approach is to increase indoor ventilation, which can reduce radon levels by up to 50%, thus being suitable for homes with up to twice the national reference level.<\/p><p>  The national radon control strategy for Ireland is the most appropriate way to address the issue of radon contamination and I do not feel it appropriate to provide exemptions from the local property tax to cater for this issue.  The local property tax is a self-assessment tax based on the market value of property.  In the first instance, it will be a matter for the liable person to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of property.  It is not similar to pyrite and according to the Department it can be remediated at very low cost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013030500059#GGG00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1362521400,"counter":751,"content":"<p>The Minister should tell the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that I have a letter on this topic from a man whose wife died because of radon in his house.

A test to establish the level of radon in a house can be done for &euro;56.  This is a different case from pyrite, and while there will be an exemption for homes affected by pyrite, there will be no exemption from radon.  Of course, if someone thinks the problem with radon has significantly reduced the value of his home, that will be reflected in the value he attributes to the house and if he puts a short note to that effect on the return, that will be taken into account.<\/p><p>  Deputy Fleming suggested householders will be deterred from building extensions because of the property tax but that will not be the case.  The initial valuation in 2013 will stand for three years so any extension built during that period will not lead to an increase in the payment in that time.  It is also unlikely the full cost of an extension would be added to the full market value of a property, even in the next valuation period of 2016 because extensions, as we know, do not always enhance the value of houses.  Frequently, they do not enhance by the amount the extension costs.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned the Revenue interfering in the by-election process.
