I am a full professor in the faculty of engineering and computing at DCU with a research focus on national energy systems decarbonisation in the context of the Paris Agreement.  My comments will primarily address national energy security but I will also relate this briefly to the other topics.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has suffered chronic energy insecurity virtually since the foundation of the State.  This arose due to the dominant role of fossil fuels in 20th century energy systems combined with Ireland's relatively small endowment of indigenous fossil fuel resources.  Our current energy system comprises three almost equal sectors - transport, heating and electricity.  Transport is dominated by the use of oil-based fuels, of which we have no indigenous sources.  This is mitigated to some extent by the maintenance of a substantial reserve through the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA.  Heating and electricity are both critically dependent on natural gas.  This is partially supplied from the indigenous Corrib field but that is declining quite rapidly and we have virtually no domestic natural gas storage.  Given the prospect of intensifying geopolitical instability, it is clear that Ireland has a compelling strategic need to address this situation of poor and deteriorating energy security.<\/p> <p>  Separate from this specific national situation, it is well understood that net global emissions of CO2 - arising primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels - must now fall to zero extremely rapidly.  Accordingly, urgent disruptive transformation of our energy system is required in any case.  The good news is that Ireland is exceptionally well endowed with indigenous zero-carbon energy sources in the forms of on and offshore wind and solar energy.  In principle, there is the opportunity to simultaneously address decarbonisation and energy security through replacing most, if not all, of our insecure supply of imported fossil energy with these secure indigenous sources.  Given the inherent variability of wind and solar, this will also require very large-scale deployment of green hydrogen production and storage.  All of this is technically feasible, although it will require decisive policy measures to bring about.<\/p> <p>  The bad news is that due to prolonged procrastination and the effective denial of the climate crisis, the time now available for this transformation is extremely limited.  The scale of the challenge is likely to come sharply into focus when the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, publishes its proposals for the first carbon budget programme covering the period from 2021 to 2035.  Without prejudice to such detailed analysis as may be provided by the council, our research at DCU strongly indicates that we will need radical action over that period on both supply and demand sides.  Even with the most rapid conceivable build out of zero-carbon energy supply, it will also be essential to minimise society-wide energy demand for at least the next two decades.  Of course, this must be done on a basis of equity, solidarity and the prevention of energy poverty.<\/p><p>To turn to the question of LNG, it has been suggested that, given the reality of our deepening exposure to disruption to natural gas supplies through our pipeline connections to the UK, the construction of LNG import terminals may represent a prudent diversification of supply routes.  This argument is flawed on multiple grounds, including the risk that locking in additional natural gas supply will conflict with the speed with which we now need to exit its use; the risks associated with upstream release of methane in LNG production, especially via fracking; and the essential global need to reserve &quot;embodied emissions space&quot; for the building of zero carbon energy infrastructure.<br\/><br\/>In relation to data centres, I have already emphasised the need to minimise national energy use over at least the next 20 years.  In that light, combining effective climate action with continued rapid expansion of a sector that relies<i><\/i>on additional energy consumption is akin to trying to run down an up-escalator.  We are constantly being pushed off track.  Given the related, very near-term impact on the stability of the electricity grid, I consider that there is a strong argument for an immediate moratorium on such expansion, at least pending full and detailed assessment of the actions which will be required to meet the carbon budget constraint for 2021 to 2024, the first carbon budget period.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the energy charter treaty, I simply endorse and echo the evidence already given to the committee by Dr. Tienhaara of Queen's University, Ontario, Canada, specifically the recommendation to support a co-ordinated EU exit from the treaty.  Finally, I provided a selection of documents addressing more specific aspects of the points made above.

It is a separate discussion.  The instability in the grid that EirGrid is warning about this coming winter, and potentially for successive winters for several years, arises not from a shortfall in the supply of natural gas <i>per se<\/i>, but from a shortfall in firm generation capacity, which is capacity that can be dispatched on demand.  The issue we face on the grid currently is a potential shortfall in firm generation capacity, which, if combined with poor weather conditions for wind and solar in the middle of winter when normal demand is high anyway, would risk an electricity generation shortfall.  This would not be because of a shortage of natural gas, but simply because we do not have enough firm generation capacity.  That could lead to unplanned or forced electricity blackouts, which would be a bad thing.  Nobody would want that to happen.  Obviously, therefore, the greater the peak demand is in the coming few winter seasons, the greater the risk that this sort of combination of circumstances could come about.  Adding natural gas terminals does not change that <i>per se<\/i>.  As I said, there is no immediate risk to supply though the UK and we have adequate pipeline connections to the UK to ensure that if we had the generation capacity, we would meet electricity demand.<br\/><br\/>Although properly speaking, this should not yield an argument for deployment of LNG, there is a tenuous connection in that the longer we continue this critical reliance on natural gas, especially as the Corrib field depletes, the more exposed we become to potential geopolitical disruption of gas supplies.  It is not directly linked to the danger of blackouts <i>per se<\/i>, but it is true that the more electricity we use, the quicker we use it.  That is to say, the more electricity demand outpaces the build-out of renewable supply in wind and solar, and especially the build-out of storage which allows us to dispatch or move around wind and solar energy in time, the more exposed we become to geopolitical disruption in gas supply.  In turn, that might strengthen the argument for LNG.  I still think that is a bad path to go down, but that is a separate discussion.<br\/><br\/>My apologies but I have forgotten the end of the Deputy's second question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I was referring to the intent of a Bill, which has been debated on Second Stage, to place a clear restriction on all planning authorities in relation to the building of new, or expansion of existing, fossil fuel infrastructure and data centres during the period of a climate emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#B00500","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Combining all fossil fuel infrastructure with data centres may be slightly blunt.

I am trying to get a handle on the difference between Professor McMullin's advice and other advice.  Am I right in saying that Professor McMullin has quoted someone arguing that energy security cannot be a defence for prolonging CO2 emissions?  That seems to be leading the professor to the suggestion that we should not be putting in any new gas or fossil fuel infrastructure.  The counterargument that we hear from other witnesses is that this risks blackout and that we need gas as a transition fuel as we move from a system that is predominantly fossil fuel-based to one that is predominantly renewables-based.  I wish to probe Professor McMullin's view on that.<\/p> <p>  I do not quite understand Professor McMullin's argument for a moratorium on one particular source of energy demand, namely, data centres, and not on other sources of demand.  How does he establish the national priorities of one versus the other?  Demand management in total seems to be a most important tool but it would be a rather blunt measure to pick one source of demand and put a moratorium on it, while treating others in a different way without an apparent economic, social or any other model underpinning it.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is whether LNG offers some security for a system that is going to be gas-dependent, at least in the medium term.<\/p><p>As I understand it, Professor McMullin's argument is that LNG in some cases, namely, fracked sources of gas, adds methane.  Nevertheless, that is surely on the inventory of other countries which, under the Paris Agreement, are obliged to take that into account and mitigate it in the commitments they make under that agreement.  Is it a concern for Ireland, therefore, as to where our LNG comes from and whether some element of it comes from fracked sources?  That is a matter for the countries that permit that.  We do not permit it.  I would like some clarity on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#B00700","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>They were excellent questions.  As for ruling out all new fossil fuel infrastructure, I would argue for a more nuanced view.  There can be legitimate cases for some further development of fossil fuel infrastructure in the short term, particularly in respect of some potentially gas-fired electricity generation and natural gas storage.  When I say \"gas\", for the moment I am talking about natural gas.  Natural gas storage development also provides diversity in supply and some insurance hedging against disruption of natural gas supply.  That is in preference, in my view, to LNG terminals, particularly because natural gas storage facilities carry with them the possibility for migration to hydrogen storage.   Rather than something that is basically a road leading nowhere, investing in something we would have to abandon, namely, LNG import infrastructure, natural gas storage infrastructure can migrate to hydrogen storage in general.<\/p> <p>  I am not ruling out any investment in fossil fuel infrastructure but, at the current time, pending the review of energy security that the Deputy initiated, and most especially pending the carbon budget programme for the next 15 years, we really cannot make any informed judgment about particular fossil fuel infrastructural developments.  We need to prioritise getting those matters in place and, in the meantime, not making things worse or prejudicing the sorts of actions we may need in the light of the carbon budget constraints.<\/p> <p>   As to why I am focusing specifically on not expanding energy use from data centres rather than other potential industry developments that would involve large additional energy use, in recent years they have contributed disproportionately to Ireland's overall total energy use.  In the projections to 2030, this is even more stark.  I fully agree with the Deputy that in an ideal world, one would not bluntly look at one particular sector of large energy use and would have something more sophisticated than that, but it is characteristic of emergency-type situations that we sometimes have to be more pragmatic than that.  This large sector is clearly identifiable as a distinct sector and it is growing at a completely disproportionate rate.  It is growing energy use in the national territory at a rate much greater than that of any other identifiable sector.  it is amenable to targeted action, because it is identifiable and distinct, and it can be prioritised because, scale wise, it is very large.  In an ideal world, there are many things we would do differently but, to be pragmatic about it, in regard to managing the growth and total energy use, targeting the data centre sector in particular is entirely defensible.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about LNG and whether, if methane leakage is associated with fracked natural gas expansion and-or the processing of gas into liquid form and the processing back to gaseous form, that is, local degasification, we should simply say the upstream methane outside the national territory is someone else's problem, since it would be off the national inventory.  He went on to argue our energy security trumps that.  I can see where he is coming from.  The existing structure of territorial emissions accounting has problems; it is not ideal.  I do not think anyone working in this area would advocate an exclusive focus on territorial accounting but it forms the basis for the multilateral co-ordination under the Paris Agreement, so it is very important.  That said, we all have an obligation not to make things more difficult for other parties to the Paris Agreement if we can help it.  Choosing to pursue a path we know will present more difficult challenges for other parties to the agreement is not really a great way of trying to encourage multilateral co-ordination and co-operation.  Ireland is a small player, globally.  We are completely dependent on our ability to persuade other, much larger parties to take much stronger action, but we have to be very careful-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMullin.

At the moment, that is not too big a problem, given that a large proportion of our electricity is still coming from other sources and the vast majority of our heating and transport energy comes from other sources.  That is not too big a problem right now, but as we try to build out as fast as possible to get rid of those fuels from our system, we will reach the point where it is essential to be able to move that energy around in time at a very large scale.  The biggest storage facility on the island is the Turlough Hill pumped-storage hydro station, which has a capacity - I apologise for the technical numbers - of about 2 GWh of storage.  We need terawatt hour-scale storage to successfully deploy, year round, 70%, 80% or 90% of our energy from variable renewables.  That is 1,000 times larger.  We are not going to do that with pumped hydro.  The only practical way of achieving that kind of scale of energy storage is with chemical forms of energy.  The starter for all chemical forms of energy, if we are starting with electricity, is hydrogen.<\/p><p>Hydrogen storage would be the first preferred option.  Hydrogen can be stored in very large quantities but the best option for doing that is in so-called salt-cavern geological formations, and on the island of Ireland they only exist in Northern Ireland.  There is a project already under way looking at natural gas storage with a possible migration route to hydrogen storage there.  On an all-island basis, that should be a high priority for moving along as quickly as possible and understanding what are the limits and what is the capacity there - whether we can reach terawatt hour scale or whether that will not hack it for terrawatt hour scale.  Clarifying that would be really important.<\/p><p> The other technology needed is electrolyzers to convert electricity into hydrogen and generators to convert hydrogen back into electricity.  One would not use all electricity back in hydrogen but would use some directly in heating and in transport.<\/p><p> Of those technologies, electrolyzer technology is developing very rapidly.  It is certainly ready for medium-scale buildout already but it would need incentive schemes to make it work.  It would need something like the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction-type process to get much faster buildout of electrolyzer capacity.  Similarly, gas turbines for electricity generation are already available in similar scales to natural gas for using hydrogen instead of natural gas but it would require explicit structured incentive schemes to ensure that any new construction of gas-fired generation was capable of migrating to hydrogen combustion.<\/p><p> Those technologies are there.  We are much more exposed and reliant on them than many other countries but, conversely, that is an opportunity for us to push the technology profile.  However, it would require, as I say, things like auctions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMullin.

I believe the Minister is quite clear on seeking and having an end now to LNG and it is important to look at what the international situation is.  Second, what kind of energy loss is there as we send energy from one side of the country to the other because the fact that we have large users around the capital and fewer on the west coast has been identified as an issue for us?  Third, in relation to EirGrid and the supply of power to new industry or new service providers, my understanding is that they would alert EirGrid and EirGrid would make an offer with terms and conditions attached.

I might have to follow up with more detail on some of these.  I do not have data to hand on the UK LNG capacity.  I note the UK pipeline capacity has been reduced recently due to one pipeline being out of action and that has translated into some restriction on supply all the way through to Ireland.  In terms of LNG capacity in the UK, I do not have up-to-date figures but I can look those up.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transmissions losses, the system operator tries to manage the buildout of new transmission capacity to ensure losses are kept within certain limits - the exact numbers can be provided by them later on - but we need to be honest with citizens that a future that involves electrification of heat and transport, quite independently of data centres, will require more transmission infrastructure in order to keep those losses down to management levels.  That means more transmission lines, more pylons, more transformer stations.  Those are essential to this energy transition and I am not sure that is yet generally understood.<\/p> <p>  On terms and conditions for large energy users' new connections to the grid, I would not want to pre-empt the system operator, EirGrid, who are the experts in this, but, in terms of conditions for systems stability, these are ensuring that they have their own peak generation capability.  I would prefer to see that peak generation capability being progressively required to be in the form of on-site hydrogen storage where the hydrogen is generated - it is green hydrogen - and we start scaling that up over a short number of years.  We need, however, to build that in so that their backup generation, which is really system support generation at this stage if it is on-call to the system operator, would be constrained to be zero carbon which, effectively, would mean it has to be green hydrogen at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMullin for his presentation.

There was a motion for a moratorium on the permissions and it was notable the lack of any discussion about putting any controls or demand management systems in place for large energy users.  My fear is that when there is demand management, it tends to be more towards individuals and the State will require a lot of individuals and families when it comes to demand management which will be quite costly for them.

I will try to be brief.  To clarify, demand management is used in two quite different senses.  There is a technical sense that one will hear the system operator, EirGrid, use in terms of demand management.  That is about moving energy demand around within, say, a 12-to-24 hour period.  It is not reducing the total amount of energy used.  It is changing somewhat, within a few hours, when exactly it is used.  That is important for managing the peak demand but it is almost irrelevant to emissions.  That form of demand management is not what I have been talking about.  I have been talking about managing the total annual energy demand that we have quite independently of that sort of short-term shifting of demand in time by a few hours.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Whitmore.

That is a way of trying to balance the effective rationing of emissions across individuals, corporations and wider society.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the data centres or the large energy users that have already been built out, I am not a lawyer and I will not pretend to advise on legal exposure to the State depending what measures it might adopt.<\/p><p>Again, the technical system I mentioned would, as the emissions cap was reduced, require that those corporate entities with large emissions footprints would have to take progressively stronger and more expensive actions to mitigate it.  They would either successfully mitigate it or decide the activity was no longer worth it or profitable and would stop doing it.  That might lead to reductions for that reason.  That would be appropriate.  That would be the economics of carbon pricing as opposed to carbon taxing doing what it says on the tin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Professor McMullin.

Much depends on how quickly we think this decarbonisation transition has to happen.  If we think it is 30, 40 or 50 years then we have many more options on the table.  We are awaiting the CCAC's advice on budgets but the carbon emissions budget numbers we have looked at suggest we do not have anything like 30, 40 or 50 years.  We have 15 to 20 years if we are going to do our fair part on a global basis.  If we do not do our fair part on a global basis our opportunity to influence the big emitting parties will be greatly reduced.  If that is the time we have then in our context, where we have large indigenous resources of variable renewables, green hydrogen looms large.  I should emphasise that green hydrogen is what I am speaking about when I say \"hydrogen\".  There is a lot of activity in Europe on hydrogen generally and some activity on green hydrogen.  In Europe and the world, Ireland has an almost unique need to push green hydrogen development as fast as it can go.  If we do this, we will have the opportunity to lead in the technology development and even export the expertise we gain in doing so.  Rapidly developing this hydrogen strategy in the light of carbon budgets as part of the climate action plan will be important over the next year.<\/p> <p>  The CRU operates on a statutory mandate.  It is doing what it has a statutory mandate to do.  The statutory mandate is to manage the monopoly providers of electricity and gas infrastructure to satisfy demand at least cost.  It is not its fault that this is its remit.  My point of view is that as a society we need to discuss our priorities.  We throw around phrases such as \"climate emergency\" and \"climate crisis\".  I am not sure we have internalised them.  We spent 30 years basically saying climate action is important and as long as the economy is going well, we will work on climate.  I am afraid we have run out of road on this.  We now have to flip it and say we have to achieve our climate targets.  We will keep a strong as possible an economy within this limit but the first question every year should not be whether the economy is growing but whether our emissions are falling at the level required.  As long as the answer is \"Yes\" then all other economic choices are open.  This can only happen if there is wider societal buy-in to the idea.  In my view, this deep into the climate crisis we do not have a good way forward unless we can reorient our priorities.  We must remember that gross economic activity is a poor indicator of societal well-being.  Prioritising other things rather than just having more and more economic activity for economic activity's sake should not automatically be threatening.  I will stop there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I am in the building.

If we build it, it will run.  It will not run for zero times.  I know people say it will only run very little but there will be more emissions than there would have been had those data centres not been built and built corresponding fossil fuel infrastructure to be able to meet peak demand.  The emissions would definitely be higher in that situation.

To what extent has the modelling we have had on emergency scenarios been focusing on emergency supply issues rather than emergency modelling on demand and demand reduction?

There is the idea of the precautionary principle and being able to model demand reduction.  What Professor McMullin pointed out was strong with regard to there not being space.  The space we have in embodied energy needs to be going towards either resilience or transition rather than to expansion.

Modelling the interaction between demand and demand constraint, not demand management in the sense of short-term demand management but managing down the overall amount of electricity demand, traditionally is not something that EirGrid or the CRU has been mandated to do, although I think that mandate could change to reflect precisely the precautionary principle.  We need a lot of confidence on emissions actually going down and going down quickly.<\/p><p> On the Energy Charter Treaty, I completely agree with the Senator in regard to LNG terminals.  Again, I am not a lawyer so I do not want to go too far down that road but, from what I understand, there is certainly a potential exposure there.

I am the chairperson of the CRU and I am joined by my fellow commissioners: Dr. Paul McGowan and Mr. Jim Gannon.  The CRU is Ireland&rsquo;s independent water and energy regulator.  Our mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  A core element of our vision is ensuring a secure, low-carbon future.<\/p> <p>  We have circulated to the committee the recently published CRU information paper, which outlines security-of-supply challenges identified in the latest generation capacity statement 2021, along with the programme of work that the commission is undertaking to address these challenges.<\/p> <p>  The core element of the programme is the procurement of 2,000 MW of new enduring, flexible gas-fired generation that will facilitate the integration of further renewables and support the transition.  We are also taking temporary and contingency measures in the interim.  These include delivering 300 MW of temporary emergency generation, enhanced demand-side response and the retention for a short period of existing generators which were otherwise expected to retire.<\/p> <p>  These measures have been developed with EirGrid, our transmission system operator, and will be delivered with EirGrid, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and other key stakeholders.  The measures outlined will be delivered through either competitive markets or through competitive procurement to achieve cost-effective delivery.<\/p> <p>  The CRU is fully committed to Ireland&rsquo;s low-carbon transition, represented by our 2030 targets and our recently adopted Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act.  While we would clearly prefer not to retain some of the higher-emitting generators, we consider this necessary to ensure security of supply.  Priority dispatch for renewable generation and higher carbon prices should ensure that these generators will only run when absolutely needed.  Their use will also be reduced by increasing renewable capacity on the system and the delivery of the DS3 project which will increase the level of renewables that can be accommodated instantaneously from 70% to 75% and more.<\/p> <p>  Further CRU work that is under way to support the secure transition and deliver our 2030 targets includes delivering the regulatory frameworks to support the new interconnectors, Greenlink and Celtic; supporting the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions, including offshore RESS and developing a new framework for offshore grid development; developing the new competitive framework for system services to support best-in-class delivery of 95% instantaneous penetration of renewables; building on the suite of smart services, enabled by smart meters, which allow customers to participate in energy markets, while saving on their bills, including the framework for the clean export guarantee for renewable self-generators; and ensuring our electricity and gas network companies support security of supply and decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>  Regarding gas security, as Ireland progresses with an electricity system of high renewables, backed up by flexible gas-fired generation, along with the electrification of heating and transport, the security of natural gas supply is of increasing strategic national importance.  Gas, and in the future decarbonised gases, will form part of the decarbonisation agenda in decades to come.<\/p> <p>  The recent closure of the Kinsale gas storage facility and the ongoing decline of Corrib gas production will leave Ireland dependent on a single supply source, via our interconnectors with the UK, for 90% of our gas supplies by 2030.  This means that we will not meet the N-1 security standard.  Ireland would not have the capacity to satisfy our total gas demand in the event of disruption to the single largest gas infrastructure during a day of high demand.  The diversification of gas supply sources, through new types of gas as well as new supply routes, would, therefore, significantly enhance the security of supply of Ireland&rsquo;s energy sector as a whole, as well as delivering cross-sectoral benefits.<\/p> <p>  On the basis that there is a ban on new indigenous exploration authorisations and in the absence of viable options for further gas interconnection, we consider it prudent that the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications review of energy security should include an examination of the future role of LNG.  We look forward to the outcome of this review.<\/p> <p>  Electricity demand growth from this data centres is unlike anything Ireland has seen in the past 100 years.  At present, this demand is connecting to the grid more quickly and easily than it has proven possible to deliver the supporting transmission and generation infrastructure.  As independent regulator, the CRU has, therefore, consulted on a draft direction on new data centre connection policy, which seeks to mitigate some of the security-of-supply risk associated with the growth of data centre demand.  We are still deliberating and we will make our decision in October.  Our aim is to ensure that data centres are part of the solution to the challenge they present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Chairman and members of the committee; it is an honour to be here.  I am joined by Ms Suzanne Collins, our head of public relations; and Mr. Rodney Doyle, our chief operations officer.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that we have been asked to appear before the committee to discuss some topics of current public interest relating to the power system, and I will address these matters directly in our submission.  First, I wish to provide a short reminder of what EirGrid does and what we are about.  We operate the power system on a 24-7 basis across two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, thus ensuring people have safe and secure electricity at all times, supporting social and economic growth.  We are also responsible for planning the power system of the future, much of which is set out in EirGrid&rsquo;s strategy, which was launched in two years ago and which underpins the Government&rsquo;s decarbonisation ambition for the electricity system as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2019 and the forthcoming climate action plan which is imminent.<\/p> <p>  Our strategy has five key objectives.  The first is to connect to new renewables.  We expect to connect approximately 10,000 MW of renewables in the next decade, predominantly onshore wind and solar power, and a new generation of offshore wind predominantly from the Irish Sea.  We currently have approximately 4,500 MW of renewables on the Irish system.<\/p> <p>  Second, we must upgrade the network across the country to handle more renewables as well as greater demand for electricity.  This means more wires, more pylons and substations and the deployment of new technology on the wires.  Recent decisions by EirGrid to place major elements of the new network underground supported by significant public feedback on the matter will support the deliverability of these new projects.<\/p> <p>  Third, we must engineer solutions that will allow the power system to function in a stable manner at approximately 95% renewables, on an instantaneous basis, if we are to achieve the Government target of 70% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  I note the NDP publication yesterday, which has set the target of 80% of electricity from renewables in 2030.<\/p><p>Last April we reported that Ireland received 43% of all electricity from renewable sources in 2020, which is an extraordinary achievement and world-leading.  We look forward to pushing the boundaries in the next decade.<br\/><br\/>Fourth, we must become more interconnected with Europe, particularly, but not exclusively, in a post-Brexit world.  In this regard, we must deliver the proposed 700 MW Celtic interconnector between Ireland and France by the middle of this decade.  We welcome and support the private sector proposition for the Greenlink project, a 500 MW link between Ireland and Great Britain due for commissioning in 2024.<br\/><br\/>Finally, and very importantly, the market is important to delivering the full holistic solution and must be incentivised to deliver the relevant solutions, including technology, services, etc., on time and at the right price point to support the decarbonisation agenda.  We remain on track to deliver these five strategic goals, notwithstanding the challenges in front of us.<br\/><br\/>I will talk about demand, which has been one of the most topical points in the recent past.  I refer members to our generation capacity statement, published last week.  We publish this document annually for the benefit of government, regulators and the industry at large.  We endeavour to provide a coherent and transparent future-looking assessment of electricity demand in Ireland.  The statement involves a detailed process, taking the best part of 12 months, and speaks to the demand that is required, renewables, conventional plant, where the demand will come from, generation and adequacy, which is the gap between generation and demand.  We try to articulate what that gap is and suggest where solutions might best be delivered.  <br\/><br\/>Every year since 2016, EirGrid&rsquo;s generation capacity statement has flagged that, in our economy and as a function of the success of the economy, there has been growing demand for electricity.  This creates challenges, particularly from the industrial sector.  In 2019 and 2020, the generation capacity statements also flagged our concerns about the declining availability of the old generation fleet, which has served us well in recent decades.  It is ageing and carbon-intensive and we need to think about plans to see it off the system.  This information and data provide the regulator, who is responsible for security of supply, and market participants with a singular view of the demand and supply equation which is designed to inform decisions about what new generation is required and when it is required.  <br\/><br\/>The key messages coming from the generation capacity statement last week are as follows.  Demand for electricity will grow significantly over the next decade, driven by strong economic growth, which is good for all; significant increases in industrial demand, particularly data centres; the electrification of transport, involving electric vehicles; and the heating of homes.  The demand increase is likely to be in the region of 28% over the decade with the potential for a greater increase, depending on the pace of growth in each of the areas mentioned.  We believe it is prudent to plan on the basis of a 28% to 30% increase as a minimum and have appropriate contingency baked into the plan in case those limits are exceeded.<br\/><br\/>Covid has negatively impacted our capacity to deliver infrastructure and secure outages, not only for vital maintenance and upgrades on transmission lines, but also for generation plants where it was not possible to get technicians in from countries outside Ireland.  Key specialised personnel could not travel and there is a backlog of work we have to factor into our planning over the coming years.<br\/><br\/>The generation capacity statement is clear in its messages and I want to be clear for members of the committee.  Our power system requires approximately 2,000 MW of low-carbon, flexible, dispatchable gas generation over the next ten years to meet demand and, critically, support the transition to a low-carbon power system, which is our collective ambition, up to 2030 initially and ultimately to a zero-carbon power system.  These ambitions are set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which was recently enacted.  In the medium term, this 2,000 MW will be based on gas.  There is no alternative reliable, conventional fuel.  It is low carbon and we believe this technology is ultimately capable of migrating and transitioning to a zero-carbon proposition.<br\/><br\/>It is critical that the procurement of this 2,000 MW is executed with speed through the forthcoming auction process the regulator has designed and that we avoid a protracted period of dependency on high fossil fuel content and on old and less reliable generation plant.  For the moment, we need to keep this old plant going until we have alternative capacity.  The near and medium-term solution, to 2024 or 2025, includes the procurement, unfortunately, of temporary generation sets to allow us to protect security supply and, critically, do essential maintenance on transmission lines and generation plant.<br\/><br\/>To address the current situation, some of the older plants on the system have had reliability problems, not helped by the fact that Covid-19 has prevented repair works, etc.  As these plants return, with appropriate repairs, their margins will improve.  I reassure members that when those works are done we will have a secure and reliable system.  There should be less concern than has been evinced in some of the press reports we have read recently.<br\/><br\/>We are pleased that the two plants we lost as a result of exceptional and unusual outages in Huntstown and Whitegate have secured the necessary parts and equipment.  Those parts are in Ireland and we expect to have the plants back very shortly.  To summarise the outlook for the coming winter, with those plants returning and with winter being a time when we expect to have high levels of wind in the system, there are limited grounds for concern.  We expect to have a secure supply over the winter and, unless something exceptional occurs, people can sleep in their beds at night and be satisfied they will have electricity<b>. <\/b><br\/><br\/>I will speak on the subject of data centres because it is incredibly topical and has been the subject of some comments that are not helpful, including one this week which referred to data centres accounting for 70% of demand on the power system by 2030.  This is not a factual statement and does not help the conversation.  First, we should acknowledge that data centres have made a massive contribution, as has the ICT sector in general, to the social experiment which has seen 2 million people working from home over the past 18 months.  Business, industry and commerce are dependent on data.  The collapse of the experience sector was not replicated across the rest of the economy, thanks to the fact we could all work from home.  Data centres are, therefore, a critical part of the economic and social fabric of 21st-century living.<br\/><br\/>Second, Ireland is a world player in this space and the true value to the economy of data centres is well documented by IDA Ireland.  Third, a significant amount of Ireland&rsquo;s forecasted growth for electricity will come from data centres.  However, the figure is more in the order of 30% than the mistaken 70% figure cited earlier in the week.  EirGrid understands that such growth in demand must and can be accommodated by an appropriate policy framework which seeks to ensure that all parties collaborate on an approach that responds to the temporary constraints in the current system.  These constraints can be resolved on an enduring basis over the next decade.  The CRU&rsquo;s current proposed policy framework is an appropriate response for the short to medium term.  I hope the sector will look favourably on this proposal and work with us on delivering projects and working in collaboration with the transmission system operator.<br\/><br\/>I will summarise EirGrid&rsquo;s position.  Collectively, we must remain focused on the objective of decarbonising the power system as a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, notwithstanding the near-term challenges I have spoken to and which have been much spoken about over the summer.  People need to be reassured that the near-term challenges will be dealt with.  In addition, the delivery of a green power system is an imperative.  It will also be a source of competitive advantage for our economy in the next decade, if delivered in a cost-effective and expeditious manner.  In March 2021, EirGrid launched a wide-ranging public consultation on how to shape our electricity future.<\/p><p>The roadmap arising from this 14-week consultation will be published shortly.  It will provide clarity and transparency on what needs to be done in terms of where demand and generation should be located to allow us achieve the 2030 objectives.  In the interim, our generation capacity statement speaks to near-term issues and what needs to be done.  We have a plan agreed with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the regulators.

Was there a failure to understand the growth in demand?  Were there other reasons going back to 2018, 2019 or 2020, which the CRU rightly or wrongly did not factor in or perhaps unexpected things happening?

There are two factors relating to capacity procured by the capacity remuneration mechanism that have led in the past 12 months to the capacity challenge in the coming years.  The first is that a tranche of approximately 500 MW of previously secured and procured capacity will not now be delivered.  That poses a challenge for us in the capacity years 2022-23, 2023-24 and ongoing.  That is capacity that was procured by the mechanism but will now no longer deliver.  In the same timeframe, as it happens, there will be approximately 700 MW of gas-fired capacity, which has been procured and which will be deliver.  There is not as much delivery as we would like but there was a mixed experience by the developers who were successful in that specific auction.  The most recent auction which targeted the capacity year 2024-2025, that is, the winter straddling the calendar years of 2024 and 2025, it cleared all the capacity that came to the auction but there was a low appetite from industry to come to that auction.  What we have done during the past year, following the results of that auction and experiences of some dropout in capacity, is explored with the developers the delivery risks that have been challenging them and tried to understand some of the economic perspectives those developers have to bring those to bear on the critical forthcoming two auctions, one of which is a three-year auction, which targets that same winter of 2024-25, and the subsequent auction, which targets the winter of 2025-2026.  Those are two auctions in the first quarter of next year to do that.  With our colleagues on the single electricity market committee, we are taking feedback from industry to understand what those challenges might be.<\/p> <p>  For our part, as CRU in our jurisdiction, we have picked up on certain aspects and we have acted on them .  Recently we issued a direction to the system operators for electricity - EirGrid and the ESB.  That has prioritised grid connection for gas-fired capacity successful in those auctions.  In effect, it has to expedited, prioritised and reduced risk that generators might perceive to their timeline.  We have also issued a similar direction to Gas Networks Ireland.  That allows it to consider advanced or anticipatory investment to make sure that should these projects come to the table and require gas, there is sufficient headroom and reinforcements in place.  It allows for the commencement of some of the anticipatory work, anticipating these projects will come to the system.  In many cases, this is work that is required regardless of what facility or generator specifically may win.<\/p> <p>  Separately, again with the same committee, we examined the parameters of each auction and in those we considered some quite complex economic parameters but also the fundamental parameter, which is a signal on volume.  Critically, and we would have stated this at our previous appearance before the committee, the generator cohort is aware of the capacity challenge we have, which as Mr. Foley indicated, and has been stated in the recent national development plan, is approximately 2,000 MW of gas capacity to complement wind and to allow wind on to our system safely in order for us to reach our 2030 targets.  There is a clear signal there.  What the generation capacity statement, GCS, has done in recent weeks is to state to industry that we need to advance some of that investment earlier than we would have anticipated for some of the reasons we have outlined.  These are signals that we send to the markets.  In addition, in the auctions which are out for consultation, specific parameters are now being set for those two auctions in the first quarter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gannon for his response.

There is a combination of flexible gas to be used when required.  They involve storage, both battery and other longer-term storage, and, separately, system services that provide stability to the grid.  Effectively, they manage power quality as we let more wind on to the system as we respond to changes in that profile of generation and demand specifically.  These are well understood technologies.  It is now a matter of sending the approximate economic signal to the market, thereby derisking certain processes.  Part of that dialogue would be around the planning, environmental licensing and other ancillary processes relating to support infrastructure, for example, for water supply where required, and the policy signal, which is quite important to many developers whose overarching boards have environmental, social and governance, ESG, requirements.  Where we are requesting that participants provide us with flexible gas supply, many now see that as aligned with our climate ambitions and our obligations under the legally binding climate Act, but also allowing us to consider a decarbonisation pathway for that gas.  That is quite important.  We are not just asking them to invest in a nine-year perspective that we will need gas until 2030 but that it is considered as necessary beyond that and that it becomes part of a decarbonisation pathway for that gas, involving perhaps green gas and, particularly for Ireland in terms of a long-term economic opportunity powered to gas, the use of hydrogen and those technologies as the technology becomes mature and comes down the cost curve, which would provide Ireland with the best opportunity to create national wealth from the natural resource we have blessed with given our geographic position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Gannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gannon for that response.

I want to focus on the question of demand.  EirGrid's presentation was interesting in highlighting the sequencing is that demand is what is required as the first point and then the generation that will meet the demand.<\/p><p>In respect of data centres, Mr. Foley later stated that the growth in demand needs to be, and can be, accommodated.  My concern is that the immutable piece seems to be demand whereas the policy seems to relate to supply.  We have seen statements on a continued reliance on gas and a potential delay in the exit from certain other forms of fossil fuels.<br\/><br\/>Last year and before the summer we previously discussed the issue of demand reduction with EirGrid.  I ask about the modelling for demand.  The previous witness put it very well.  It is not that we have an economy and are seeking to make that economy more environmentally sustainable.  We are now working within environmental and planetary limits, and economic activity needs to take place within that constraint.  However, the statement seems to be very focused on the fact that the demand must grow.  There is a detailed economic discussion about data centres but not much detail on the environmental piece.  <br\/><br\/>What measures are being taken in terms of modelling?  Risk was mentioned as well as derisking for businesses.  What other risk analysis has been done for the State?  What is the risk analysis and what has been the demand modelling both in terms of energy alerts and blackouts which is one form of demand management, but also in the medium term in terms of demand management measures?  What are the measures if we do not have flexibility in supply?  If we are tied to the 80% or if it becomes a requirement for 90% by 2030, has that been modelled?<br\/><br\/>This issue applies to the CRU also.  Under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the CRU is required to ensure environmentally sustainable energy supply.  Under section 9(5)(<i>a<\/i>) the Electricity Regulation Act, the CRU has a duty to take account of protection of the environment and give priority to renewable and sustainable energy sources.  In that context, if we assume that supply is not as negotiable and that we are looking to hard targets on the environment, how do we model demand?  It was mentioned that there should be policy frameworks for data centres.  Should those policy frameworks not be in place before the CRU commits us to further connections, involving further planning permissions?  What risk analysis has it done in terms of the Energy Charter Treaty given the difficulty of moving away if we install from fossil fuel infrastructure?  That is also a concern when we see things like the LNG being proposed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#J00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I will answer the question in three parts.  First, demand is increasing; there is no question about that.  That demand is a function of two things.  One is a very successful economy, which is good for the whole nation, and second is a digital economy that is world class.  That is a fact and we need to consider how we cater for that.  There are two other parts of the equation I really want the Senator to understand.<\/p> <p>  Second, there is major emphasis, involving major measures and programmes with people in industry and elsewhere, about demand reduction and demand moderation.  We talk about DSUs and others where people are incentivised to be available to switch their electricity off at times of peak demand and to be able to contribute to the sustainable growth of the electricity system.  This is a second and crucial part of the three pillars which makes the power system function and ultimately allows us to have a sustainable system.<\/p> <p>  Third, and importantly, is the deployment of intelligence in the power system.  This is between EirGrid and the distribution system operator, ESB Networks, with the recent and rapid deployment of smart meters.  We will not see peak demand growing in proportion to total demand because we will have the widespread deployment of very smart intelligent devices on the system.  As houses get heated by electricity and as cars get charged by electricity, there would be considerable activity outside peak times when prices are low and at times when the power system is operating at close to 100% renewables.  It is important for the committee members to understand that this is not just about meeting unbridled demand, but is about an holistic set of measures, which include technology and engagement with market participants who are available and willing to moderate their demand while being commercially and appropriately remunerated for that.

Therefore, we already have schemes in place to allow us to that, working with the large-demand customers.<\/p> <p>  We have a very active demand side unit participation in our electricity market.

With regard to demand side units, even at the start of September we saw a significantly tight period.  At that point, wind was giving us very low electricity.  Demand side units were asked to become active and they did.  They can respond and they can make a material difference there.  On the single electricity market committee, we work together with our colleagues from the Northern Ireland utilities regulator on the wholesale market.  We had a consultation run during the summer months to explore how we could bring more demand side units to the table and incentivise them such that they are made more available.  This is particularly focused at those peak points in time.<\/p><p>That does not quite respond to the question from Deputy Higgins around the longer-term demand profiling, admittedly, but a written response from EirGrid in the first instance would be well worth considering.<\/p><p> On the question of our response to data centres, there has been a policy in place for a couple of years on data centre connections.  In recent times we had a subsequent consultation to see if more were needed, given EirGrid's more long-term modelling.  It was in the form of a proposed decision, which had a number of options.  One was a blanket moratorium, which is a tool that remains open to regulators if required at any point.  The preferred option was to explore with the data centre community the choices to sufficiently mitigate the challenge they pose to us through a range of different technologies, restrictions or even opportunities that could be afforded to that community.  It is notable we had over 50 responses to that consultation and we expect to come to a final decision in the next four to five weeks.  We would be very happy to forward that to the committee on its publication and have subsequent dialogue on it.<\/p><p> There is a mixed perspective in the data centre community; some of them find it more difficult to be more flexible in their demand or approach and some are quite ambitious and are seeking to look at the long term, recognising Ireland's opportunity and the foundation that a highly renewable system has already given them to support their electricity supply generation goals and differentiate themselves from their competitors.  Some of these businesses are looking at the sort of long-term battery storage that could take advantage of excess wind at those points in time and use it when needed.  Separately, they also want to look at on-site generation not only with regard to the use of natural gas in the short term but some are explicitly looking at the transition from that generation to hydrogen in the medium to long term.  We find that some really have that long-term perspective and ambition for decarbonisation that they bring with demand.

The opportunity presented by smart services for consumers to lower their bills and participate in decarbonisation is already there.  All suppliers are required to offer time-of-use tariffs and many customers are switching to these.  This presents the opportunity for electric vehicle owners to charge overnight at much lower rates and to keep away from peak times.  It also provides an opportunity for us to measure what is being exported by micro-generation and renewable self-consumers.  It opens up an opportunity for customers to really be part of the transition and save money by lowering their bills.<\/p> <p>  The CRU is proposing to promote the uptake of smart services in the coming year, now that we are getting that critical mass of smart meter stock in place.

There is potential with large-scale offshore wind to think about what we could do as a nation - becoming not just a user of green hydrogen but potentially an exporter in the future.  That is why, as we look at investment in gas generation for the next few decades, the natural gas grid to support that or import facilities, we must also keep our eye on the potential for converting that infrastructure for future hydrogen use so that we take a long-term decarbonisation perspective as we make those investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Regarding Deputy Bruton's question about data centres, one of the reasons I can speak with such confidence about the winter outlook is that we have had extensive engagement with the data centre community.  To give credit where it is due, the data centres have worked in collaboration with us so that if an emergency is declared, they will switch on their generators and be the first port of call this winter in the very unlikely event of the system being very tight.  They have stepped up to the plate and worked with my team.  We can call on them this winter so the general public can sleep at night.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned smart meters.  I signed a new contract in June, have three tariffs and charge my modest electric Golf at night using an app for about 30% below the normal daily rate.  The revolution is happening in the distribution system and all consumers will benefit.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the 10,000 MW of renewables, the provenance of which is the Deputy's climate action plan from 2019 when he was Minister.  My confidence arises from two things.  On the grid side, we have made three decisions in the past 12 months that we arguably might not have made five years ago.  We declared that two major pieces of grid infrastructure are going underground.  The first is in the Dublin-Kildare region where we have made the call and said a critical piece of west Dublin infrastructure is going to be underground.<\/p><p>We have said the line to Mayo will be underground and the converter station for the Celtic Interconnector, one of Ireland's most critical projects which will link us to France, will be located not beside the substation in Knockraha, but in an industrial site in Ballyadam.  This is because that is what communities asked us to do.  I am much more confident on the infrastructure side.  I am watching the offshore side with great interest.  One of the projects is close to my home.  Three projects are out to public consultation in the Irish Sea at the moment.  Fingers crossed, they have been executed in an exemplary manner by the developers.  At this point, we have not seen significant outrage about the proposal to put 5 GW between Dundalk and Arklow.  So far, therefore, we seem to see that through the efforts of the engagement of developers, including ourselves, there was a more positive and less outraged response from the public. <\/p><p> The Deputy's last point was about hydrogen storage.  Ms MacEvilly has spoken about hydrogen.  Batteries are on the system as we speak.  They are a vital part of system stability.  Today, we are capable of running the system at 75% renewables.  We would not be able to do that without batteries.  There are more batteries in the pipeline to provide at least 500 MW, but more will come through in the next auction.  They are a critical part of the overall holistic solution.

My questions are quite specific.  There has been a lot of talk about the demand site reduction and engaging with industry.  How many dispatch instructions under the DS3 programme for demand site reduction have been issued over the past two years?  What was the total amount in payments made by EirGrid to each entity in respect of the demand site reduction?  The transition will not be costless.  However, the public has a right to know how much it is paying industry to reduce its demand side.  What mechanism is in place to ensure that each entity is in compliance with their agreed kWh demand reduction?  The CRU said that if demand reduction is not met there are penalties for capacity remuneration.  Are there the same penalties if it is found that an entity is not reducing its demand by the kWs that it had been, I think the EirGrid speaker said, \"appropriately\" remunerated for?  What is the cost to the Exchequer of that intervention around managing the demand?  My other question is on the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and how it contradicts section 15 of the climate action Bill.  I believe that CRU and EirGrid are obliged to take climate emissions into account, but the 1999 Act obliges them to authorise a demand connection agreement, without having to provide the environmental assessment or the cumulative emissions.  Are changes needed, therefore, in the regulations under the 1999 Act, so that it is not just about fiscal and technical specificities, but takes into account the environmental impact and the cumulative emissions on our energy targets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#N00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I think these questions are for the regulator for the most part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#N00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>As it happens, and this is not passing the buck, I do not have to hand the figures on how many have been dispatched and what the cost has been.

Regarding what each individual unit gets paid for any particular event, if we have a demand reduction and a tightness of the system, they would not get paid where we have to intervene to ask them to reduce their demand during that period.  That is an intervention that we are making in the market.  If they offer up their demands into the system by being part of what is called a demand side unit, DSU, which a number of them do, they are remunerated by being paid the price prevailing in the market at that point in time.

I am not sure from what the Senator said that there is necessarily a conflict in respect of the climate legislation.  Often, we have to read pieces of legislation together.  However, it is fair to say that we have not necessarily built that into our process as yet.  We will reflect on that.  The Acts can be taken together, in terms of how we manage them.  Many connections are for new homes and businesses.  We do not want to stand in the way of these.  We will try to look at it in a pragmatic way.  We called out data centre demand as a specific area that drives particular challenges for the system and we are looking to deal with that demand and those connection requests in a manner that helps them mitigate the impact that they are having on the system.

I will focus my questions around those issues.<\/p> <p>  My first questions are to EirGrid.  There may be an overlap here and I may be directing questions in the wrong way.  We can try to figure that out.  The first question for EirGrid was in relation to the figure of 28% versus 70% in relation to data centre usage.  I think Mr. Foley said that the figure of 70% was \"absolutely not accurate\", and that the closer estimate is around 28%.  Mr. Foley has clarified that, which I welcome.  Having said that, even an estimated 28% used by data centres by the year 2030 is still a significant portion of our energy capacity.  It still needs to be addressed.  My first question is on the assumption that the policy of Government is to continue with some approvals for data centres.<\/p><p>The phrase Mr. Foley used was \"bring something to the table\".  What kind of mitigation measures can data centres bring to the table that are realistic and will actually achieve a reduction in energy use?  Is that being factored into the figure of a 28% increase in demand?  Can that figure of 28% be reduced even further, perhaps through water harvesting or district heating provided in conjunction with the data centres building their own renewable energy supply?  The 28% figure amounts to a large portion of our energy capacity.  I would like some further detail on that.<\/p><p> To return to the short term and this winter, Mr. Foley spoke about the Whitegate and Huntstown plants coming back online, which is most welcome.  I hope it will allay the fears of many that there will be a blackout this winter.  What proportion of overall energy do the Whitegate and Huntstown plants supply?  How much capacity are we expecting them to bring back online?<\/p><p> Ms MacEvilly stated that the data centres can be part of the solution.  I thought that was an interesting comment.

They are coming back and people can rest assured.<br\/><br\/>Second, on the 28% increase in demand, we have to think about it as the product of a growing economy, the electrification of heat and transport and data centres.  It is not all about data centres.  The Deputy asked what we want data centres to do and what we want them to bring to the party.  We need to go outside Dublin to the regions.  I think that is part of the regulator's policy.  We also need to bring in some degree of dispatchable generation so that the burden of generation is not all with the system but is part of what the demand user can bring.  Lastly, we need to make use of batteries and other services that help with the flexibility and stability of the system.  These are very clear, real and tangible propositions that will be forthcoming in the regulator's policy position.  I believe they will be accepted by a significant proportion of the data centre community.

The text of our proposed decision would have described not necessarily a move to the countryside, but co-location, focusing on how we can incentivise demand and supply to co-locate, which reduces the need to invest as much in this infrastructure.  It also reduces some of the transmission losses mentioned by one of the Deputy's colleagues earlier.<\/p> <p>  The second piece is around moving the demand of data centres, where required.  This is commonly used by the data centre community in the US, for example, where data centres turn down processing during the daytime when they need to use lots of air conditioning, which is highly energy-intensive, and turn up processing at night.  It is, therefore, a matter of getting them to adapt not to a day-night peak, but to a peak that might not just be between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., as we generally have it in Ireland, and to also respond to times of significantly scarce wind.  This year alone, we had times in March when wind was giving us over 4,000 MW and times in September when it was giving us less than 40 MW.  Wind can be contrary like that.  As we take advantage of it and decarbonise, we need to look for some solutions.  As Mr. Foley said, the other options are also battery power, which does not just take advantage of excess wind but can also feed it back to the system in times of need, and the on-site generation to which he referred.

That is influencing many of our colleagues, not just in northern and western Europe but also in eastern and central Europe.  Separately, it has been a very poor hydrological year in terms of the hydroelectric plants that many of other countries use.

Normally, these would not come together and we are, therefore, hopeful that the particular pinch points we see now, coming into the winter, will be mitigated.

Our focus is on protecting consumers and ensuring they can manage through the winter.  We know that must be difficult for customers at the moment.  It is important to remind people of the protections in place for vulnerable customers.  One area of which we know there is not as much awareness as there should be is that customers can register to be a vulnerable customer if they are either critically dependent on electricity, for example, for assistive technologies for independent living, or if they are particularly vulnerable to disconnections in the winter period by reason of age or health.  In those cases, a person registered as a critical services customer will not be disconnected for reasons of non-payment.  For those registered as priority customers because they are particularly vulnerable, there is a moratorium in place every year.  This means those customers cannot be disconnected between 1 November to 31 March.  That protection is in place as part of our supplier handbook suite of protections.<\/p> <p>  Over the course of the winter, a halt is also called to disconnections for all customers, usually between 9 December and around 11 March.  The other element that is really important is that all customers are protected all the time by the energy engage code, which means an engaging customer will not be disconnected.  If customers are engaging with their supplier, either by entering into a payment plan or coming to some arrangement around bill payment, whether it is a prepayment meter or otherwise, they will not be disconnected.  One of the important areas that we want to focus on is ensuring that customers are aware of the energy engage code and the need to engage with their supplier.<\/p> <p>  Those are the kind of protections we have in our supplier handbook.

If there is more that we can all collectively do to support customers at a time of high prices and, obviously, what will be difficulty in paying bills, we will do that.

This winter, many families and individuals who would not normally be in difficulty, such as working families, will be heavily affected by this.  I wonder if there is an opportunity to extend the disconnection moratorium beyond the vulnerable.  Ms MacEvilly said there were a few months where it applied to everyone.  Is it possible to extend that for a longer timeframe?  I believe there will be many people who would not normally be in these circumstances who will find themselves in huge difficulty.  I ask Ms MacEvilly to consider that as it would be very welcome.<\/p> <p>  I have listened carefully and it has been a very interesting conversation.  Obviously, the issue of data centres has been topical in the last while.  I am looking to where we are at the moment.  There is a lot of talk of what we can do in regard to demand management, smart metering and so on, which is welcome, but these are all things that will happen in the future.  EirGrid's capacity document stated that it forecast capacity deficits in Ireland over the next five winters so the forecast is that we are going to have issues with our security of supply.  The result of that is the potential for blackouts, which will hopefully be limited, but there is that potential.  There will be higher prices.  We are going to have to move to more oil and gas generation of electricity and we are going to have to rent in additional capacity, which is going to cost hundreds of millions of euro.  Therefore, there is an impact over the next five winters, given the situation we are in.  That demonstrates there has been a failure to manage our energy system.  We have hit crisis point at the moment but it has not been managed to date to avoid that.<\/p> <p>  It would appear the largest increase is from the data centre sector.  EirGrid's statement suggested that all areas of the economy pretty much flatlined and it was in the data centre area that the increase was.  There has been an acknowledgement that there are things the data centres can do, and the CRU is conducting a review.  Does Ms MacEvilly believe the growth of data centres should have been managed and conditioned a lot earlier than now?  We are addressing an issue where we have already hit crisis point.<\/p> <p>  My other question is in regard to the planning process.  EirGrid is not a prescribed body for consultation under the Planning Act.  Does EirGrid believe it would be valuable to be engaged in the planning process at the start, when data centres put in their applications?  The CRU is a prescribed body.  Has there been any engagement?  Is it a regular occurrence that it would receive applications for review and give input on it?  That would be an important part of what it can do.  Those are my two main questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#P00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>On the first point, I welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s input on the disconnections area.  The one part of this that we always bear in mind is that when there is a moratorium on disconnections, suppliers do not engage with their customers, their customers are not getting those reminder letters and they are not getting that level of contact.  What we found at the end of the last moratorium, which ended in May, was that although there were probably not a lot more customers in debt, the ones who were in debt had greater debt, so it had built up the problem more.  It is always that balance that we are trying to manage.  We will listen to the views of the Deputy, the customer stakeholder group and the suppliers, and keep the situation under active review over the course of the winter.<\/p> <p>  I want to respond on the EirGrid generation capacity statement.  It is important to underscore that what it said is \"if no action is taken\", we would have problems over the next five winters.  It is very clear that this is not a situation in which no action can be taken.  It is a call to action and we are responding to that with the publication of our information paper, with the proposals and with managing through that process of delivering the interim measures, as well as the enduring measures, which were always going to require additional gas-fired generation capacity to be delivered by 2030.  We are just having to front-load that now because of the outcome of the auctions.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Gannon outlined earlier, we were disappointed with the outcome of the auctions, the non-delivery of the 500 MW and then the lack of participation by industry in the subsequent auction.  However, it has given us that opportunity to engage, to understand and to address some of the real challenges that generators faced in coming forward with new projects and delivering new projects.  Perhaps Mr. Gannon would like to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I do not want to cover previously covered ground.

As it has continued to grow, we are now looking at further options and a range of those options are available to us.

That is one of the major contributors to the need for that temporary generation.  Again, in looking at the solutions to the longer-term challenge, we are not ignoring the space that data centres take or the fact they are the largest homogenous grouping of demand.  There is a significant challenge that is unique to them but there will also be some opportunity to mitigate it.  We are not hiding from that.  In terms of next winter, it would have been contributory as opposed to primary, without question.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's final point was with regard to planning applications.  Yes, we are a prescribed body and, yes, we are provided with environmental impact statements in order to provide comment on them.

The questions about where the local challenges are on the grid and perhaps the temporary generation project are also for EirGrid.<\/p> <p>  The RESS auctions are led by the Department in terms of time limits.  We and EirGrid participate in the steering group for that but the setting of the rhythm is a question for the Department rather than us.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's request for examples, some developers noted that, despite going through the statutory processes, it might have taken more time than they anticipated.

Part of helping that might be setting policy signals, such as in the national development plan, noting the place of natural gas and the fact it is vital.  Some of this dialogue is required for security of supply.<\/p> <p>  On ancillary infrastructure, it is a risk that some developers perceive that the supporting gas or electricity infrastructure might not come fast enough or might be on the critical path.  In the last few months, as I mentioned, we sent two directions to systems operators to say those grid connections must be prioritised for new generators coming in.  That was an example of a little bit of responsiveness.<\/p> <p>  On the economic signals, the SEM committee recently finished a consultation on the parameters which set some of those signals for the T-3, which is the first auction in January, and I think will shortly go out for consultation on the T-4, which is the next auction in March.  That has taken input from industry and other observers on what parameters we might set and what volumes we might ask for in these auctions and to see who we can bring to the table.

Does LNG have a role to play in the absence of an indigenous supply?<\/p> <p>  The third question is on an issue I picked up in the papers this morning.  It relates to the heightening of Brexit tensions we are seeing and the ramifications for energy security in the event of a breakdown in relations.  The island of Ireland is at the end of the pipeline.  I read in a newspaper that the French minister for Europe has raised points regarding the UK's reliance on France for energy security.

Solar photovoltaic energy, more of which will come into the system in the coming years, will address the daytime peak of demand in the summertime and will be complementary to wind.  It remains a fact that in addition to the daytime peak we naturally see between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., we have a dunkelflaute, a two-week period of cold, non-windy weather in the darkness of winter.

I would like to ask the CRU about the greater use of gas and LNGs.  Even after all the discussion, how does the regulator think it is compatible with our climate goals?  In its submission, the regulator stated it would be prudent for the review of our energy security to include an examination of the future role of LNG.  Many people watching will find that worrying because there have been campaigns against LNGs being brought into the country, following on from the successful campaign to ban the production of fracked gas in this country.  There is a concern that it will be imported.  I understand that not all LNGs are fracked, but a significant number of them are.  Will the regulator examine that distinction in its review of the role of LNGs?<\/p><p>Ms MacEvilly says the CRU did not consider a moratorium on data centres unlike, say, Singapore, where 7% of the grid was being used up by data centres.  Singapore is another country that relies very much on FDI and the tech sector but it introduced a moratorium because it considered data centre energy use way too much.  We are not introducing a moratorium, yet the members of the tech sector who spoke to the <i>Business Post<\/i>just over a week ago said they did not support relocation facilities outside Dublin and do not support the condition of building on-site generation to power their operations.  What would happen, from the point of view of the CRU, if data centre businesses were to say to the CRU that they do not want those conditions and will not adhere to them?  Dr. McGowan said it is not necessarily about moving outside Dublin but about colocation.  Could he expand on that slightly?<br\/><br\/>My next question to the CRU is about water.  At the outset Ms MacEvilly told us the CRU has a role to protect the interests in water.  There have been startling revelations from data centre.  Facts show that from 500,000 l to 5 million l a day can be used by one single data centre.  Could the witnesses comment on any concerns they may have about the expansion of data centres in this country and the security of our water supply?<br\/><br\/>I turn to EirGrid.  We debated earlier in our private session EirGrid's assertion that potentially 70% of the power in this country could be used by data centres.  It has been said that that was misquoted at this committee.  I refer Mr. Foley to a letter from EirGrid to CRU of 27 May 2021 and to the paragraph that finishes with &quot;data centres with a load of 60 MW would be comparable to the load usage of a small town like Kilkenny&quot;.  The figures are in that paragraph.  I just did a calculation and it amounts to a load of 69.02% of the grid, which is not 70% but not far off it.  That is where that calculation came from.  It was not plucked out of the air and was not mischievous; it actually came from EirGrid itself.  In the same letter - and this is what really baffles me - EirGrid says, &quot;Ireland's electricity system was surely not planned to be, nor designed to be, a system which seeks to serve the needs of the global citizen for increased data supported by an ever proportionately smaller non-data centre, commercial, industrial and domestic load&quot;.  I am really alarmed by the difference in the tone from EirGrid to the CRU from May until now.  Mr. Foley talked about what the data centres have to &quot;bring to the party&quot;, which was his phrase, or the dialogue EirGrid has had with them.  Could he please tell us when that dialogue took place and if it was prompted by the stark warning EirGrid gave in May about the load that data centres were putting on the system?  Could he comment also on what that dialogue entailed?  I know he said EirGrid got a positive response in that some of the data centres are willing to locate and some are prepared, if there is high demand, to power down, but those are not the reports we are getting back through the media.  There is a disconnect and a real change in the tone.<br\/><br\/>I will put one very last question to the witnesses.  This acute crisis in energy supply is facing everybody across Europe, and the cost increases are being borne largely by the public.  It is harder for the public to bear them than it is for business, but there will be considerable investment in the generation and network assets that will be required to bring data centres onto the national grid.  Can the witnesses tell me who will bear the cost of that investment?  Will it be the taxpayer, the ordinary people and the person paying for his or her electricity or gas bills or will it be the data centres themselves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2021100500002#R01000","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>There are an awful lot of questions in that.

That is why we are happy to support that investment.<\/p> <p>  It is simply the case that as we are becoming so reliant on gas, and then reliant on a single source of gas via the UK, it is only prudent to consider LNG as a potential option.  We note the Government policy and the concerns that have been expressed.  There is not always that direct link between LNG and fracked gas.  One can get non-fracked gas from LNG.  A lot of EU shipments come from Qatar, where there is conventional production.  Equally, one can get fracked gas via pipelines.  Therefore, we do not think it is so much the infrastructure, that is, the LNG facility, that is of concern.  We think there may be other ways.  There is a new EU proposal on methane leakage reduction which might help prevent the import of higher methane emission gas sources, wherever they come from, which we think might be another opportunity.  If we think of the likes of additional gas infrastructure, whether LNG or otherwise, as an opportunity for future green hydrogen infrastructure, I think there are potentials and possibilities there that we should not close off.

Our experience in having dialogue with the industry is that more of them are looking at longer-term battery storage, which may not be able to just replace backup generation; it may also be uninterruptible power supply units, UPS, that help them in cases where their electricity is shut off due to a fault, even internally within their site, and it could support them in a number of different ways.  Separately, some are certainly looking at natural gas generation on the site, co-located on their campus.  Some are looking at the long-term future of that and what it could be converted to, including being fired by hydrogen in the longer term.

What we are seeing in electricity costs at the moment is unprecedented.  The last time we saw increases of this scale was in 2008 and it is probably worse at the moment.  What we are seeing across the EU are a number of factors which are leading to increasing prices of this scale for customers across the Union.  It is a shared challenge and a deep concern for regulators and policymakers.  I will outline the relevant factors.  Gas is more expensive at the moment.  That has an impact on gas bills but because we use gas-fired generation, it feeds through to electricity prices.  It is not so much that the gas generators are expensive to run <i>per se<\/i>.  They are efficient usually.  It is that they have to buy gas on the international market as well and the price of that gas feeds through.  In addition, carbon prices have increased and that feeds through to the price of electricity.  We have seen a very low wind period over the summer, which means we did not have the nice mitigating impact of wind generation which can lower day-ahead market prices.  There has, therefore, been a series of circumstances which is leading to this general increase in electricity and gas prices for consumers.

We are moving to a position, as announced yesterday, where we will generate 80% of our electricity from renewables in 2030.  That is staggering.

As she said, I am head of strategic organising and campaigns at SIPTU and I am joined by Deborah Reynolds, an early years professional and SIPTU activist.  SIPTU is the union for early years professionals and represents approximately 6,000 educators, room leaders and managers working in community and private early years services throughout Ireland.  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting us here today to discuss how low levels of Government funding have resulted in poverty pay for early years professionals and have given rise to an acute staffing shortage.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic highlighted just how crucial early years services are to children, families and the wider economy.  Early years professionals worked on the front line in the depths of the pandemic, caring for and educating the children of other essential workers, as well as vulnerable children.  We could not reopen society without reopening early years services.  Beyond the pandemic, 50 years of research has shown that high-quality early years education and care enhances children&rsquo;s holistic development, including educational outcomes, reduces child poverty and disadvantage, supports families, promotes social inclusion and enhances future employability.  For every &euro;1 invested in high-quality provision, the State can expect a return of &euro;7 to &euro;12 over time.  Affordable services also facilitate parents&rsquo; workforce participation, especially for women, and is a key means of addressing gender inequality.<\/p> <p>  However, despite the many benefits of high-quality services, and a significant increase in government spending in recent years, Ireland spends just 0.3% of GDP on early years.<\/p><p>This is far below the European average of 0.8% and the UNICEF-recommended benchmark of 1%.  This unsustainable funding gap has resulted in a crisis where professionals earn poverty wages, parents pay some of the highest fees in Europe and providers struggle with sustainability.  The depth of the crisis for both employees and employers was highlighted in the early years staffing survey for 2021 published by the New Deal for Early Years coalition this October.  It revealed that 42% of early years professionals are actively seeking work outside the sector, with 78% stating that if things stay the same, they do not intend to work within the sector in 12 months&rsquo; time.  Pay is by far the biggest factor driving people out of their profession, at 78%, followed by stress at 8%.  Some 89% of early years professionals would not recommend a career in early years to a friend or family member.<br\/><br\/>For managers and owner-managers, the situation is equally as stark.  Some 71% found it extremely difficult to recruit new staff over the last 12 months with low pay being the biggest obstacle for 55% of respondents.  It was a significant obstacle for an additional 35%.  Almost all managers and owner-managers are concerned that problems recruiting and retaining staff will negatively impact on service provision.  The top concerns were an impact on quality for children, a reduced number of children that can be cared for, and difficulty maintaining staff.  This crisis has been driven by low pay and underfunding.  According to the Pobal annual early years sector profile, early years educators, who constitute 55% of all staff working with children, earn just &euro;11.91 per hour on average, 99 cent below the living wage for Ireland in 2021.  Managers and owner-managers, who shoulder significant responsibilities, earn on average just &euro;15.28 per hour.  Basic conditions like maternity pay, sick pay or a pension are rare.  Too many are forced to choose between poverty pay, retraining for a different career or emigrating to a country that properly values qualified and dedicated early years professionals.  In preparation for this committee meeting, we asked early years professionals to put in their own words how low pay is affecting them.<br\/><br\/>Here is a sample of the responses we received.  One states:<\/p><blockquote>\tMany of our Early Childhood Educators are at breaking point.  We are physically and mentally drained.  I work in a centre with 27 staff and almost 200 children.  In the past 2 months, 5 staff members have handed in their notice, some taking jobs as waitresses or bartenders as the pay is much better.  We have numerous staff working a second job in the evenings and weekends just to make ends meet.  We are losing some of the best childcare workers and will continue to do so until something drastically changes. <\/blockquote><p>Another states:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe low pay in my job has left me wondering how much longer I can stay in this sector.  I'm a single parent of two teenagers.  With this comes bigger shopping bills, more money needed for their clothes and my eldest looks like she will definitely be heading to college (hopefully).  I presently work for &euro;10.20 per hour, 25 hours per week, and I also get the Working Family Payment.  I just finished my Level 6 in childcare and wonder why I bothered.  I feel so let down by our government to be honest, they know how things are but still want staff to be highly qualified but pay me less than a supermarket worker.  I am presently in debt to my 84 year old mother because I needed a new cooker last year.  With bills and a car, I can't pay her back yet.  Now I'm buying oil for the house with my children's allowance, so another month goes by with nothing put aside for Christmas and I still don&rsquo;t have money to pay back an elderly parent.  Truthfully if there is not substantial change in this budget I will have to consider a better paid job in a supermarket over my preferred career.  Something has to change and fast. <\/blockquote><p>Another states:<\/p><blockquote>\tPaying my staff such low rates of pay is my biggest moral struggle when it comes to running my own preschool sessional service.  I ask huge responsibility of them, and I take on huge responsibility, for very little in return.  They have to live on very low income and have big outgoings like everyone else in this country.  They are not employed for 52 weeks of the year so it limits their life and what plans they can make, for example applying for loans or mortgages.  They have no other benefits like maternity pay or sick leave.  My latest problem is trying to find a new staff member.  I can't find them and let's be honest, with such low staff levels available and very little to actually offer them, it's becoming a scary thought whether my little business will survive. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I have to stop Mr. O'Connor there because we are over time for his opening address.

I know that in many community colleges that serve communities that are less likely to go on to level 8 or level 9 honours degrees, people would be pushed towards childcare, such as in An Cos&aacute;n.  It is sold as a career choice.  From the experience of Mr. O'Connor and SIPTU's members, what are the demographics of childcare workers beyond gender?  Is there a class element?  How professional do we see the sector as being?  Are we funnelling working-class people into low-paid jobs even though it is a professional sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#B00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>There is a class element.  That is an interesting take on it.  It rings true to me.  You see community colleges or education and training boards where people might qualify with a level 5 or level 6 and go into low-paid jobs.  We also see graduates who have gone to Dublin City University or any university around the country which offers this course who also come out into a low-paid job.  There is not a substantial difference arising from a person's level of qualification or background.  Generally, people working as early years educators, if they have a level 5 or level 6, or a room leader who might have higher qualifications, are all on low rates of pay.  The gender dimension is probably the biggest factor.  Caring work and educational work are just not valued at all, at least in how that is reflected in people's wages.  No one is getting the recognition, no matter what qualification or background they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for his opening statement and highlighting the essential role of high-quality early years care and education that we know enhances children's holistic development.  His point that the State spends just 0.3% of GDP on early years care is of considerable concern.  It is well below the European average of 0.8% and the UNICEF benchmark recommendation of 1%.  I take it that we can assume that the rest is left to families to make up the difference, which explains why childcare is so expensive.  Mr. O'Connor highlights that pay is the most significant factor for people leaving the profession.  If funding was increased for pay in budget 2020, how could we ensure that it goes to staff?  We know that this is primarily a female sector, as Mr. O'Connor mentioned.  It is important to acknowledge how sectoral pay issues contribute to the gender pay gap, as does the absence of State provision for childcare.  A survey that SIPTU released earlier this year showed that 90% of childcare workers struggled to make ends meet.  Some 77% have no work sick pay scheme and 10% receive paid maternity leave from their employer.  Do we need statutory requirements to address these issues or would other measures help too?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#B00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

If we do, how do we make sure we put the money in where the State is confident that it is able to achieve its policy goals with regard to the delivery of high-quality, affordable and sustainable services?<\/p><p> Certainly, one of the recent developments is the establishment of the joint labour committee for the early years sector.  It means that the union employers can negotiate rates of pay for the different grades across the sector.  That would give the State the confidence that if it invests additional money, it knows that the money will go towards pay if that is what it is there for.  Of course, other money is needed for general sustainability and affordability within the sector as well.  That is essentially the decision we have to make.  If we think it is an important service, are we going to invest in it?  If we do not, we are left with the existing crisis of high fees, which are driving up the cost of living, and low pay, which is forcing high staff turnover and impacting on quality and sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

It is so important that we appreciate and respect our childcare workers.  They are graduated childcare workers.  That is where we seem to be falling down.  I have a massive issue with this.  We saw over the pandemic that they were the front-line workers who allowed our front-line workers to go to work.  We must, therefore, now make sure that we work with this budget.  I have made several representations to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Taoiseach about making sure our childcare sector is not forgotten in this budget.  We need to give them the recognition, and, I will say again, the respect they deserve.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to many of the childcare workers in my area of Carlow-Kilkenny.  It is a worry when we see that they cannot get a mortgage because they are not earning enough money.  When they apply for a mortgage or a loan, they cannot access either because of the low pay, which they should not be on.  It even worried me when Mr. O'Connor spoke about workers who are leaving the sector.  If a person is a childcare worker or a childcare professional, such as we have, that is a dedication and a vocation.  When you are dealing with children, you become close to them and become attached.  It is a vocation.  It is like our own job; it is not just nine-to-five.  Cr&egrave;che owners I met spoke about the amount of weekend work they are doing.  Paperwork is another area that needs to be looked at.  These professionals are doing so much paperwork now.  There is much after-hours work and some weekend work.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  I listened to Mr. O'Connor's contribution, which was excellent.  I believe that we need to make changes.  I firmly hope there are changes in the budget for our childcare professionals, and rightly so, because they deserve that.  We spoke about the proposal for pay scales and the best way for a career structure.  What does Mr. O'Connor see as the best way for a career structure?  I know the model has to change.  There is no question that we need to change the model.  Unless we change the model, we are not going to sort the issue.  Can Mr. O'Connor perhaps outline what kind of model he thinks could be good going forward?  He spoke about the joint labour committee for the early years sector that was set up by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I welcome that because it is important.  What does Mr. O'Connor think of this on an ongoing basis?  As someone who works with our childcare professionals and sees the great job they are doing, does he think this will be part of the solution?<\/p> <p>  I am a granny.  My own daughters are both front-line workers.  Without being able to put their two boys into childcare during the pandemic, they would not have been able to work.  Childcare affects every family.

When it is all over, my phone will be out and I will either be sending text messages to people celebrating the fact that we have gotten something good, or else, to be honest, if we do not see anything significant ring-fenced in the budget for wages, I am going to get text messages from people saying they are going to type up their letter of resignation.<\/p><p>That is simply the way it is.  Sometimes, when we see statistics on the staffing crisis, Pobal figures and so on, the reality does not hit.  We cannot fix everything next week but we need to plug a leak.

That is a fundamental right that is afforded to swathes of the economy and most professions have that ability as well.  It is a space to be able to stand as an equal and negotiate something that has a very significant impact on your life, and that is the joint labour committee process.  It is the most appropriate avenue.  There was a very good process involving many stakeholders and this was what emerged.  The only thing that holds it back is how much money is in the pot to be able to improve wages, professionalise the sector and make pay and conditions reflective of the qualifications and experience people have.  That is where we are able to put our money where our mouth is when we talk about recognising and professionalising the sector.<\/p> <p>  There is a great deal of expectation and optimism about this budget.  The Minister has been on the record several times about the need to improve wages and how the new funding model, which will see greater investment, is a part of the budget negotiations.  Quite rightly, there is optimism there as well, but we need to get it over the line because people have been holding on for some kind of result for a number of years, particularly during the past year, through a pandemic.  We can clap all we want but when people are using food banks - which is true; members of ours are using food banks - they need to see some reward in their pay packet.

What we are hearing from them and others such as parents, childcare providers and staff is that this is a crisis in the sector beyond just staffing.  The current Government policy is failing staff and parents, who are paying the second highest household childcare costs in the OECD, with couples spending an average of 24% of income and single parents spending 29% of their wages on childcare costs.  We are also failing providers, which are telling us it is difficult to make ends meet.  Our guests presented to us figures from managers and owner-managers, as well as from staff.  We are also failing children if we are not providing proper, high-quality and affordable childcare and ensuring that all children are equally provided for.<\/p> <p>  One of the main issues I am hearing in Dublin Bay South, and I am sure others are hearing it too, concerns the simple lack of places, in particular affordable ones, in childcare facilities and cr&egrave;ches.  Clearly, it is very important that we have moved to a living wage and the point about the joint labour committee was well made.  Beyond that, I have called for a Donogh O'Malley moment, that is, we need to see a change in Government policy overall such that every child in Ireland will be guaranteed an early years place and the State will ensure that is so.  We should move from this piecemeal provision, whereby we rely on private providers, to a State-guaranteed model, as we did with secondary education, in order that the subsidies from the State, which already are considerable, will afford us a better value, State-guaranteed childcare service.<\/p> <p>  Our guests might wish to comment on that, although it has gone a little beyond the focus of the session.  It always seems to me that rather than talk just about wages, although that is very important, we need also to talk more generally about how we need to reform or radically revise the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#D00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Ms Reynolds might wish to come in on this as well but I will comment briefly.  The Deputy is correct; everybody is getting a raw deal.  Pay is obviously a top concern for our union but for many of our members, in early years and outside it, the cost is a big problem, as is accessibility.  The truth is there is a market system in Ireland that is the basis of how childcare has evolved.  In general, State money that is invested can be used either to improve pay and quality or to reduce fees.  Providers are put in a terrible position of trying to strike a balance between those two policy objectives but they need to be separated out.  Our point is there should be dedicated funding lines, particularly for pay, which would reduce outgoings for providers, allow for lower fees and put that regulation on wages in order that people will be properly rewarded.  That kind of demarketisation would mean the current providers, private and community, would have a key role to play but in a kind of a partnership with the State.<\/p> <p>  My greatest fear is that if we take a hands-off approach, we will end up in the space that can be seen in the UK, the US and New Zealand, where there is a financialisation of the early years sector.  It is not the little playschool down the road but internationally backed investment funds, which see this as an opportunity and are concerned only about the rate of return.  What happens in all those countries is that there will be, embedded and almost impossible to reverse, a small number of very powerful providers - multinationals, in some cases.  The high fees and low pay are embedded and it is very difficult to get out of it.<\/p> <p>  We are certainly at a crossroads.  The new funding model has very eminent people on it and we have not seen the details of it.  We hope it will address these concerns and we have raised them with those people but we are at a crossroads as to what type of sector we want.  Do we want an industry for private finance to be able to make a good rate of return or a profession of which providers and people working on the ground, that is, the professionals themselves, can be proud?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Darragh O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor and Ms Reynolds for their powerful contributions.

I understand, therefore, the chronic shortage of staff and the fact that many good people were lost because of a lack of grandfathering practices when the regulations were introduced in 2016, and the burden of administration such that even the preschool regulations seem to be orientated towards avoiding the risk of litigation rather than the practical provision of childcare.

Our ambition, along with those of a lot of other organisations in this sector, is that people have people who have degree qualifications should get degree-levels of pay.  Mercer, the consultancy firm, did a benchmarking exercise a couple of years ago and set out what those pay scales should look like.  That is our ambition and is where we want to get to.  The JLC process is a legal process that has to be endorsed through the Oireachtas.  Hopefully, it will be up and running in the next couple of weeks.  One of the things that we have been waiting for is to know how much money is in the pot in the budget.  We also have been waiting to know about the new funding model and the JLC is integrated into both of those.  This can happen relatively quickly and certainly next year.  In the short term, we would hope that people will be above the living wage.  However, that is all dependent on the amount of money that goes into the sector.  Providers can only pay the money that they have.  It is up to the State, which is a key player, although it is not the employer.  It funds the vast majority of the sector at the moment.  If it wants to help retain staff, drive equality and drive professionalisation, that will cost money.

Quality in the sector worries many people.  I have been in the sector for 15 years.  Policy after policy from the Government has pushed for quality.  The one thing that has never happened, despite all that has been asked of us, is pay, that is, a reward for the hard work that we have put in place.<\/p> <p>  Since 2016, as the staffing crisis has become more apparent, we have seen a challenge to quality.  The recent OECD report, the Starting Strong report, talks about process quality.  Process quality is what the OECD calls the key driver of children's development, learning and well-being.  That will come from interactions, having conversations with children and creating a safe and secure environment for them in order that they can blossom.  Sometimes we can get mired in talking about statistics, in what is happening next and in what is happening now.  Yet, something that can be done next week - although I know there is a lot to do in the future - is an improvement in pay.  An improvement in pay would stop the exodus of staff from the sector.  There may still be a few who may go down the road and get a better job in a supermarket or a restaurant, where they can get better pay.  However, some people will stay if the Government puts a bit of hope in the budget next week by investing in the JLC.  <\/p> <p>  A by-product of investing in wages and people staying in the sector would be an improvement in quality.  If there is an average of 23% turnover in settings and a 40% turnover in some full day care cr&egrave;ches, the process quality must start over and over again each time a new staff member arrives.  It is not fair on families, on children or on staff.  There are many problems but if we are talking about the future, we can have that conversation.  However, in a situation in which staff cannot afford their electricity bill, are struggling to save for Christmas or are unsure whether they will be able to put fuel in their car for next week, were the Government to put pay into the pockets of workers and early years professionals, a by-product of that would be to help the development of quality, which would help children and families.  It would develop the quality sector for which the Department pushes constantly.  This would help families but it would also help the professionals who work in the sector.  <\/p> <p>  What we are seeking next week is a good foundation on which to build over the next couple of years in order that we can build upon and go back for our next JLC and improve upon it all the time.  As we improve the investment into the sector, we should bring our wages up to EU levels.  In other EU countries, early years professionals are vastly better paid than we are.  I know of people who are at the end of their tether.  These are managers and staff who have been working through the pandemic and who are burned out and stressed.  They just want a reward.  They do not want appreciation or a pat on the back or a &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;.  They would like to see something concrete and tangible, namely, an improvement in their wages next week.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deborah Reynolds"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am the manager of Urlingford and Johnstown community childcare centres and I am a national council member of the Association of Childhood Professionals, ACP.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Marian Quinn, who is the chairperson of the ACP.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth introduced the national childcare scheme, NCS, in November 2019.  The scheme provides grants for working parents for the first time.  Given the high cost of childcare, due to historic underinvestment by successive Governments, this is a welcome first step towards supporting families to access affordable childcare.<\/p> <p>  While the NCS has been positive for many families, unfortunately it has negatively impacted thousands of children from disadvantaged and marginalised families.  These children and families were previously supported with targeted schemes, which recognised that children from families who are marginalised and disadvantaged require additional supports to provide equity of access, opportunity, participation and outcomes.  The scheme helped children to access services that were warm, safe, welcoming, stimulating and child-centred.  Children received hot meals, emotional support and were provided with a haven from the stresses in their lives.  The amalgamation of these targeted schemes makes it clear that children from households where their parents are unemployed or inactive are at a significantly higher risk of poverty and deprivation.  While motivating parents to participate in labour force training and education is one possible solution, it cannot be at the detriment of the child by using a carrot and stick approach.  Children must be supported in their own right.  The central objective of an early years and after-school policy must be to adhere to a children&rsquo;s rights approach.  However, by focusing on activating parents, the NCS broadens the gap of inequity between children and pushes disadvantaged children into a more vulnerable situation.<\/p> <p>  The policy focus of the NCS discriminates against children based on the status of their parent or guardian, and infringes on children's rights under Articles 2 and 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The State is intentionally discriminating against children in a bid to motivate their parent or guardian to undertake employment, education or training.  Equal access to care and educational supports are being withheld from children because of their parents.<\/p> <p>  The Government is aware that withholding childcare supports could have a detrimental effect on the welfare and well-being of children who are marginalised and disadvantaged.  Access to formative education and care should be a universal right, and not conditional on compliance with a wider Government policy or agenda.  The primary objective of the Government should be to support all families and provide extra supports to those most in need.  Children should not be used as pawns in a wider Government policy that puts them into a more vulnerable position.  We should also not wait until a family is in crisis before we offer enhanced supports similar to those enjoyed by children of a parent or guardian who in employment, training or education.<\/p> <p>  Early years and after-school care is about much more than work activation.  It is about children's well-being and happiness, supports for families, children's rights, reducing child poverty, social justice, and giving all children a good start in life.  The First 5 programme is a whole-of-government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families.  It is a ten-year plan to help to make sure all children have positive early experiences and get a great start in life.  It must be a plan for all children regardless of the status of their parent or guardian.

I am the team leader of the Dolphin House Homework Club.  I am accompanied by Ms Amy Carey, who is the CEO of the Solas Project.  We represent the Dublin 8 After School Alliance, which is made up of community after-school projects from across the Dublin 8 area.  These services provide vital daily after-school support to over 500 children in areas such as Dolphin House, Oliver Bond Street, Basin Lane, Fatima and St. Michael's Estate.<\/p> <p>  We are here because the national childcare scheme actively risks the closure of our community-based after-school services.  The scheme is a replacement for the community childcare scheme, CCS, which was originally set up to support children from disadvantaged areas who were most at risk.  The scheme will have a serious impact on the education and well-being of children in Dublin 8 and of over 5,000 children nationally.<\/p> <p>  Statistics show that children and young people in urban Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools only account for 4% of entrants to higher education whereas progression rates to third level are as high as 99% in more affluent areas.  We believe that all children in DEIS areas need access to community after-school projects to support their opportunities and minimise structural and educational disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  The national childcare scheme is a labour activation model where funding is based on the employment status of a parent or guardian.  We are here to draw attention to the needs and rights of the most at-risk children and young people in our communities.  The children who attend our community after-school services are growing up in communities where there are cycles of generational poverty, educational disadvantage and social exclusion.  Some children are homeless or live in overcrowded accommodation.  Many of them live in places where there is not enough space for a table on which to do homework or eat a hot meal, never mind a suitable space to play.  Many of their parents have also experienced educational disadvantage and struggle to support their children's academic needs.  The situation for children is further compounded by issues relating to addiction within families, people living with disabilities, gang-related violence, single parent families and children at risk of early school leaving.<\/p> <p>  Community after-school centres offer a safe, consistent and welcoming space where children get educational support and space for emotional, social and physical development.  Since Covid the gap has widened for children from marginalised communities in terms of education, which means they will fall even further behind the national average for literacy and numeracy.<\/p><p> Statistics show that anxiety and depression are among the biggest health issues affecting both children and adults in Ireland at present.  Community after-schools give children a place where their needs are met.  The rights of children to play, develop, be creative, be exposed to new experiences and supported to reach their full potential is at the core of this work.  After-schools are not childcare.  They are an equality measure aimed at reducing the gap of educational disadvantage.  Children should not need referral to go to their community centre and into their after-school club.  They should not need sponsorship to play with their friends in a safe space.  They do not need sponsorship to have their dinner and do their homework.  These are fundamental needs and rights of children.<\/p><p> The Dublin 8 After School Alliance calls on the Government to immediately restore adequate funding to ensure the continuation of community after-school projects, to ensure access to community after-school projects for all children in DEIS areas and marginalised rural communities and to work with community services to design a sustainable and appropriate model of core funding for after-schools to ensure equal access to education and opportunities for all children and, in particular, those most at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank the contributors.

Currently, we are working to keep children within primary and secondary education; we are working to keep children in the system and in the classroom.

The NCS is currently risking the closure of all our after-school projects.

At present, we are subsidised by the wage subsidy scheme, which is due to end at the end of October.  That has been a plaster on the problem and has kept us going for the last year and a half, but there is a risk that we will not be sustainable within the next year or two.  All after-school projects will be forced to close if a sustainable model is not put in place.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the sponsorship, we do not see that as an appropriate or suitable way to provide supports for children.  It is a hurdle for parents and is very complex.  It adds administrative issues for providers and for the sponsorship bodies.  We do not believe it is a suitable way.  We are calling for a model to be put in place for communities such as ours whereby all children should have access.  It should not just be somebody who is referred.

I, too, will focus my questions on the alliance group.  If we accept that the definition in the strategy of the Department of Education is that DEIS schools are for delivering equality of opportunity in schools, then a child who is in a DEIS school should automatically require after-school support, and the funding should follow.  Indeed, there should be before-school support.  It should begin from early in the morning with breakfasts to a full, comprehensive after-school support.  The NCS has obviously affected that, albeit unintentionally.  As I see it and as we are articulating it in advocating to the Minister, this is about either a youth work support or else a childcare support.  It does not matter where the funding stream comes from as long as it is immediately plugged and there is recognition of the need for it.  Aligned to that, a couple of weeks ago the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, launched a comprehensive literacy, numeracy and digital literacy programme, which I am assisting in ensuring it gets out to the public and possibly to the parents of these children, therefore also underlining that they need the after-school support, the homework club support or whatever it is.

We have disadvantaged and marginalised children living in more affluent or working areas.

We are not childcare in that sense.  For the past number of years there have been talks around regulations and qualifications for community after-school services that we would welcome.  This year, after-school services had to register under Tusla and submit policies and procedures to become regulated.

It is definitely something being looked at under the workforce development plan and it is about bringing in qualifications.  There is a growing recognition of the type of work happening in school-age childcare services and it is about supporting children in educational, social, emotional and cultural disadvantage, etc.  A complex skill set is required and this should be phased in over time.  Members have just heard about the crisis in the early years sector and by introducing qualifications to the school-age childcare sector, it could bring a crisis if it is not phased in appropriately.  Over time we will be looking at qualification requirements comparable with what is in early years, given the complexity of the work done there.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cairns asked about where we would situate and what needs to happen now.  We must redefine what is school-age childcare.  Under legislation, it is very much about support for parents when they are working.  It does not have children at its core so we must create a new vision for school-age childcare that has children at its core.  It will clearly involve supporting families in engaging in the workforce as well but that cannot be the main thrust.  We must have children's rights at its core.<\/p> <p>  There was mention of the supports required for school-age childcare with respect to the national childcare scheme.  Children in crisis may be sponsored and can get their needs met.  Children who have a parent or parents working may also get their needs met with enhanced hours during term time.  However, children whose parent or parents are not working - for whatever multitude of reasons - do not get support.  I know part of the reason for this is us wanting to break the cycle of poverty or intergenerational poverty but we need a multipronged approach.  One of those prongs can involve supporting the parent or parents in whatever they need to be able to engage in training, education or work but we must also consider what a child in the here and now needs.  A child has one childhood and this is about early intervention and prevention.  We could spend much more later on and the child will have lost the potential for a rich childhood he or she should and could have.  The process needs to change now.<\/p> <p>  There are community services representatives here who do significant work but this is about children all over the country.  As my colleague, Mr. Kenny, alluded to, the targeted schemes were opened to private providers.  The national childcare scheme is also open to private providers.  There are pockets around the country where children may not be in crisis but they are in need.  We must move from the crisis model, where we only really support families when they are in crisis.<\/p> <p>  There is an action plan for school-age childcare and there is much planned for that type of childcare.  Unfortunately, very often this gets lumped in with early years but these are two very different stages.  We must stop doing that.  In the meantime, while there is consideration of a new model for school-age childcare and whether it has a DEIS-type model or not, there will be a few years of development so we must now open to any child who could have availed of supports under the targeted schemes.  There are siblings on those legacy targeted schemes but a younger child cannot access them under the national childcare scheme.  That must be stopped.  We should look at this immediately and while we are working on the best model for children all over.  We must ensure any service providing for the needs of children does not close.  They must be supported wherever they are as they are vital for early intervention and prevention.<\/p> <p>  The Department deals with both children and youth.  If we are talking about play, youth work and early years skill, the process becomes very complex in terms of who can work in the sector.  It would be a multidisciplinary approach.

In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, I work with after-school groups that each year do not know what funding they will get.  It becomes an issue because funding is not guaranteed year to year.  The DEIS model in disadvantaged areas was raised earlier.  That needs to be a priority.  It is not prioritised enough, which is unacceptable.  I know of parents who send their children to schools where there are school meal programmes because they are finding it so hard to survive.  That is what will happen.  There are schools that do not have DEIS status and there are other schools that have free meals.  Parents are sending their children to certain schools purely because they have free meals.  That is the society we are living in.<\/p><p> Poverty during childhood has both short and long-term negative effects and is associated with the worst outcomes in regard to almost all key aspects of a child's life.  The OECD has noted that the pandemic has harmed children's health and social and material well-being, with the poorest children suffering the most.  Area-based childhood programmes and targeted supports are needed.  I accept they are a priority in the national development plan, the review of which was launched yesterday, but we need to ensure this will happen.  Will our guests tell us more about how these targeted programmes disappeared with the formation of the NCS?  That issue was raised with me.<\/p><p> Ireland signed up to the European child guarantee in June 2021, which aims to prevent and combat child poverty and social exclusion in the EU.  In supporting new types of childcare, do we need to focus more on community-based co-operatives, employer-led schemes and co-location?  As Deputies, we are all aware of this issue.  On many occasions, families have told me how much they appreciate the homework clubs and the after-school services.  They are so important.  We cannot end up losing after-school services or homework clubs because of a lack of funding.  Funding is the biggest issue.  It all boils down to funding but it is also about ensuring that for the children who are marginalised and suffering the most, we will keep the schemes going.

The initial changes in funding to target disadvantaged children occurred in 2015 or 2016, when the Department started reviewing whether there was a case to recoup funding from the targeted schemes.  In 2017, on legal advice, the Department changed the funding rules, where children used to be funded for the place they attend, to an attendance base, which is similar to the national childcare scheme at the moment.  In 2018 and into 2019, the Department directed Pobal to carry out compliance visits on services.  It was directed to target services that had the highest level of funding, which traditionally were services in disadvantaged areas.  It directed Pobal to set the compliance bar quite high, knowing that would be detrimental to many of the services.<\/p> <p>  We carried out a report on the matter and, in 2018 and 2019, we tracked that about &euro;5.7 million had been withdrawn from about 1,000 childcare services.  Nevertheless, while it had technically been withdrawn from the childcare services, in essence it was withdrawn from the children.  Having spoken to several services throughout the country, I know they appealed on a children&rsquo;s rights basis.  There were complex circumstances and many families were in need of support, but this was not taken into consideration.  The rule was the rule.  For various issues, such as the child being dropped in late or collected early, funding was withdrawn but that did not take into consideration the wrap-around supports many services provide, such as the hot meals and the parenting supports.  Sometimes, a child might need to be in by 9 a.m. but you might be happy to see him or her coming in at 10 a.m. because even at that time, there is an opportunity to support the child and the family.  We need that sort of flexibility.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, with the NCS, many children are locked out of after-school services because they are not entitled to it based on the status of the parent.  Even in the early years sector, in the case of many children who had been entitled to substantial funding to support them with breakfast, lunch and hot meals, their funding has been cut right back.  The EWSS was a lifeline for many services.  Many of them, especially in disadvantaged areas, believe the EWSS is obscuring issues with the national childcare scheme and the loss of the targeted schemes.  In our case, it allows us to provide hot meals and supports but the scheme will end eventually.  Many services are at that cliff edge.  We will not have funding to provide hot meals any more.  Services are facing closure, or they could have to restructure to the point where they will stop providing full-day care and the under-three places and move to a more sustainable model of sessional services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I need to move on to the next speaker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#J00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.

The figure that was mentioned was 5,000, but behind that are all the families who will be affected by those cuts, as well as those children's children when they grow up.  As I am sure has been mentioned, we need to acknowledge the intergenerational impact of poverty and social exclusion, which brings us to the point of these purposes.  Our guests have stressed they are not childcare and the wider role their services play in that equality, deprivation and anti-poverty work is very important.<\/p> <p>  We need specific and sustainable funding to be put in place without any gaps.

That relates to the holistic approach of community after-schools and the nuanced work that we do with children and their families.  We are often based in communities for a long time and so have built and developed relationships.  It takes trust and care to be able to ask parents to give information and support the work in that way, particularly for people who live in challenging circumstances or in communities that experience challenges with State agencies across the board and for all sorts of different reasons.

Families want to and are trying to do their best for children but if they must take the referral route they feel that they have left their children down.  That is not a reality but families have that feeling and there is a feeling of being stigmatised.  As a result, children do not necessarily get the supports they need.

Not just one community or one group of children are affected but more than 5,000 children nationally.<\/p> <p>  We must decide what we can do, as a committee, to address these matters.  I can see witnesses shaking their heads so there must have been no move made by the Department. <\/p> <p>  What does this situation say about childcare provision more broadly?  We have spoken about this aspect with Mr. Darragh O'Connor from SIPTU.  It is deeply frustrating to see that this situation is a consequence of the piecemeal provision of childcare, early years education and school age child care.  We have never had joined-up thinking and a coherent vision for early years education, after-school provision and the out-of-school supports that children require in order to enhance children's rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#K00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned targeted supports.  I think that targeted supports were created to support families.  A lot of services, especially in disadvantaged areas, have said that the removal of supports have had a detrimental impact.  We have expressed our concerns about the scheme to the Department and even prior to its launch we had a lot of concerns.  Now we are past breaking point.  The EWSS is covering the cracks at the moment and something needs to be done immediately to cover up the issue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the need for a child-centred approach, our most recent survey, in which 551 services participated, showed that only 4% of services felt that the NCS is child centred.  We need to ensure that any new funding model has children at its heart.  I acknowledge that there is a need to support working parents and equality.  Earlier, Mr. O'Connor and his colleague spoke, and SIPTU has its Big Start campaign, but we are talking about two halves of the same coin.  I mean that childcare policy has been looking at creative ways to stretch inadequate funding further but that has been to the detriment of the children, staff and services.<\/p><p>Realistically, as Mr. O'Connor said earlier, we need mass investment in the sector because we are at a crisis point and we are going to start going backwards.  For many years, as services that have been working with disadvantaged children and families, we have been talking about intergenerational change.  However, what is happening at the moment will undo decades of early intervention work whereby we have seen steady progress in families.  Studies have been done on the impact, including the intergenerational impact, of investment to tackle disadvantage.  It has supported not only the children but also the children of those children.  We need to realise, if we really want to deal with poverty, including intergenerational poverty, that it is a long-term game plan and we need to be setting the scene now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Ms Carey or Ms O'Connor, do either of you wish to come in briefly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#L00200","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Yes.

I have managed most things but co-location is not yet one of them.<\/p> <p>  I have a lot of gr&aacute; for Dublin 8.  I spent a lot of years working with an addiction service down there.  It was a really good service that also had an after-school and a preschool programme in it.  It took a holistic approach of developmental work whereby the developmental needs of both the parents and the child were captured under one roof.  I have seen the benefits of that over the years.  Only today I was talking to someone who was part of that programme and listening to how much that person and their family have progressed, so I absolutely see the need for these programmes.<\/p> <p>  My constituency, Dublin Mid-West, has some huge areas of disadvantage.  I am from an area of high disadvantage and I was one of the children who would have really benefited from having a school lunch.  I cannot put words on how much that would have benefited not just me but others.  There was no stigma around the disadvantage because we were all in the same boat.  The school lunch would have benefited me, my family, my neighbours and anybody I went to school with.  We mentioned only last week in the debate on child poverty how difficult it is for children to progress if they do not have food in their stomach and a winter jacket, basic needs that sometimes we take for granted.<\/p> <p>  As for school completion programmes or after-school programmes, we had in my area a really successful one that was closed two years ago.  I visited it just after I got elected.  It was an organisation called the Get Ahead Club.  It ran a really good programme.  Despite my pleas and other cross-party pleas to the former Minister, it closed.  It was one of those organisations whereby you see its benefits while it is there but you see the effects of not having something like it in your area only after it is gone.  After the funding ceased, the organisation was no longer there and that has left a big gap in my area.  It was literally only across the road from me.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the questions I was going to ask have been asked, so I will just touch on DEIS.  People mentioned the DEIS criteria.  I think it was mentioned that all children from marginalised and disadvantaged communities should have access to all community after-school projects in DEIS areas.  In one part of my constituency there are four primary schools, three of which have DEIS status and one of which does not.  I would not mind but the one that does not has in its catchment area some of the most disadvantaged areas and some of the highest levels of poverty across the whole constituency.  It just does not make sense to me that those kids are excluded.  I deal with the families.  Some have to get food from the local food bank.  They are trying to meet their kids' needs, and the fact that their school does not have DEIS status is really difficult.  Do the witnesses believe the DEIS criteria and eligibility need to be looked at?  Do they need to be widened?  What would the witnesses change in the current DEIS eligibility that would make the scheme easier for schools to access?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#L00400","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ward.

Everyone got those various pieces because of the DEIS model.  That is what we are saying.  We should not have a sponsorship model because this should involve everyone who comes from those communities of disadvantage in order that all children in those communities, or children in rural communities also coming from disadvantaged families, have access to those supports.  We do not want them to have to be individually referred.  We do not think that works.  There needs to be access for all.  The Deputy's comments on that part of his experience are very helpful.  The DEIS model is not perfect.  It is the best we have at the moment.  We are not saying we want to emulate it, but it is the structure that is there, so we can see something similar to it in an after-school context.

I am down on the Cork-Limerick border, and in our local town some schools have DEIS designation because the principals were very proactive at the time and got it.  The siblings of the children who go to that school go to a different school, where there are no such supports, so children can be left out.  In both rural and urban areas there are children and families who need particular supports.  They may not be in the catchment area of a DEIS school and may, therefore, have to travel outside of their community and away from their peers in order to be able to access services if they are to be found only under that model.  If, however, we restore access to targeted schemes or have a different type of process for children to engage in, we can, in the meantime, look at what innovative model we can get that does not exclude or stigmatise any child.  We do not need to piggyback on a model that does not cover that.  Mr. Kenny would say he is in an area that does not have DEIS designation but does have a significant level of disadvantage and a significant number of marginalised families.

I will not get into the ins and outs of which Minister then kicked it into action just before the last general election.  We are where we are.  In fairness, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has dealt with me on the issue.  A number of providers in my constituency are impacted by it, whether that is the service in Moneymore, Drogheda, the team project in Muirhevnamore, The House - Cox's Demesne or a number of other providers.  We have failed to put early intervention structures in place over many years.  We have also failed to deal with intergenerational deprivation.<\/p> <p>  This childcare model was working in a number of places.  We have now broken it.

If we can take a particular pot of money to deal with these sort of interventions that is great, but at this point in time we are where we are.

For most of the groups who have thought about using Tusla, it is a workaround.  I would be quite happy if we could get away with that workaround.  I understand most families do not want to touch Tusla.  There is probably an element of early interventions that should be removed from the same name as Tusla in its other role, that is when it is dealing with acute situations.  This is something that we have to look at into the future.  <\/p><p> We are where we are and Tusla is a means of referral.  I know that a number of groups were looking at possibly creating a meitheal and not wanting a full case with Tusla and the problem is that a directive has not come from Government, nor has a directive then come from Tusla to the groups as to how that roadmap would work.  I accept that it is imperfect but if we could do that until we see the outworkings of the review process, which I would like to think would put specific funding in place, we could then put a better model on the ground.  I am in agreement that Tusla is far from the body one would want to deal with as to referrals, but as I repeat myself, we are where we are and we need to get this interim solution in place so that organisations like these, and Hidden Treasures, Lios na n&Oacute;g and others in my constituency, do not go to the wall and that we do not fail the children who have failed to get into these groups in the past while<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#L00900","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Fundamentally, the issue with the NCS is that it is not child-centred and is not focusing on children&rsquo;s rights.  As we said in our opening statement, we have concerns that the whole ethos around the national childcare scheme is breaching the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child because Article 2 states that children should not be discriminated against based on the status of the parent.  Yet, with the NCS, we see children who, because of the employment status of the parent, are being treated differently, such as children of working parents.  My concern is that this scheme is broadening the gap between these children.  We have the children who can access our services simply because their parent is working or training but then we have children who cannot attend, get the hot meals, the homework support or the early intervention work.  This is going to be detrimental to those children and families.

While we might not agree with all aspects of this Bill, or indeed on terminology, we have found the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, willing to engage and to listen.<\/p> <p>  Our Adoptee Voices report is based on three surveys we conducted to illustrate the intergenerational impacts of the polices of forced and coercive adoption and how adoption has real life, ongoing, consequences for both adoptees and their families.  We are very strongly of the view that existing agencies are no longer fit for purpose and should be replaced by a new agency on the grounds of constitutional principles of fair procedures and centralisation.   Many of these concerns are largely practical ones and health concerns for both themselves and their families are a significant issue.  Adoptees may often be unaware that they have a full or half sibling who was also placed for adoption.  This is information that is rarely directly disclosed but rather discovered through file cross-referencing or commercial DNA testing.   <\/p> <p>  Our recommendations on terminology in the Adoptee Voices report was that research on this area should not be specific to one university but rather stakeholder-led.  Our concern with regard to terminology being academic-led is that it gives a proprietorial interest in an issue in which the acedemics are not direct stakeholders.  Given the historically privileged lens this issue has been viewed through, we feel that this approach is simply repeating the mistakes of the past.  Individual preferences as regards terminology are a deeply personal issue and this is generally reflective of a number of factors.  While there should always be scope within a personal context to respect preferred terms, the majority of respondents in our survey preferred the term \"birth mother\".  The terms \"first\", \"natural\" and \"real\" were not terms generally favoured.  Each of these terms are subjective and have a reverse implication as regards our adoptive families, as in: real-unreal, natural-unnatural, first-second.  Terms used in legislation must be exact, not subjective, emotive, open to interpretation or contradictory.<\/p> <p>  The theme of our report is having courage to face up to the past and the social harm that adoption has caused and to change it.  This courage needs to be coupled with the political will to transform, significantly, a deeply flawed construct that continues to impact negatively on the lives of adoptees and their children.<\/p> <p>  We would like to thank the committee staff for their assistance and the committee for the opportunity to discuss our report.

On terminology, the clear preference from the 200 people who replied to this question regarding preferred terms was for \"birth mother\" or \"birth father\", followed by \"mother\" or \"father\" and then an amalgamation of terms, such as \"birth mother\" or \"biological father\".  It will be appreciated that the issue around terms is sensitive.  Looking at this issue from an adoptee advocate perspective, the reason that the term \"birth mother\" is used is that for every other term there is an opposite that impacts negatively on our families, our adoptive families, who are recognised as our families in legislation.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty in this regard lies with balancing needs adequately.  I refer to the needs of birth parents and everyone else.  A point that came through strongly related to the stigma and shame.  Marginalisation also came across very clearly in respect of the feelings of adoptees.  We must understand how language feeds into that and how questioning the reality and naturalness of someone's family can impact negatively on adoptees.  I doubt if any members have been told that their father or mother is not their real mother or father, but it is not a pleasant position to be put in.  I do not think we should be continuing this practice in proposed legislation.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the term \"natural\", there is nothing progressive about it.  This term has been used in correspondence from the Adoption Board dating back to the 1980s.  Therefore, when we are looking at a transformative Bill that we hope will allow adoptees access to long-needed information, we also hope that it will look more constructively at the use of terms and the impact they have in this context.  We must understand and realise that adoptees and birth parents are all victims of this system and, consequently, we must have terms that are respectful of both.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the issue of the agency, perhaps Mr. O'Brien could answer that point more successfully, but there are issues concerning trust.  We felt that this would become a barrier to participation in respect of adoptees interacting with a new agency.  The model used when adoptees were spoken to regarding files was alarming and concerning.  This seemed to be a model of interaction rather than an isolated incident.  Given all these circumstances, we felt that it would be best to incorporate all the different facets of this one issue into one agency.

The balancing of rights is the elephant in the room when it comes to getting the legislation on adoption right and the information on tracing in that regard.  Most members of the committee will probably, with all the various representations made, be aware of the seminal case heard in the Supreme Court, namely, that of I.O'T <i>v<\/i>. B.  That was the case which identified the right to identity for adoptees and people generally.  It is an unenumerated personal right in the Constitution under Article 40.3.1&deg;.  Since then, the privacy of the birth mother has also been an issue and is also an unenumerated right under the same article.<br\/><br\/>The difficulty in the context of legislation has been to balance those rights.  Our contention and that of all adoptees is that the privacy of birth mothers has been given priority as a right over and above the constitutional right of identity.  That right is not only recognised in Ireland but it is also recognised under the European Convention on Human Rights and there is a great deal of case law on this matter.  Looking at this in stark terms, for legislators, it is a question of moving the balance in favour of adoptees.  If we think of this issue in the context of adoptees and their families, who in many cases do not have access to health information or do not even know their identity in terms of where they come from, this is something that legislators should consider thoroughly and seriously.<br\/><br\/>It is a practical issue when we think about questions such as &quot;Who am I?&quot; and &quot;Where do I come from?&quot;.  I remember that I gave a lecture many years ago in University College Dublin to approximately 250 nurses.  We spoke about this idea of freedom of information and accessing information in that regard.  A case was taken by an adoptee's daughter in a situation where her father had been born in the Rotunda Hospital.  He was in his 80s and in poor health.  He wanted to know who his mother was.  He sought that information from the Rotunda Hospital and it refused to release the information based on the right to privacy of the birth mother.  She was long dead at that time.  The court still maintained the aspect of privacy in that case.  The poor man went to his grave not knowing who he was or the identity of his birth mother.  When I mentioned that case in the lecture, I remember all 250 or so students gasping at the concept of not knowing who you are.  That is what lies at the heart of this issue.  I refer to the political will of legislators to look at rebalancing rights in this regard and to give priority to the right to identity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rody O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I apologise for interrupting, but we are under time pressure and I must move on to some of the other Senators because they are due to speak in the Seanad.

Will the witnesses elaborate on the general data protection regulation, GDPR, issues outlined in the report?  What can be done for adoptees to restore some faith in the agencies?

What actions can be taken now to restore some faith in that regard for adoptees and for mothers to enable them to trust the system?

One of the points from which we need to start, and I know this diverges somewhat from a social work model, is that we need to have engagement with people who are outside the remit of the commission.  Members might be able to get from the report a very clear sense of the frustration that is felt not just by people who were outside the remit of the commission but people who were in the remit but were unable to participate.  I recall that one respondent in particular said, &quot;I thought [that] when ... [my] home ... was included that I could go ... [and give evidence] to them&rdquo;, but that just did not happen.  Of all of the respondents to the survey, in which we asked questions about the commission, only 5% were able to take part in the commission's work, even though 50% were eligible to do so.  That is a rather stark percentage of people who could not engage on an issue by which they were directly affected.<br\/><br\/>We need to have pathways to participation for people who did not come not within the remit of the commission and who could not be included.  We will begin to see this in a more holistic approach whereby we understand that it is the case that not every home was included under the commission's remit and not every adoptee came through a home.  We need<b><\/b>people to see the matter in a holistic way - as part of a larger issue.  That would be the first step.<br\/><br\/>The second step is that there needs to be an immediate review of social work practices within Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  What we came across in the context of our research was across the board, with every agency, from people who interacted with us who were adopted.  There was a stark contrast with regard to people who were, say, the children of adoptees; there did not seem to be as much invasiveness, as I would describe it, for them when it came to accessing information.  If we were to look at it as a learning process, not just for society at large as to what the experiences of adoptees are but also with regard to the social work model and how that can be improved, there is a great deal that can be learned from this and much of the research we carried out can be of benefit.  We really need to see that being taken on board and there must be an acknowledgment of where there have been shortcomings.  Obviously, our long-term gain, which I hope will not be too long arriving, would come in the form of a new agency.  I will let Mr. O'Brien take over as regards the GDPR aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I will come in on two points as regards the GDPR and I will then look at the issue of the agency if the Vice Chairman has time to facilitate that.  Up until now, the GDPR and data protection have been used as a restriction to getting information on a person's identity.  We are restricted in that and, therefore, they are restricted in the context of their constitutional right to identity.  The GDPR is basically being used as an excuse in that regard.  It is kind of an <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>interpretation of the GDPR from what I can see, particularly in the context of the proposed legislation, a matter to which we refer to in our report as well.<br\/><br\/>Adoptees have the right, under Article 15 of the GDPR, to access information of which they are the subject.  That is one particular aspect, but I would also like to highlight an important part of the GDPR that is really significant.  Article 49 of the GDPR involves a derogation in specific circumstances.  This allows an organisation and, therefore, in this instance, the State, when legislators are legislating for access to information in the proposed new Bill, the right to information to be refused.  In our view, that represents a way around any restrictions that are put up as obstacles and the issue of privacy rights of other parties.  It is really down to what we perceive as the political will to give priority to the right of identity to adoptees, which have always taken second place to the rights of privacy of the birth mother.  It is then really a matter of political will as to how the Government wants to proceed.<br\/><br\/>That is the position on the GDPR.  I am conscious of time.

I am willing to elaborate later if anyone wants to ask me about it.<\/p> <p>  Senator McGreehan asked about the significant issue of restoring faith or trust.  There is a legal problem.  Many members will understand this from experience.  Senator Seery Kearney, who is a barrister, would know about this particularly well.  There is an issue with regard to the constitutional rights of fair procedure, especially where a case has been judged previously, in the context of getting a fair hearing.  The idea of bias in a case is an aspect of constitutional justice.  If somebody has already sat on a decision to give a person information or decided to withhold information that person's identity, there is a constitutional issue as regards allowing them to revisit the matter.  Allowing agencies to revisit issues in respect of which they have already sat, gives rise to issues of either actual bias or perception of bias.  The latter can open up major issues going forward.  Apart from the trust issue and the legalities of judicial review, everything will end up being judicially reviewed all over the place.  It is, therefore, a very unsatisfactory purpose.  There is a really strong case for a new agency on the basis of the legal and constitutional issues involved.  That is a very brief response on that issue.

As regards scholarships, we feel very strongly that when provision is being made for scholarships or educational supports, these really need to be delivered to the communities that have suffered as a result of these systems.  When one reads a report from the children of adoptees, it is very clear how this has impacted on them.  It indicates that this trauma dissipates and ripples through generations.  Previous speakers spoke about intergenerational poverty.  There is no quantifiable research as yet on how this has impacted in an intergenerational sense, but we are certainly getting a view of how this has affected the children of adoptees.  This cohort is largely ignored.  If it is recommended there will be scholarships, then they will need to be specifically delivered to the communities who need them.  The Senator spoke about the wider communities in the context of institutional abuse and the institutions at large.  Certainly, these scholarships need to go to the communities.  Very often, the underprivileged and those who have come through institutions and mother and baby homes are the same communities that this trauma has rippled through and affected.  We need to have those educational supports.<\/p><p>We also need to make the point that both adoptees and survivors should be empowered to be educated on the subject at university.  We call on any universities, colleges etc., which have this as an area of study, to provide scholarships to these communities to enable adoptees and survivors to be educators about their own history.  It is clear from the report that the larger societal context of this as an issue is understood.  We understand the significance of it and we appreciate our own role as custodians of our own history.  We need to be able to be empowered doing that as opposed to being muted or, again, treated as objects of study.<\/p><p> I will let Mr. O&rsquo;Brien take over on the second part, which is oversight.  However, we have made a call in the report for a review of legislation.  We feel it is important to have oversight as regards the legislation, because of what happened with the previous Act in 1952, which was largely left in abeyance.  Apart from amendments, it has never been substantively changed.  We, therefore, need a review built into the birth information and tracing Bill 2021, so that there will be a review of legislation, in either two or three years, to see what has worked and what has not, and to amend the legislation accordingly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Ms Ryan-O&rsquo;Brien has covered the point.

I, too, want to compliment them on the report.  I say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to everyone involved.  It is critical that we read the report and that we listen to what people are saying.  That is what we need to do.  It was vital to hear about the shame and stigma felt by the adoptees.  It is so important that we know we listen to people.  In my own area of Carlow-Kilkenny, people have contacted me who have found it difficult.  We have to mindful of that.  The Department has established in information management unit, but I have suggested that we ought to look at a liaison officer, maybe through a local authority or the HSE.  Do the witnesses think that it would be beneficial to have a local person or office, where adopted people could go in order to access information, or to have support in tracing their records?<\/p> <p>  The other issue relates to the barriers to how information is provided, for example, in the cases of people who may have literacy difficulties or maybe someone who has an intellectual disability.

Maybe one of the witnesses could come back to me on that.  I was going to ask about GDPR but I got the answer to that.

One of the first steps we took as a group was that we liaised with local county councils through our supporting motions.  We secured unanimous support of 20 county councils for supporting motions for open access for adoptees for their own information.  In so doing, we created awareness in local authorities around this area.  I feel that there would be a lot of support and willingness on behalf of some of these local authorities to educate and support people who are looking for information.  The most practical way forward would be what we recommended, namely, an agency to centralise all of these issues.  We touched on that with regard to the information units within the Minister&rsquo;s Department.  We felt that it made far more sense to house all of that information in one agency, rather than having it on a piecemeal basis in different Departments.  There should be the same standard of access for all people who wants to access information, whether they are an adoptee or a families.  Everyone should have the same standard of access, as opposed to there being a differentiation in that regard.  Overall, the best way to achieve that, so as to support survivors, adoptees and birth parents, is to have a centralisation of all of these issues within one agency.  Then, from that, we should have specific outreaches, in order that people could liaise with the agency on somebody's behalf if there are mobility issues, access issues, or literacy issues.  We have also asked that people who have literacy issues, which the Deputy touched on, might be permitted to make video submissions or video requests, as opposed to having to write them.<\/p><p>That is something we could look at in a more humanist approach to an improved social work model within a new agency.  It has proved to be very onerous and it causes a lot of stress, certainly for elderly survivors who are trying to access information.  It was something they were not able to do and they then had to ask somebody to help them, which they were quite distressed about because they had to tell somebody about the background or tell their story.  We need to look at it on a practical level and also be very aware of the demographic, the age and the profile of people who are looking for information and to build on that.<\/p><p> I feel there is a willingness in the Minister's Department to listen to all of these points.

I know that is a big question but it is a very pressing issue for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#Q00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>It was clear from the findings of the report that the preferred term was &quot;birth parent&quot;, &quot;birth mother&quot; or &quot;birth father&quot;.  I suppose, for the sake of brevity, it makes sense that &quot;birth parent&quot; was used.  Personally, I use &quot;birth mother&quot; and &quot;biological father&quot;.  I know the third preference in our survey was for an amalgam of both,&quot;birth mother and biological father&quot;.  The second preference was &quot;biological mother and biological father&quot;.  As a general term, &quot;birth parent&quot; would probably sit easily.<br\/><br\/>On the far more complex issue of trust, it is quite difficult to restore trust in a system that is inherently flawed and has continually denied access to information.  I know we have spoken about this issue over recent years when the Deputy was a Member of the Seanad, debating previous Bills and so on.  It is the case there is no trust with regard to Tusla and there is no trust with regard to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and that is very clear.  There were 468 respondents to the main survey, the identity rights for adoptees survey.  Two of those could have been positive where there were different circumstances, but the vast majority were negative.  Again, there is the issue of adoptees being spoken to over files, or having files on the table in front of them while they were spoken over.  It is much more like an interrogation technique than a supportive technique.<br\/><br\/>If we are talking about restoring trust, that would be a very difficult ask because it is clear it is gone.  I really do not know how we would restore trust in it except by being open and accepting the difficulties it has caused, the pain and upset it has caused the people who have been on the receiving end of this, the stigmatisation it has caused, the marginalisation they have felt as a result of it and the strain it has put on people's mental health.  That should be very clear.  When people are telling us in the report they felt criminalised having an interaction with the agencies they are meant to be supported by, I really do not see how there is a comeback from that.<br\/><br\/>If we are to frame what I believe the Minister hopes is transformative legislation, the only way we can do this successfully is in a new agency with a clean start, a <i>tabula rasa<\/i>, which we were given when we were adopted in that we were wiped clean, we had no past.  The same approach needs to be taken with regard to an agency.  We need a fresh start.  We need a clean break from the past.  We cannot keep repeating the same issues because we see now how this impacts, how this hurts, how this goes through generations, and we need at some stage for this to stop.  It needs to stop.  To do that, we need to move away from agencies with which there are massive issues, such as legal issues and issues in regard to the end users, who at this stage do not trust them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":309,"content":"<p>As Vice Chairman, I am in the unenviable position that most of the questions I was going to ask have already been asked.

This is so important.  As the committee will understand, it is not always a given.  It makes trying to influence legislation and actually have something that delivers for everybody much easier.<\/p> <p>  That said, we are dealing with a situation where the effects of this issue have become compounded over generations.  It has become an intergenerational issue with regard to adoptees and their children.  Health concerns are massive with regard to how this impacts not on just adoptees ourselves but on our children with regard to health supports.  We have made a very clear list of recommendations and we need to start at No. 1 and work our way through that.<\/p> <p>  The first recommendation was that we need to look at how we bring in people who were not included within the remit of the commission.  There are massive acknowledged issues with regard to the commission, the way it was conducted, the way everything transpired, the report itself, the way the witnesses were treated and the way data were stored, but there are still thousands of people who are directly affected who have had no pathway to inclusion at all - nothing.  How do we bridge that gap?  How do we bring people on board?  If we want to do that, if we want to look at it very constructively, if we want to look at how we might be able to do that, we need to sit down within that construct of a model of participation and look at issues like terminology.<\/p> <p>  I am fully aware of the issues regarding birth parents and the sensitivity around that.  Adoptees and birth mothers are all victims.<\/p><p>We are both victims.  It is like two sides of the same coin.  We need to have a level of understanding.  I am very optimistic about the need for engagement and understanding of everybody else's perspective in order that we can work towards something that is inclusive and look at a new terminology on it instead of rehashing what has gone before.

He is very genuine and has a very strong sense of decency about how he is approaching legislation.  We appreciate this.  It is a great opportunity for everybody to try, once and for all if there is the political will that we discussed earlier, to prioritise the adoptee and to give adoptees their identity rights as provided for in the Constitution.

How should the State apologise in the correct way to everybody who has been a victim of this?  Ms Ryan-O'Brien said in her contribution that both adoptees and mothers are victims in this story.  How does the State apologise for this?<\/p> <p>  The report speaks about language, terminology and attitudes.

They felt it did not sufficiently address it as an issue and it was not cognisant of the fact that a significant portion of people were unable to participate due to the limited remit.  This was not that Government's issue as the Taoiseach was not in government when the commission was set up.  The recommendation we make is that it needs to be revisited, that it needs to be done in a broader sense and that it needs to be more inclusive.  Doing what happened created an artificial stratification of the issue.  There were people within the remit and people not within the remit and there were also people who were illegally adopted.  All of these people have suffered.  Birth parents have suffered, adoptees have suffered and survivors have suffered.  This needs to be addressed as one holistic issue.  I hope the participation model, what shape it could take and how it should be delivered would be discussed and that there would be input from everybody.  The only way we can move towards healing is if we can address these shortcomings and if people feel as if they are being heard and can move on from it.  Very much at the core of restorative justice is identifying the harm and repairing it.  The harm has not been repaired.  The harm has been compounded, ignored and muted.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the language, we use the example in the report of a sentence said by the former Minister, Katherine Zappone.  I was not singling her out in any way.  It was simply one that stuck in my mind at that time.  She spoke about protecting a small cohort of potentially vulnerable birth parents.  Within this was the inference that adoptees were a threat.  We need to look at how language has damaged and marginalised.  Even if we go back through transcripts of debates in the past, it is very clear that adoptees were presented as a threat and as people who would impinge upon the privacy of another person.<\/p> <p>  There is also the language around words like \"real\", \"unreal\", \"natural\", \"first\" and so on.  This further contributes to marginalisation from an adoptee's perspective.  This is why I feel the language around this needs to be further developed and explored outside of what it is at present into more inclusive terms that are mindful of everybody's position and feelings and are respectful of them.  The shame and stigma felt by adoptees, and the feelings and depth of feelings as regards marginalisation, being ignored, being overlooked and not quite fitting in, have not been in any way addressed or identified.  They seem to be largely misunderstood or not understood at all.  One respondent described it as being a square peg in a round hole.  People are looking for mirroring or a biological connection that is not there.  Being mindful of all of these issues and the extensive recommendations we have made in the report, we need to take all of them on board and have a model of participation that brings all of these diverse opinions on board.  This is very clearly outlined by Dr. Marder in our report.  Having a more holistic, broader, accurate and inclusive view of what happened in the past will allow us to move towards the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2021100500002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maree Ryan-O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ryan-O'Brien.

I will first consider some of the systemic issues that negatively impact on the curriculum reform projects.  The first such issue is investment in education.  The OECD Education at a Glace 2020 report once again ranked Ireland at the bottom of 36 countries in investment in second-level education as a percentage of GDP.<\/p><p>This leads to poorly resourced and overcrowded schools that are unsuitable and hinder the delivery of a broad and flexible curriculum.  <\/p><p> The second point relates to teacher supply.  A key issue is the high costs of initial teacher training.  Currently, the two-year postgraduate masters in education programme costs between &euro;11,000 and &euro;14,000.  The high costs of initial teacher education constitute one of the reasons for a lack of diversity in the teaching profession.  The third point involves the attractiveness of teaching as a profession.  Unequal pay is having a corrosive impact on the profession.  Negative media commentary and ill-founded expectations of the work of teachers and schools damage morale.  <\/p><p> There are four areas the committee wants us to examine.  Regarding assessment options, the NCCA&rsquo;s review of senior cycle has identified three major problems.  They are the timing of the assessment, the range of assessment types and the balance of marks awarded to written and practical components.  What is not identified as problematic is the externally assessed nature of the examination.  The strengths of the leaving certificate include a high level of public trust, its capacity to serve as a valid and objective statement of students' academic achievement and its fairness, impartiality and transparency.  The core problem is the fact that the leaving certificate examination is the sole pathway for school leavers to higher education.  <\/p><p> The second point involves key subject areas and digital learning.  The shift to remote teaching during the past 20 months has demonstrated both the potential and limitations of digital learning.  Digital literacy is more than knowing how to use digital technology for learning.  It encompasses social and cultural skills, critical thinking and understanding bias to enable young people to participate fully and ethically in a digitalised social world.  The key challenges are ensuring equal access to broadband and digital devices, teacher professional learning, whole-school policies and dedicated leadership posts.<\/p><p> The third point involves access, equality and well-being supports.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 ensures equal access but does not address the ongoing problems in the capacity of schools.  The NCSE and the Department must engage with schools to ensure schools have an adequate teaching and SNA allocation and suitable accommodation and specialist facilities.  The well-being policy statement and framework for practice is largely aspirational, as it is not supported by counselling and psychological services.  Students with emotional and behavioural disorders represent the majority of students with special educational needs.  <\/p><p> The fourth point concerns Irish language and Irish medium education.  The hugely positive impact of the Gaeltacht experience on attitudes to the language should be harnessed.  Grants must be made available to educationally disadvantaged students to attend Gaeltacht summer courses.  Student teachers should also receive grants to meet the cost of their mandatory Gaeltacht placement.  Serving teachers should be assisted to attend Gaeltacht courses to upskill.  Is &iacute; aidhm Polasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta 2017&ndash;2022 n&aacute; tac&uacute; le pobal Gaeltachta in &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge mar theanga chumars&aacute;ide.

Teachers will engage with change when they are convinced of its necessity and rationale and when they believe it will enhance students' learning and achievement.  Insufficient attention is paid to systemic issues impacting on teaching and learning.  Underinvestment impacts on teachers' working conditions and workload.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Dennehy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Jones to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#J00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to address them and contribute to the wider debate on the leaving certificate.

In that respect, proposed changes or reform of the leaving certificate have implications across all levels and for all who work in that system.  I am here today as a member and a representative of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions education sector group, which comprises a number of affiliate unions with membership across primary, second and third level, further education and lifelong learning, some of which are represented today.<\/p><p> The congress education sector group is focused on working to ensure the education system as a whole is suitably purposed, structured and resourced to deliver high-quality learning for students at all levels and high-quality standards of employment for all staff, and to play a key role in the achievement of greater equality, opportunity and social progress.  My own union, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, IFUT, represents staff across the university sector, and that perspective informs my views on the matter.  However, IFUT has not made a submission to the committee in its own right on this occasion.<\/p><p> It is clear that what happens at higher level and the level of the leaving certificate is of direct import to those who work in that area.  In addition, I stress that the congress education sector group obviously shares the concerns voiced by our colleague unions here today, including what has been expressed by the student unions today.  From that perspective, there are some observations we can contribute to the debate on the matter.<\/p><p> An essential starting point for any such process is that we have or develop an agreed vision on the values and ethos that should underpin our education system and, by extension, on the role, purpose and core function of the leaving certificate within the context of the wider education system.  Any proposed changes should occur only with full consultation and dialogue and such changes should be clearly evidence-based.  A fundamental prerequisite of any review or process of change must be that the systematic underfunding in the education sector as a whole be finally addressed, as evidenced repeatedly by the OECD and as referred to by my ASTI colleague.<\/p><p> We acknowledge that, relative to a range of alternatives, the current leaving certificate system has an inherent fairness and the model of external assessment has helped establish a strong degree of public trust.  I stress that any mooted changes to assessment structures must not simply result in extra pressure and stress being placed on students and staff alike.  It is also clear the leaving certificate must be sufficiently robust and responsive to reflect changes in wider society and to cater to the evolving learning needs of students.  In this respect, we must aim to ensure the development of critical thinking, and this can only evolve where there is sufficient subject knowledge.  As such, the leaving certificate must be capable of ensuring the full range of a student's learning can be substantiated and validated.  Finally and crucially, we must also work to ensure all educational pathways are equally regarded and esteemed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste as ucht na deise teacht ina l&aacute;thair inniu agus labhairt ar son Chumann M&uacute;inteoir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  The INTO is the oldest and largest teachers' trade union in Ireland and represents almost 50,000 teachers at both primary and post-primary level across 32 counties.  Today we wish to address access, equality and well-being supports, particularly those relating to the education of pupils in special schools.  We will also comment briefly on the Irish language and Irish medium education.<\/p> <p>There are in excess of 3,300 primary schools on the Department of Education database and, of these, 133 are special schools.  Special schools have been designated traditionally as primary schools by the Department, and the INTO represents most teachers teaching in these special schools.  Many special schools enrol pupils from age four up to the age of 18, teach both the primary and post-primary curricula, and provide access to State examinations at both junior and senior cycle for their pupils where appropriate and possible.<\/p> <p>  In making this submission, the INTO is calling for continuity of curriculum experience in as far as is possible for all pupils as they navigate their way through our school system.  We support the holistic development of the child, as is evidenced in the current and upcoming primary school curriculum and as promoted at junior cycle in post-primary schools.  The approaches to curriculum, assessment and pedagogy in the early years, primary level and at junior cycle level reflect the societal aim of facilitating every child to reach his or her full potential.<\/p> <p>  We also recognise national and international trends towards the development of skills and competencies rather than more traditional content-based curricula.<\/p><p>It is widely acknowledged that a skills and competencies based curriculum would better prepare the pupil of today for living, working and engaging with the social and employment opportunities of tomorrow.<\/p><p> We recognise that all pupils with special educational needs should be enabled to access education in settings appropriate to their needs.  The INTO acknowledges the support provided by National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in developing the well-being supports that are available on the Department's website.  However, it is also important that students should have access to therapeutic, socio-emotional and counselling support in the school setting.  These supports are required from early years right up to senior cycle.<\/p><p> We also hold the position that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, should be entitled to access national certification for their educational achievements.  We commend the development by the NCCA of level 1, L1, and level 2, L2, learning programmes at junior cycle level.  As part of the process of senior cycle and leaving certificate reform, we are calling for the development of age-appropriate curricula and learning programmes at senior cycle level that would allow the pupils catered for by L1 and L2 learning programmes at junior cycle to access certification to acknowledge their educational achievements.  Therefore, additional courses at level 1 and level 2 will be required.<\/p><p> We acknowledge that this will require a wider variety of assessment methodologies, which are more compatible with the needs and abilities of this cohort of pupils than the current terminal examination which can exclude many students with special needs attending special schools or classes in our education system.  This certification should take account of the fact that not all students may wish to access third level education and will take different paths into the post-school world of work and other activities.<\/p><p> Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focail a r&aacute; faoi nGaeilge agus an teanga.  We are aware that the question of the Irish language at leaving certificate and Irish medium education is topical and complex.  We believe that in an inclusive education system, Irish at senior cycle should be inclusive of the diversity of needs, including those with special needs, those whose mother tongue is Irish and those receiving education tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  These students require access to assessment and certification which reflects their needs and abilities.  We recommend that pupils of all abilities and levels of competence should be entitled to the development of their mother tongue, whichever language this may be.  We believe that this reflects the Government's policies on languages - Languages Connect: Ireland's Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017-2026.  Mar fhocail scoir: any reform of the senior cycle must reflect the diversity of pupils, their needs, abilities and learning styles.  The singular focus of senior cycle must not be access to third level education only, but must focus on a variety of pathways to lifelong learning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>As the national representative body for the second level students of Ireland, one of the core elements of our work is ensuring that students remain as core stakeholders in the decisions that affect them.  We strive to represent, uplift and defend the student voice.  When given the opportunity to present on an issue, we are always willing to work to find the solution.  It is in this spirit that I present before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The leaving certificate is a national affair.  The examination makes front page news on an annual basis.  All major national media outlets cover stories about the top achievers, emerging trends, the numbers of students seeking university admission.  However, it should not be so controversial.  The leaving certificate should merely be a mechanism for recognising students' learning outcomes in a fair manner at the end of second level education.  So, one could ask why it attracts so much attention.  No matter who you speak to about the leaving certificate examination, there is an almost perfect consensus that the system is in need of reform and that it has been for quite some time.  The leaving certificate is almost a century old, yet those who sat the first examination would struggle to see a difference today.  Some 51.6% of senior cycle students felt the leaving certificate did not accurately reflect their work over fifth and sixth year as per the ISSU's senior cycle report.  We at the ISSU believe that the voices and experiences of students must be at the heart of the reform.  After two years of not carrying out the traditional leaving certificate examination, students' voices are clear - change is needed now.<\/p> <p>  This morning, I would like to make three submissions to the committee from the perspective of the second level students of Ireland.  The first is that assessment methods need to change in order to accommodate more diverse skills of students, and with an aim to alleviate the stress that is created by a high-pressure examination schedule at the end of two years of education.<\/p><p>We need to space out exams and even have separate examination periods in order to reduce undue pressure on students&rsquo; health and well-being.  We need to promote more diverse examination and assessment methods, other than terminal exams which test fact regurgitation and the ability to write under time pressure.  Additionally on this point, we note the current structure of senior cycle examinations particularly favours students with access to private tutoring services over students who do not.  We need to implement assessments throughout the leaving certificate cycle that capture and reward students&rsquo; diverse learning abilities, and not just their memory.<\/p><p> Second, access routes to higher education must be addressed in an holistic way alongside discussion of examination reform and more investment to promote equality.  The ISSU notes that Ireland ranks 38th out of the 38 OECD member countries on educational spending.  We need to overhaul the points system, alongside an overhaul of the assessment methods, to allow students to gain points through a variety of assessment opportunities.  We need to allow students to gain points and other forms of recognition through extracurricular achievements when applying to further and higher education programmes.  We need to greatly increase the number of university admission places through access routes and normalise post-leaving certificate courses, apprenticeship programmes and other forms of further and higher education.<\/p><p> On the subject of an Ghaeilge agus oideachas tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, further curricular reform is necessary in order to increase emphasis on oral Irish.  The ISSU believes curricular reform that promotes the use of Irish as a living language would be beneficial and welcomed by students.  From our consultations, students have expressed a strong preference for oral Irish, and learning to use the language in daily life, rather than an over-emphasis on poetry and more complex literature.  Additionally, students noted that where young people exemplify a strong interest in Irish or, specifically, for students attending Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, novels, prose and poetry studies, these should be offered as optional additional subjects.  However, daily use and ability to speak Irish with confidence should remain at the forefront of learning outcomes for senior cycle Irish education.<\/p><p> In conclusion, based on feedback, consultations and a recent leaving certificate reform report carried out by the ISSU, it is clear to us that students do not want a return to a traditional leaving certificate.  We can no longer continue to put plasters on a completely broken system.  The solution is clear and it lies in the complete overhaul of the leaving certificate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Emer Neville","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":332,"content":"<p>The Teachers&rsquo; Union of Ireland, TUI, has engaged extensively in the senior cycle review process with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the State Examinations Commission, the OECD and our members - all 20,000 of them.  The review of senior cycle is an opportunity for the political system to respond positively to the TUI&rsquo;s call for an adequately funded and high-quality public education system that caters for the needs of a very diverse student body.<\/p> <p>  The TUI&rsquo;s position is clear and unambiguous: State certification enjoys public trust.  TUI members are fundamentally opposed to assessing their own students for State certification.  External assessment by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, must be retained.  Changes to assessment models must be based on sound educational principles rather than the unreliable weathervane of populist commentary.  Throughout the Covid-19 crisis TUI members have been engaging with emergency assessment processes on a strictly without-precedent basis so that final year students could progress to the next stage of their lives.<\/p> <p>  Continuous assessment, CA, is sought by some commentators.  Our schools already use such assessment.  Formative assessment, by its nature, is continuous and enhances teaching and learning.  Moving to a CA model for State certification purposes, however, would be counterproductive.  It would increase - not reduce - stress for students and teachers, inevitably lead to over-assessment, compromise objective standards and undermine public trust.  Furthermore, it would fundamentally and negatively change the pupil-teacher relationship, possibly removing the emphasis on the supportive aspect of the relationship.<\/p> <p>  The excessive focus on CAO points is not a product of the leaving certificate.  The CAO runs a separate process that allots places in higher education that is superimposed on the leaving certificate.  The CAO points race is a reflection of a media obsession with progression to third level and with high-points courses.  The points race leads to invalid and unfair comparisons.  Changing leaving certificate assessment modes to tackle the CAO points race would be to base change on a misdiagnosis of the real problem.<\/p> <p>   Senior cycle subjects are continually evolving.  Most already have additional components of assessment, involving project, oral and practical work, that is set, administered and examined by the SEC.  The TUI has called for continuous assessment every year, thereby reducing the pressure in sixth year.<\/p><p>Every subject and programme has intrinsic value.  Senior cycle should continue to be broad based as this best prepares learners for life and active citizenship and best anticipates an ever-changing society where complex challenges, global and personal, abound.<\/p><p> From time to time, certain disciplines may be considered especially important, by governments or employers.  However such perceived hierarchies are often transient in nature.  Reform of the senior cycle must be inclusive and must cater for all students and their varied talents.  Therefore, the ring-fencing of leaving certificate applied, LCA, must be removed so that students can undertake a mix of subjects that would enable them to move directly into apprenticeships.  Equally, the vocational subject groupings associated with the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, need to be amended or abolished.<\/p><p> Given the relentless developments in technology, ongoing review of the Government&rsquo;s strategy is critical to facilitating the appropriate integration of new technologies as supports for teaching and learning for 21st century competencies.  Significant investment is urgently needed.<\/p><p> Schools rely on support agencies, especially when working with students experiencing crisis.  However, schools often find it difficult to access support because those agencies are under pressure.  Most schools make every effort to create an inclusive environment for all learners, regardless of their backgrounds or aptitudes.  Targeted investment, especially more teachers to reduce class sizes, would greatly assist this effort.  The depletion of middle management posts since 2009 has resulted in a damaging reduction in support for students.  The extra teachers provided to schools during the Covid-19 crisis should be retained tin order o enable schools to provide subject and programme choice at appropriate levels and to ensure well-being.<\/p><p> Meaningful curricular provision must be made for students with special and additional educational needs who took L1 and L2 learning programmes for junior cycle and who wish to proceed to senior cycle education.<\/p><p> In the context of leaving certificate Irish, the TUI believes: that foundation level must be retained; that the oral and aural components should retain their existing proportion of marks; that the draft learning outcomes require significant development; and if a T1-T2 approach is to be introduced and especially if bonus points are contemplated, that every school must be assisted to provide T1 because, otherwise, a new layer of disadvantage will be created.<\/p><p> I thank members for listening to the views of the profession.  In its full submission to the committee, the TUI has set out its position in regard to senior cycle reform more extensively and has included a set of recommendations for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gillespie","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the joint committee for this opportunity.  My name is Clare Austick and I am president of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI.<\/p> <p>  It must be noted that USI&rsquo;s core mission has always been to protect the access to education, ensure equal opportunities for all and remove any barriers that prevent the pursuing of a third level degree.  Unfortunately, the leaving certificate in its current form has prevented far too many students from entering their preferred course due to the unjust points system which acts as an entry examination into college.  The current assessment criteria are very restrictive and do not allow the student to excel and meaningfully demonstrate his or her knowledge on a particular topic.  The leaving certificate is often based on a single written examination which essentially tests the student&rsquo;s memory and ability to retain information on one particular day.  This results in enormous pressure and stress placed on a student to perform.  Many students fall ill, have personal circumstances arise, have family bereavements or bad days remembering course material.  We all have good and bad days, yet the leaving certificate, which is such a significant milestone in a person&rsquo;s life, does not take this into consideration.<\/p> <p>  Students should be supported to illustrate their knowledge through a mechanism which enhances and showcases their strengths in the subject matter at hand rather than confirming the student&rsquo;s ability to retain and convey material learnt off by heart.  Assessment options must be more flexible and supportive, and capable of accommodating the diverse skills of the student.  This should in our view be around continuous assessment options, presentations, group work, practical work, class discussions, multiple choice questions and asking the student how they would like to display their knowledge.<\/p><p>An essential part of this discussion is around the multiplicity of methods of teaching in the modern classroom.  The teaching and learning environment must adopt a universal design for learning approach to ensure every student can fully and meaningfully participate and engage in class.<\/p><p> Covid-19 has certainly brought many advantages in the area of digital learning and making education more accessible and flexible.  The move to digital learning for accessibility purposes is welcomed but we must bridge the digital divide to ensure all students have equal opportunities and access to learning materials.  Not every student has a laptop, a strong Wi-Fi connection or the technology and software needed to engage in an online hybrid model.  We need State funding to support students from deprived backgrounds and low-income households to ensure that no one is put at a disadvantage.<\/p><p> Every person regardless of their age, personal circumstances, financial background and journey should be able to enter into third level education if it is their desire to do so.  Alternative education pathways need to be supported and developed.  Not every leaving certificate student wants to go to college.  A post-leaving certificate, PLC, course, apprenticeship, entry into the workforce and taking a year out for self-development can each be equally valuable.  However, the alternative options to third level education are often deprecated and seen as a lesser back-up plan for students who \"fail\" to earn the points necessary to secure a place on their chosen course. <\/p><p> Each person has different interests, skills and ambitions in their life.  A hierarchy of approved pathways through lifelong learning benefits no one.  Furthermore, investment into DEIS schools is crucially important.  Outreach initiatives and programmes should be developed and encouraged to ensure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds continue on their educational journey. <\/p><p> The mental health and well-being of students must always inform every important decision taken.  The leaving certificate places undue stress and pressure on students and impacts on their mental health throughout the year.  Awareness of this stress and anxiety on students needs to be included to support students throughout the leaving certificate process. <\/p><p> In conclusion I would like all present to take a moment to reflect on their experience with the leaving certificate examinations.  Members should think about how many students have not been able to excel and reach their full potential under this flawed system.  How many could not access their preferred course because they did not get the points, or how many did not even consider college in the first place?  How many went into the exams fearful and thinking that possible failure was the end of a journey rather than the opening of a new chapter in their lives?  I ask members to look to the future to think about how many more students will be left behind with the leaving certificate if it remains the same as it is now? <\/p><p> The people on this committee can change that.  They can ensure that each learner can participate fully in their class, is freed to showcase their strengths and can take the decision to access third level education if they want to.  This conversation today is the beginning and the opening of an opportunity to shape our educational landscape for years to come.

Like last week, Chairman, I can confirm that I am in Leinster House.<\/p> <p>I thank all of our witnesses very much for their presentations which I found very interesting.  I will make a number of points and perhaps our witnesses can respond to them.  <\/p> <p>  On teacher training, we do not have a very diverse teaching profession.  I do not know how many teachers we have from ethnic backgrounds, from disadvantaged areas, or from the Traveller community but teaching is one of these professions which is ground-breaking and life-changing.   The role model of being a teacher in a classroom is particularly powerful.  I am wondering, and I have spoken to many different agencies about this, including the Teaching Council, as to how we can facilitate a mechanism of getting more teachers from diverse backgrounds into the teaching profession.  I suggest that we should be as imaginative as possible.  <\/p> <p>  If one is a primary school teacher, the Irish language is a particular requirement and that is completely understandable and justifiable.  It would probably make more sense, however, to have the ability to teach Irish as something that one would train for in training college rather than being the pre-eminent barrier or requirement in order to become a primary school teacher.  If one is not Irish or comes from an area that does not provide higher-level Irish in one's secondary school, that is an issue and it is therefore a barrier.  I spent some time as a substitute teacher in a particular second level school in a disadvantaged area and higher-level Irish was not offered.<\/p><p>How can those children become primary school teachers?  It is therefore a barrier.<\/p><p> The Education (Admission to Schools) Act was referred to earlier.  Next month, we will have a review of the provision in the Act allowing schools to reserve 25% of places for the children or grandchildren of past pupils.  I assume all the witnesses consider that provision to be regressive and unequal, and needs to be removed.<\/p><p> I agree with what has been said on educational funding.  Far too many conversations take place in education about money.  It dominates many relationships.  Parents associations are basically asked to be fundraising committees.  Parents here are asked to pay for books, which they are not asked to do in Northern Ireland.  I take issue with voluntary contributions.  Schools believe they have to ask for them because if they do not, they cannot put the lights on.  We need to move to a situation in which parents, teachers and principals do not feel compelled to have conversations around money all the time.  Students certainly should not be asked for money.  What are the views of the witnesses, particularly those representing the second level unions, on the banning of voluntary contributions?<\/p><p> On the leaving certificate, do we not all believe that if we do not grab this opportunity now, it will not come up again?  It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change this system.  I do not know about anyone else's experience, but I am haunted by the leaving certificate I did in 1994, and I am 45 years of age.  Sometimes the sentiment of people in Ireland is that they went through it, so there.  In many of today's presentations, we heard that the leaving certificate is trusted, transparent and so on but it is damaging many young people.  Some 85% of young people who go to disadvantaged schools make it to the leaving certificate and 15% do not.  It is in no way reflective of the person.  It is a brutal, savage system that puts far too much pressure on young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#O00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>We have lost the connection to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.

One key inhibitor of diversity in our second level education system is the high cost of becoming a teacher, and the length of time it takes.  While there are other methods, the normal process now is to do a BA or BSc, which takes four years, and it takes a further two years to obtain a professional master of education, PME, qualification.  All that, of course, costs an extraordinary amount of money.  It requires the length of time it takes to complete a normal four year degree in addition to half that length in order to become a teacher.  There is no doubt this is a huge barrier to diverse people becoming teachers in the education system.  On the other side of that, in regard to the system and those who work in schools, a recent OECD report showed the fantastic work they do in spite of the poor conditions they often work in.  One area it highlighted in the Irish education system was that it gives better opportunities to those who might be considered disadvantaged compared to the average in OECD countries.  As a representative of second level teachers, I am proud of that fact.<\/p> <p>  I refer to different modes of assessment.  I am a metal work teacher and my background is in engineering and the technical subjects, etc.<\/p><p>There are three modes.  There is a one-day practical examination in which the students get to prepare at their ease in the workshop.  They undertake a project over a prescribed period of three months, or ten to 15 weeks, I am not sure of the exact period off the top of my head, and then they have a written examination.  Most of the questions in that written examination are couched in a form that is situational.  They are not framed such that they are a test of a student's memory.  They are framed in the form of what would the student do if, etc.  If students are able to answer those, they must know what they are talking about.  I do not want to take up all the time as other people want to contribute.  I will leave it at responding to those two items.  The advice I would give students the night before an examination, as I have done on radio, is not to cram all information from their notes but to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.  Students need to have sharp wits to do well in examinations.  They do not need the ability to recall so much.  There is not so much of that required any more.  If students want to get good marks in their leaving certificate, they must understand what they are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Dennehy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time and I know Mr. Jones and Mr. Gillespie want to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#R00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>My apologies.

I am not trying to kiss up to the teachers but it is fair to say that they went above and beyond what was expected of them.  The effect all of this had on the student body has been extraordinary.  As was said by others, it highlighted that what we are doing currently is not what I would describe as fit for purpose but it could be improved.  Everybody here would accept that.<\/p><p>Having a final examination and taking account of all the issues mentioned by others, both here and in other fora, with respect to being ill, experiencing a bereavement and so on can set students back.<\/p><p> Like Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, I still have nightmares about my leaving certificate.  I am only slightly younger than the Deputy.  I am 43 years and I still recall the leaving certificate without fond memories.  There are elements we can learn from the assessments completed during Covid.  They were not perfect but they were the best we could do in the circumstances in which we found ourselves.  Points inflation was an unintended side effect of that approach.  That is not in any way, shape or form a negative comment in the context of what the profession was trying to do.  There are elements of this approach from which we can learn.  I would like to hear what the contributors have to offer in response. <\/p><p> I will focus on two issues.  The first one, a general comment that I raised at our previous meeting, relates to the psychological and mental health supports available to students.  These are of critical importance.  The committee produced a report making the same suggestion the INTO representative made, namely, that we need to provide access to the necessary services in schools, either on an individual or a group basis, to ensure that when students need supports they are available to them.  It is particularly appropriate to have those available in senior cycle.<\/p><p> The target of education is to educate.  It is not necessarily to enable students to proceed to a university degree.  There must be other pathways.  I took a circuitous route to my profession.  Higher and further education are essential.  That is why I was pleased to hear apprenticeships and other forms of further education mentioned.  No one will disagree that we need broader psychological and mental health supports.<\/p><p> In the context of access to other pathways to education, the Central Applications Office points race is important but it is not the be-all and end-all for students.  For many students, particularly those aged 17, 18 or 19 years, it is a seminal  moment in their lives that can leave a mark.  We do not necessarily want to leave a mark on a student's life in that sense.  We want to leave an enjoyment of education, reading and further and higher education and what they can achieve for themselves.  I ask any of the witnesses who wants to respond to do so within those parameters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#R02000","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>Mr. Gillespie is having connection difficulties.

In addition to the point that was made by the USI representative, there is a sense that students who achieve high points are wasting an opportunity if they do not go to university, even if they might be better served by taking a different route to higher education or taking a fresh approach.

It comes down to the attitude and mindset we have in respect of education.  We have to move towards a culture shift in terms of how we view education and different opportunities for students and people of all ages to engage in life-long learning.  It is particularly important that when guidance counselling sessions are offered to leaving certificate students, different options are presented to them.  Post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses, apprenticeships, taking a year out for personal development or entrance into the workforce should all be seen as valid and equal options, rather than just an add-on or a default if the student does not get into the course he or she wants.  It has to start with attitude change and a culture shift that it is to be hoped we can perpetrate.  Many students do not wish to go immediately or at all into college after the leaving certificate but there is often a societal pressure placed on them by family members and peers to enter college.  It is about trying to make education accessible at all stages of life.  If a person wishes to go into the workforce for ten years and then go to third level education, or take a year out and then do an apprenticeship, that should be recognised as being valid and okay.  It is about recognising that everyone has different strengths, interests and ambitions in life.  It comes down to the options presented to people during guidance counselling sessions at leaving certificate level but also that we as a society see them all as equal, recognise they all have a place in our society and that one is not better than another.

That said, as the points system is the only mechanism for measuring the achievements of students, it is clear why some students who achieve lower points, miss out on a university place by a small margin or choose to progress to other forms of further education feel like they have failed their second-level education.  As Ms Austick stated, we must normalise and remove the stigma in respect of PLC courses, apprenticeship programmes and other forms of further and higher education.

I am sure that when it was removed, the system went into a shock similar to the one that may ensue if we ever remove the leaving certificate.  However, it happened and the sky did not fall down.  We continued to educate children at primary school age to into second-level schools, which then became free to access thanks to the great Donogh O'Malley.  We need to consider other options.  The leaving certificate serves a purpose but it should not serve the whole purpose.  We need to be more creative and to engage in blue-sky thinking on this issue.  We made our submission based on the needs of children in special schools who have profound special needs and for whom alternatives must be found, but there are other children and students outside that sector for whom alternatives must also be found.

It may be the case that if first-year university examinations were more generic, such that students would get another half term or even a year to study generally before specialising in second year, it would make third level more accessible.

It has become clear not just in the past two years, but through several years, that the leaving certificate is in need of radical transformation.  I know the arguments that are made in respect of State certification.  That is an issue to which we can return.  However, it is true that too much rides on the terminal examination and that one day.  It has too many ramifications for students and their lives thereafter.  It can go wrong for a student who has done all the work.  Although there have been changes in many subjects in recent years - the leaving certificate I did is not the same as the one currently on offer - there are still too many subjects where it is all on the examination, or too much of it is.<\/p> <p>  In the context of transformation of the leaving certificate, it is important to state that this is not just about the structures and the examination.  We need to transform radically the culture of and the way we talk about the leaving certificate.  I appeal to the media not to make such an event of the leaving certificate and the results each year.  Many schools do not send enough students to third level because of disadvantage and structural obstacles, but there are other schools that probably send too many students to third level.  Such schools may have many students whose skills would be better suited to apprenticeships of various kinds.  Any discussion of the leaving certificate needs to take account of the need to transform radically how we deal with apprenticeships and other forms of vocational education.<\/p> <p>  In the context of how we talk about this, it is important that we approach it with an open mind.  We need to discuss all the options.  There are options that, in my view, could make things worse.  I would be very hesitant with regard to personal statements or things that could give additional advantages to students from a privileged background but while we are in this process we need to be open-minded and discuss all the options.<\/p> <p>  I have several questions.  As the most important voice is that of students, I will start with Ms Neville of the ISSU.  The observations on Irish are well made and I certainly have a lot of sympathy in that regard.  In other jurisdictions, one can accumulate the points, credits or whatever one needs to complete one's final examination over more than one year.  In the North, for example, in one's final year, one is building on the previous year.  Does Ms Austick believe we should be considering a system in which students' results build up gradually year on year?<\/p><p>The point made by the INTO about qualifications for students in special schools in the senior cycle cannot be lost as we progress through this process.  It is not something I have considered in detail, to tell the truth, but it is very important it remains part of our discussions.<\/p><p> I am glad to see Mr. Gillespie from the TUI has rejoined the meeting.  The TUI has made a very clear statement and I agree with its views on the leaving certificate applied, LCA, and the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the need to make them more dynamic.  I also agree there is a need to retain foundation level in Irish.  The TUI is hesitant about continuous assessment.  Some of that hesitancy is related to overassessment but some of it relates to concerns about teachers marking their own students.  There are parts of our education system involving non-State exams that are marked externally, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, scores at primary level.  I am not asking the witnesses to commit to anything because this is a discussion and consultation but would the TUI be open minded regarding the potential for continuous assessments that are marked externally and in accordance with high standards?  That would protect the important position of teachers in the Irish education system as advocates for students, as well as their position as teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#U00500","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Neville to respond, followed by Mr. Gillespie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#V00200","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":385,"content":"<p>The ISSU recommends that we take note of examples from other education systems, including the UK's A level system which uses the accumulation of credits and the USA's grade point average, GPA system, to devise a form of continuous assessment over the course of fifth and sixth year to alleviate unnecessary stress and pressure on students due to the great number of leaving certificate students relying solely on a final year examination.  In addition, we believe there is a strong demand from students for an opportunity to assess their knowledge and skills through second component assessments such as projects, presentations, oral exams and practical work.  Notably, this option received 63.9% support when it was put to students in our leaving certificate reform consultation.  Second component assessments as well as continuous assessments throughout fifth and sixth year could form the basis of student's final grades in the leaving certificate and would remove the undue pressure and stress on students and allow them to focus on learning and getting an holistic education rather than focusing on deadlines and three weeks of examinations at the end of sixth year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emer Neville"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Education is our greatest equalising and unifying endeavour.  It is fantastic in what it can achieve.  Education for education's sake should always be our primary goal.  The CAO system is nothing more than a supply and demand system that is often based on demographics and it should not govern the leaving certificate.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire referred to continuous assessment, but last year, when it was announced we were going to be using accredited grades, we had students coming to us and arguing every week over a couple of percentage points in homework assignments because they thought it was going to count towards their leaving certificate.  That is just continuous pressure and is not solving the problem.<\/p> <p>  What has just been said is more akin to what the TUI wants.  We want second components of assessment across the subjects, possibly even moved into fifth year, where we are teaching people what to learn and are focusing on the subject.  At the moment, 22 subjects have second components of assessment and 12 have more than one second component of assessment.  Some of these subjects can give students anything from 30% to 60% of the overall marks so that the nightmares that Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was having from 1994 are not an issue anymore because students are continuously doing something and are learning their subject.<\/p> <p>  When I was a physics and maths teacher I was arguing with myself about teaching students for the leaving certificate while also trying to prepare them for the next phase of life, whether that involved becoming an apprentice electrician or going to college.<\/p><p>I had to teach the subject because if I did not do so, they would not be prepared for the next phase of life.

Such assessments can be done externally.  <\/p><p> We cannot have a revolution here; because the leaving certificate is so important, it will have to be evolution rather than revolution.  It will require, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, a lot of consultation and movement.

I try to be as unbiased and neutral on this issue as I can but I would rather hear answers from the witnesses than tell them my opinions.  I know my own opinions and while I may deviate from them at times, and no doubt the more I hear from others, the more likely that is to happen, at the same time I would like to hear the experiences of the people on the call.<\/p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair hit the nail on the head when she said that no system is perfect and that this is going to evolve over time.  While the current leaving certificate programme is not ideal and is far from perfect, it has served us reasonably well over the years but undoubtedly, it is time for change.  That sentiment was echoed by most of the contributors to today's meeting and last week's meeting and I expect it will be echoed at future meetings.  We are speaking with one voice insofar as we believe that the day of the end of term exam, with 100% of everything dependent on that, is at an end.  There is a greater role for continuous assessment, presentations, oral exams and so forth.  <\/p> <p>  I would like a response to my first question from a student representative and a teacher or educator if possible.  Do the contributors believe that the external validation model is the way forward in terms of continually assessing in schools?  I would like a response from Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair and one of the student representatives in relation to Irish.  I was an Irish teacher and to be honest, when it came to the leaving certificate, if I was correcting at ordinary level I nearly looked forward to paper two because half of it was blank, such was the level of unanswered questions from students on the poetry and prose.  There were obviously difficulties there.  When I say \"looked forward\", I mean it in the context of getting the corrections over and done with but obviously, we want to see our students doing well.  In that regard, I could see that the Irish course, as currently structured, is not fit for purpose.  In my opinion, we should have a basic, predominantly oral-based course possibly supplemented by an advanced, Gaeilge fheidhmeach type course for students at a higher level or students from Gaelscoileanna.  Students could do an extra course or perhaps it could be structured so they get bonus points.  We need to get down to the nitty-gritty in terms of the Irish course and completely overhaul it.  I look forward to hearing the witnesses' opinions on the issues of external validation and Irish.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#W00300","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I support the comments made by Ms Neville in her opening remarks on behalf of ISSU about making the core curriculum of the Irish language more conversational, rather than preparing students for the final exam.

It shows the interest there is in promoting language as a concept, not just Gaeilge or European languages.  There is a major debate to be had, but all students have to be catered for and we must make sure, number one, if we are making certain that Gaeilge is a requirement for primary teaching, for example, that all students have access to an honours-level course that would enable them to access that.  The different abilities and competencies should be acknowledged, as they are in other subjects.  It needs to be acknowledged in Gaeilge freisin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I will give Mr. Gillespie one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#X00300","speaker":"1619"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>On the first question on external validation, the SEC has a tremendous reputation and can change, as we saw over the past two years, quickly.

People are much more mobile between courses, and between work and courses, throughout their careers and so on.  Nonetheless, a thought occurs to me.  What is the role and value of various kinds of aptitude testing throughout the secondary schooling period?  Does it go on much?  Is there value in it?  Is it seen as predictive?  We need hardly worry there will be a danger of funnelling students too narrowly and too soon because there is a broad and increasing breadth to the curriculum.  Is work being done in the area of techniques that will assist students to think about where their aptitudes lie?

To my knowledge, they are not used nearly as much now.<\/p><p>I had a dedicated career guidance teacher when I went to school all of those years ago who provided us with several interesting aptitude tests.  I think some colleges may have been interested in the results.  These tests used to be done - I think they still are - in first year to identify the various abilities of a new cohort.  This debate brings me to a key point that we are trying to get at here, namely, the systemic inadequacies of the second level education system caused by a lack of funding.  It is all right to say we should do this or that but we do not have the human and material resources to do it.  We have to be careful.  What we are doing with what we have is pretty impressive considering that it is only a tiny part of our GDP compared with what other countries spend.<\/p><p> We talk about other systems.  Senator Mullen may have read the Hyland report, which refers to these very criticisms of the system, that it is not fit for purpose and not serving people properly, that we should do this or that, etc.  All of these criticisms are probably true to an extent but they are levelled at other systems as well, particularly the US and UK systems.  Professor Hyland mentioned them in her report.  She also mentioned all kinds of alternatives, for example, introducing some other mechanism or examination to operate alongside the leaving certificate.  That exam or component would suffer from the same sort of what one might call \"gaming of the system\" where people will be coached to do it.  Who will be coached?  It will be those who have the most resources.  I work in the education system and it is difficult to work in it because classes are too big and teachers feel they are not doing enough and there are many students for whom they would much prefer to do more  The education system is flawed but it is also lacking investment.  The people who work in it are doing their best.<\/p><p> With regard to change, the system is not able to change under the current system of funding.  For example, with regard to guidance, counselling and psychological services, as we state in the paper we submitted to the committee, these services are aspirational.  They are something we would like to provide.  We would like to be fair and equal but the investment to do that is not being provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#Y00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Dennehy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I will respond to the point made about investment in education at both second and third level.  One of the main reasons there is so much stress and pressure placed on leaving certificate students is the build-up to the examinations.  The communication around it is that students should get the leaving certificate, choose a course, go to third level and then that is it.  There is no real opportunity to deviate, for example, take time out before going to college.  One of the main reasons for that is the cost associated with attending third level education.  Students automatically assume they must pick the right course at the age of 17 or 18.  People can change, develop and change their mindset and attitude over 20 years.  It is completely unfair that this monumental milestone opportunity occurs when people are aged 17 or 18 and there is no other opportunity for them to go back to third level.  There are options, access courses and alternative routes but it is more challenging to get into them.  When we talk about access to education, we must start with the funding that is allocated to second and third level to ensure there is no financial barrier placed in the way of students.<\/p><p>If a 17-year-old student decides to do a course and after a year decides it would be more beneficial to take three years out to go into the workforce before returning to higher education at the age of 30 or later, that is okay.

It would be interesting to research how many people failed first year because they had the incorrect leaving certificate subjects for the subjects they picked up in college.

I thank all the organisations that are with us today, the ISSU and the USI on behalf of students, and the IFUT, INTO and ASTI on behalf of teachers and educators for giving us their time this morning.  Students' experiences and future endeavours, their careers and vocations, are at the heart of our discussions regarding the reform of the senior cycle.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, have both contributed and both are very committed to reform in this area.<\/p> <p>  Our educational system adapted in the last 18 months due to urgent need.  That is thanks to the educators who are here today who had to develop a system, which came down to the accredited grades and so on, to support students getting through the last year or two.  We owe a debt of gratitude for the work that has been completed to date.  I met locally with some of our teacher representative groups, including the INTO, which explained very clearly its perspective on the last 18 months.  We have a high level of qualification among our teachers at post-primary level.  We would like things to be a little bit different.  So many of our second level students - over 84,000 - apply through the CAO form.  It is a huge number.  That is the way things are.  We may wish them to be different but that is currently the way things are.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has done a lot in terms of looking at reforming the CAO form, along with Solas and the Irish Universities Association, IUA, to allow it to include apprenticeships and further and higher education places, in order to make sure that students are fully aware of all the options that are out there.  The cost of going to third level has been mentioned as well and there are options for earning and learning but families and students need to be made aware of that.  Sometimes it comes down to communication and having those extra options on the CAO forms will encourage students to see what other options are out there. <\/p> <p>  Some of my questions relate to the statements we received, which cover wide areas including subject choices, digital learning, assessments, well-being, access and equality.  My first question, for Ms Austick from the USI, is on the high rates of drop-outs in first year for students at third level.  Does Ms Austick have some detail on that?  In STEM courses we sometimes see a high level of drop-outs and I have seen some figures suggesting up to 7,000 drop-outs a year at third level.  How can we support students at that point?  What can we do in that regard, taking the leaving certificate into account?  I would pose the same question to Ms Neville.  So many students are going down the track of the CAO at second level.  I am sure Ms Neville sees this in the organisation she represents.  In what ways can we engage with career guidance in terms of this potential reform of the leaving certificate?<\/p> <p>  My next questions are for Mr. Gillespie, Ms N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair and the representative from the IFUT.<\/p><p>Mr. Jones might speak from a further and higher education perspective, including our PLCs and Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.  Some of the organisations might have representatives from further and higher education as well, including perhaps Mr. Gillespie from the TUI.

That is far too high.  The possibility of having more preliminary subjects in first year and a reduction in the number of subjects were mentioned.  This stems from the theme of this meeting, which has been trying to distinguish between the leaving certificate and the points race.  There is a view that if a student get points for a subject, which are set by demand and supply, that student is wasting an opportunity is he or she does not enter that field, which may not be the area for him or her at all.

The unfortunate reality is that many people decide to drop out and do not avail of the supports they need early on in first year or throughout college.

Many students in college are doing their second, third or fourth choice because they did not get their first one as a result of CAO points.  It comes down to how the points system is interlinked with it all but we can support them by emphasising the different pathways available to students.  Some students will benefit from taking a year out or doing a PLC or some other work before going to college.  Then, if someone is struggling during their course, we can ensure they avail of the supports available to them through investment in the support services that are there and awareness of supporting students' progression.

One of the big things is the support students get before they fill in the CAO form in schools.  Over the past ten years, we have had serious cutbacks in the career guidance structure.  We have only one guidance counsellor in a school of 700.  We have schools below a certain level that do not have guidance counsellors.  The idea where we had pastoral care pre-2009 and teachers who were year heads has all been cut back over the past ten years.  The individual care we have been capable of giving to every student has been radically reduced.  It is not that students may not be able for the course; they just might not have an interest in it.  They pick the wrong route and that is because people have not focused on and supported them.  People fall through the cracks.<\/p> <p>  Giving us more places in college is only one aspect.  They will be eaten up by the demographic increase over the next couple of years of people going to leaving certificate. It is about preparedness and focusing minds on doing the right thing.  There is nothing wrong, as was said earlier, with going off to do an apprenticeship and then doing a degree years later.  One might be a better engineer for that.  We have to open people's minds to the different routes available and that can only be done by supporting them in school with enough proper guidance counsellors and pastoral care systems that spot students who are a little lost and putting down the wrong choices because external reasons have told them to put them down and not to waste X number of points, as Mr. Jones said.

I listened intently last week and this to the submissions.  As I see it, this is probably the biggest change management project we have undergone for decades.  I note the differences in approach, particularly where Mr. Gillespie said we need evolution rather than revolution, while Ms Neville said we need radical change.  I come down on Ms Neville's side because I think we need radical change.  We have a decision to make.  We either tweak around the edges and try to keep everybody happy or we do something fundamentally different.  I acknowledge the wonderful work that is being done in schools with limited resources but there is an opportunity for change that we have never had.  Change management and change are always uncomfortable and need to be because we only make progress out of our comfort zones.  There will be discomfort.<\/p> <p>  In what we produce from the committee and the evidence we will hear, it is vital that we have resources attached to that and a commitment from Government that those resources will be delivered.<\/p><p> Looking at the leaving certificate, there is agreement across the board that we need continuous assessment.  Currently we are cramming everything into two weeks while expecting young people to vomit up all they have learned on a page so we can tell them they are either good or bad and this dictates what they will do in their additional education pathways.  That is totally wrong and out of sync with everything all of us believe in.  It just cannot go on and we must stop such a process now.  How we stop it and what we need to do that are the two questions.<\/p><p> I have heard what has been said about continuous assessment and the need for the external assessment.  I suppose that concerns what I want to ask.  Will Mr. Gillespie indicate how the external assessment would work in that respect?  I very much like the idea of the different assessments being spread over two years.  We need reform.  We must all be honest about what might be my greatest fear.  The students who can afford to get outside lessons, tutoring and support, whether it is in a particular subject or in paying &euro;250 for career guidance, will be okay.  There are, however, very bright students who cannot afford that and we are doing them an enormous disservice, which cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p><p> When we studied the third level sector last year, we heard that 75% of students said they did not get enough career guidance in second level.  I appreciate the honesty from the witnesses around that aspect.  For something that is so vital, there may be one career guidance person for 700 students.  That is a waste of time and the school might as well not have any.  It does not matter whether it is a wonder woman or a wonder man.  It is a case of ticking the boxes and we are doing too much of that.  Until we have the proper resources, we will continue ticking those boxes.<\/p><p> I have gone on a bit but what the witnesses are doing and hearing their voices is really important.  Will Mr. Gillespie speak to me about how the external continuous assessment will work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#EE00700","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>We can go back to the core idea that we had, which is to develop second components of assessments in subjects that can start being assessed in fifth year in certain aspects.  They would have to be appropriate to the level of knowledge, skills or competences for that stage.  It would be a case of State certification of those, and all those second components of assessment would be added together.  As I said, there are already subjects where 60% of the exam is done due to second components of assessments before the formal exam is done in May or June.  For example, this year home economics will be the first leaving certificate exam when it begins in December.  The first component of assessment of home economics will be in December and it will gradually build and add together.<\/p> <p>  These processes also measure different skills.  If we design second components of assessment and it is not a case of measuring ability on a written exam, we will give better opportunities to all the types of intelligence and learning abilities in students.  It widens the spread of what can be examined and what students can benefit from.  We would give more opportunity to students.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy indicates, the problem is we are resource-poor in schools.  We are punching way above our weight in all the OECD measurements for the level of investment we have compared with other countries.  It is something we should be proud of but why not make up that level of investment so we could have the required number of guidance teachers or therapeutic supports that were mentioned earlier for the students who need it?  All these support systems are absolutely overstretched in our schools, which limits our performance and our ability to help students to achieve what they should be capable of.<\/p> <p>  We have already mentioned the number of people who are failing in first year for a variety of reasons.  It could be down to economic support, for example.  An earlier question asked why there is not diversity in teachers.  We have geographic and social issues in training teachers.<\/p><p>In certain areas of the world, teachers cannot get a placement for their postgraduate diploma in education because there is no availability of a college in their area.  There would be an added cost in doing it elsewhere.  Everything eventually comes down to finance and the lack of financial support for students and the systems that need to support those students.  It all comes down to money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#FF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gillespie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Yes, and it must be targeted to the right place and prioritised.  We cannot allow what is happening with career guidance to continue.  People are not fulfilling their potential because they do not have the right career guidance.  We can have all the apprenticeship programmes we want, along with all the other alternatives, but it will not matter if there is appropriate career guidance personnel to talk through choices with individual students about where their strengths lie.<\/p> <p>  The INTO submission refers to special classes in mainstream education and students with particular needs.  We talk about selecting students at second level and all of that.  Students are being selected at five years old when it comes to the question of special classes.  We have two excellent special classes in County Mayo, with seven pupils in each class.  There is one in Ballina and one in Castlebar.  There is a major demand for those.  That may arise because children have not got the supports in audiology or speech and language therapies through no fault of their own.  The competition is nominally for seven places but it can amount to perhaps six places between the two because the full cohort of students is not replaced each time.  It is totally wrong.  We are excluding children at five years old from our education system.<\/p> <p>  That is why reform is needed throughout the system and not just at leaving certificate level.  I was glad to see that mentioned in the INTO submission as a challenge.  It is purely a question of resources.  In speaking to people at these schools, I know they and other schools would be happy to have these special classes with speech and language elements but they do not have the resources.  They are being refused those resources, which is wrong.  I know the wonderful outcomes that can come from those classes.  They can be life-changing and there is no other way to describe them.  I commend those schools that do such a good job in that sense.<\/p> <p>  It is invaluable to hear from the student representatives and I thank them for giving their time today.

One of the suggestions put forward by Ms Neville in her presentation on behalf of secondary school students was that the terminal exam of the leaving certificate be spaced out over a longer period.  I suppose the reason for the recommendation is that the exam period can be stressful if a student must do two exams per day or an exam on consecutive days.  What is the view of the ASTI and the TUI on such a recommendation coming from this committee?  It might space out the terminal exams over two months, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#GG00600","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>There is no real issue around that.  What we want to preserve in our schools, and what I want as a practising teacher, is for the teacher to be an advocate for the students being taught.  I do not want to be judge, jury or executioner if it comes to that either.<\/p><p>I do not want to do that, especially at that age of students' lives.  We are talking about teenagers who may be 16, 17 or 18 years of age.  They do not need somebody to judge everything they do, all of the time.  They need an advocate and support and that is what teachers do now, under our present assessment.  Our system is also verifiably fair.  It is absolutely fair and transparent.  It does not allow one school or person have an advantage over another in the exam.  All the things happen around and before the exam, such as coaching and all that, but that is what happens when one has an unequal society.   The schools are not unequal - society is.  People who come from the poorer parts will not be able to access the education system in the same way as wealthy people, especially when it is one as poorly funded as ours.<\/p><p> The system we have now is fighting with one hand behind its back, on behalf of our young people.  The real proof of that is we manage.  Our schools are safe, fair and democratic places in which people can even overcome their socioeconomic disadvantage.  That was proven in the recent OECD report.  That is about the culture of schools we have.  I suggest having funding.  By all means, let us evolve our system.  Let us look at areas of it and improve them and maybe have two components in every subject.  I do not know.  We will look into that, but it must be based on solid research and it has to be financed.

Recently, we met a group of teachers and principals who had been involved in the pilot therapies in schools programme.  Under that scheme, schools were given access to speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, who worked with clusters of schools.  There was also meant to be access to nursing services, but that did not transpire.  While the pilot's roll-out was affected by Covid, the principals and teachers involved were complimentary of the short period of time in which they engaged with the therapists.  Schools and teachers can give a great deal of support to pupils, but we have pupils who are extremely needy and who need other therapeutic interventions.  This is not new.  More than 30 years ago, I was involved in a pilot project where teacher counsellors were allocated a certain number of schools, but because of the definition of \"counselling\" in this country and what counselling is held to be, it became the support service and never came out of its pilot.<\/p> <p>  The level of need in schools is great.  One of the main issues is that we do not have access to therapists.  It is difficult, even for the HSE, to recruit therapists of any kind.  Unfortunately, the therapists who were involved in the pilot programme have been withdrawn back into the HSE and the schools have told us that they have not had communication regarding the scheme since last April.  Maybe that has changed in the past week and I am unaware of it, but the situation is at crisis level in our schools.  We all recognise the value of intervention at the earliest stage to help children cope with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021100500002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Ms M&aacute;ir&iacute;n N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank N&iacute; Ch&eacute;ileachair.

It will be remembered as a time when things could have gone one of two ways.  The force is at the lowest point in its history, with an official strength figure of only 1,513 effective personnel or 37% of what the force should have, an annual net loss in members since 2015, significant underutilisation, and only a trickle of resources being sent its way to support reserve activities, an issue that is most keenly felt in terms of recruitment.  At the same time, there are developments in train that suggest a possible brighter future for the force.  The passage of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 granted reservists employment protection in the event of an emergency call-up, meaning should reservists be temporarily activated for full-time service, their jobs would be legally protected while they were away in uniform.  The Reserve Defence Force also forms one of the key terms of reference of the Commission on the Defence Forces, while the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020, which aims to provide reservists with a legal underpinning to engage in domestic and overseas operational service, was recently passed by the D&aacute;il before progressing to the Seanad.<\/p> <p>  In the coming months, therefore, one of two things will happen.  The Reserve Defence Force will either wither away to nothing and finally cease to exist or it will be given a meaningful, modern purpose and become a fully integrated, utilised and utilisable element of the Defence Forces, thereby becoming a rejuvenated, vibrant force again.<\/p><p>Members of the Reserve stood shoulder to shoulder with members of the Permanent Defence Force during the 1940s Emergency period and later along the Border during the Troubles.  For decades the force provided the Defence Forces with a local footprint throughout the State, acted as a feeder for the Permanent Defence Force, and stood ready to boost Permanent Defence Force numbers in times of need.<br\/><br\/>Ultimately, the future of the Reserve will be decided by key civil and military stakeholders.  This includes the members of the committee.  Why is it a good idea to utilise the Reserve in such a central way and how could this be achieved?  The State's national and international defence commitments will only increase in the years ahead.  This will be associated with the changing jurisdictional, legal, political and security landscape arising from Brexit, along with our evolving collective responsibilities in the EU and the commitment Ireland retains to supporting international security and humanitarian missions.  Such duties and priorities reflect not only the State's values and ethics but also our responsibilities towards financial, economic and social protection, investment and growth.<br\/><br\/>The actions of adversaries towards the State and its interests require that the military attends to the ongoing development and modernisation of new military capabilities and strategies, which means addressing myriad factors across air, land, sea, cyber and space.  Many of the defence and security challenges and priorities for Ireland will necessitate a shift in military culture in the State and throughout State bodies.  While priority should remain on urgently addressing and enhancing the deficits within the Permanent Defence Force, there is significant scope to maximise the utilisation of the Reserve.  The Permanent Defence Force's establishment is 9,500 personnel but, as of June 2021, the force's strength is only 8,570, with 500 of these being new personnel in training.  This has resulted in skills shortages in several key areas.  As of February 2021, 50% of officer appointments in the medical and marine engineering branches are vacant while 33% of engineering, 44% of communications and information services and 28% of ordnance officer appointments are also unfilled.  The problem is not limited to officer-specific appointments.  It was recently reported that the Naval Service is experiencing a 33% deficiency in chefs along with other shortages in non-officer roles such as engine room artificers and medics.  Similarly, the Army nursing service currently stands at only 3% to 4% of establishment.<br\/><br\/>Due to the current low strength figure, the Permanent Defence Force is now experiencing difficulties in filling overseas missions without resorting to the mandatory detailing of personnel.  I stress that reservists do not want to take one cent or one career-progressing opportunity away from any member of the Permanent Defence Force but if our regular counterparts need supporting we should be capable of providing that support.  There is also a low carrying cost for the contingent capability provided by reservists.  We are not in receipt of weekly salaries and are only paid when we engage in relevant military activities.  As a result, a concerted effort should begin to grow and develop the Reserve, with associated improvements to the supports provided for reservists.  This process should focus not only on addressing critical shortages in key specialist areas in the Defence Force as a whole but also on returning the Reserve to a strength level where it can meaningfully surge in support of the Permanent Defence Force in response to any contingent event.<br\/><br\/>Put simply, if the State is to prepare for future defence commitments then investment in the Reserve, along with increased training and utilisation, is the best way to achieve this in a cost-effective manner.  How could this greater utilisation be achieved?  The legislative developments currently in train and the ongoing work of the commission on the Defence Forces are a promising start.  However, the devil will be in the implementation detail.  Not one of the Reserve Defence Force projects arising from the 2015 White Paper on Defence has been initiated to date so there are understandable fears within the Reserve community that any Reserve-specific recommendations arising from the work of the Commission on the Defence Forces, even those accepted for implementation, will never be acted upon or will be scheduled for initiation long after the Reserve has dropped below a strength level where it simply cannot claw its way back from the brink.  Therefore, the first answer to the question on how greater Reserve utilisation could be achieved is to conduct rigorous oversight of the accepted recommendations arising from the work of the commission on the Defence Forces to ensure they are actually implemented, and implemented promptly.<br\/><br\/>The Reserve needs to be given meaningful purpose across the full range of operational activities, thereby placing it centre stage alongside the Permanent Defence Force.  This will necessitate investment and enhanced training and service opportunities for reservists to get the force to a point where it can deliver on such a role.  The Reserve also knows that this means increased expectations and outputs will be placed on members.  If the State provides greater financial inputs, we know we have to provide more service outputs in return.  This will not be an issue for reservists as the culture of the Reserve has always been one of service, stepping up when needed and giving something back.<br\/><br\/>To secure the availability of future reservists as and when needed additional legislative changes will be required.  Reservists are currently considered as volunteers, a status which means that we cannot be compelled, except during an emergency call up, to report into barracks for anything.  Therefore, every time members of the Reserve report for training or any other military activity they are technically doing so of their own free will, and each time it all comes down to the personal availability of each individual reservist on that particular day, which will almost always be dictated by whether or not they can get the time off work.  Therefore, to provide Permanent Defence Force commanders with the assurances they need that Reserve members will be able to report in without issue if called upon, the Reserve needs to be redefined from volunteers to part-time workers, and a form, or forms, of employment protection legislation needs to be enacted to secure reservists' employment in their absence should they be called up for temporary military service.  Coupled with employment protection legislation, there will also be a need to introduce corresponding employer supports designed to help offset the burden placed on employers during their reservist employee's temporary absence.  Such schemes have existed for many years in other states and there are multiple successful examples to study and learn from.  Such significant changes could not be successfully implemented without the proper emphasis being placed on the management of cultural change within the wider Defence Forces.  This is a key area for change managers to address if the Reserve is to be meaningfully utilised in future.<br\/><br\/>The future Reserve needs to expand, not contract, its footprint across all counties and then be resourced properly to recruit up to full strength.  A geographically dispersed Reserve would allow the Defence Forces to maintain a footprint nationwide, which aside from allowing the Defence Forces to have active personnel available throughout the country would make them more visible in general, thereby allowing the Reserve to return to being a meaningful feeder for Permanent Defence Force recruitment.  Ultimately, given our current precarious status, reservists nationwide are pinning all their hopes on what will follow the publication of the commission on the Defence Forces' final report.  Our current status has also made the Reserve a fertile ground for change.  Members are willing to adopt the positive changes that will, hopefully, come our way and are enthusiastic about engaging in the change management process.<br\/><br\/>The view is that anything would be better than maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>.  However, tangentially, it is worth noting that in recent months many of the key Reserve issues that need addressing now, and not at some undefined point in future following the conclusion of the commission's work, have been consistently deferred to after the commission&rsquo;s final report has been published.  The commission's ongoing work has become too tempting an excuse to stall fixing a Reserve issue now, by essentially saying we do not know what the commission will come back with so we have decided not to take any action at this time.<br\/><br\/>In the area of recruitment, current inaction is threatening the Reserve's existence to survive until the commission publishes its final report.  While it is accepted that the few applicants still live from the 2019 and 2020 recruitment competitions will now finally be called for induction testing in the coming weeks, this represents only a tiny percentage of what could be achieved if a new properly resourced recruitment competition seeking new applicants was launched nationwide.<br\/><br\/>While we have outlined the four key enablers for the future Reserve, to stay alive long enough to benefit from the commission's report the current Reserve needs new recruits.  There are many other benefits to creating an operational future Reserve.  In March 2020, it was reported that 6.9% of the Permanent Defence Force were female, with females comprising 4.2% of overseas missions.  As of January 2021, the effective strength of the Reserve is 13.3% female, almost double that of the Permanent Defence Force.  The current Army Reserve potential officers course, which is in the process of training the next generation of Army Reserve managers, is 24% female.  The part-time nature of Reserve service tends to make it more attractive to females because, by definition, the Reserve has inherently flexible working practices.  Given that retention of working mothers is linked to family-friendly organisational cultures, and that, as of March 2020, it was reported that 50% of serving Permanent Defence Force female personnel are mothers, the creation of temporary part-time Permanent Defence Force appointments specifically in support of the Reserve may be beneficial for Permanent Defence Force female personnel by allowing them to avail of a short working week for the duration of their time in such an appointment.  Furthermore, Permanent Defence Force personnel seeking a career break could be permitted to take up appointments temporarily on the strength of the Reserve, in essence becoming reservists themselves, for the duration of their career break before returning to the Permanent Defence Force afterwards with no break in military service.  Overall, such measures may promote retention of personnel within the Permanent Defence Force.<br\/><br\/>Anecdotally, a significant proportion of Reserve members have heritage links to other countries, often places where the military has greater visibility or where military service, either of a voluntary or compulsory nature, is more widespread among the population than in Ireland.<\/p><p>Often such members have strong traditions of military service in their families and while preferring to work or study full-time in a civilian capacity, they see service in the Reserve as a part-time way of engaging with this aspect of their heritage.  This means the Reserve tends to be more culturally diverse than the Permanent Defence Forces.<\/p><p> The Reserve's annual budgetary allocation, which has remained unchanged since 2014, is &euro;2.15 million per annum, or 0.26% of the &euro;810 million allocated to Vote 36 for the 2021 defence budget.  That is not 2.6% but 0.26%.  All of this has come to pass while the Vote 36 budgetary allocation has increased by approximately 18% during the same seven-year period.  We are stating these figures to show what the Reserve has managed to survive on.  It is subsisting but it has nonetheless survived for the past decade.  Even still, it has managed to deliver a level of professional training to members as well as supporting the Permanent Defence Forces inside and outside of barracks, albeit in an unfortunately limited fashion, both before and during the Covid-19 pandemic and in support of the HSE during the recent cyberattack.  We did all this on the budgetary equivalent of peanuts.<\/p><p> A modest investment in the Reserve, along with the operational utilisation of members, the introduction of a form or forms of employment protection and employer supports, a geographical expansion of the force and the proper resourcing of recruitment, along with rigorous oversight of the whole process will create a well-trained, utilisable and cost effective force that can support the Permanent Defence Forces as and when needed.  It can do so in the areas of both specialist skills and in a surge capacity in cases of contingent events.  This is a crossroads moment and a once in a generation opportunity for the Reserve to finally become an integral element of the Irish defence infrastructure.  We sincerely hope this will become a reality in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>That is a stark assessment of the state of the Reserve Defence Forces.

I have always felt that the members of the Reserve Defence Forces were motivated by a great patriotism and sense of volunteerism in that it was not just a career for them but a way for them to give to society on top of their normal jobs and lives.  That is an admirable quality and something that merits recognition.  It is the kind of resource and motivation we should not lose.<\/p> <p>  The Reserve used to have a strong link with its communities when I was a youngster but I know the closure of local barracks has damaged that.  I was wondering about one solution in a Cavan context but it may apply in other counties and I hope it does.  We have a strong Civil Defence voluntary association in Cavan.  I am sure that is the case in most counties but they are active in Cavan and they were involved a lot during Covid with meals on wheels, visiting older people and attending the few events that took place to make sure everything was all right.  Would integration with the Civil Defence assist the Reserve in its work?  Would Mr. Richardson see that as a plus or would he see potential there?<\/p> <p>  I agree that members of the Reserve should be treated as part-time workers and that its budget should increase.  It is an advantage that there is now a facility for members of the force to leave work when called.  It would be helpful for the committee to know what kind of funding the Reserve requires and would get in an ideal world?  It would be important for us to know that.  I favour the status of part-time workers for members of the Reserve but I see a risk in it.  Could it reduce the volunteerism and be inappropriate to some people or would it be desirable to balance the two?  How would Mr. Richardson see that working out?<\/p> <p>  Those are my questions but I want to welcome Mr. Richardson.  This is a neglected area and the members of the Reserve are great people.  I have known people in my community who have served down the years and it is a great act of service and patriotism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#C00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their opening statement, particularly Mr. Richardson who delivered it.  It is an area of work that the committee is only starting to focus.  I, therefore, welcome this engagement, which it is timely given all the difficulties facing the Reserve Defence Forces.  It is alarming to look at and listen to some of the language that is being used to describe where we are such as the reference to being at a crossroads with what will happen in the next couple of months.  The Reserve could wither away to nothing and cease to exist and if that was to happen it would be a sad day for our Defence Forces and the excellent service that has been delivered over many years.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask a number of specific questions.  A lot of focus is being put on the commission on the future of the Defence Forces and the work it is undertaking, which is a long time coming and which is welcome.  We are being told we will get a copy of that report by the end of the year or early next year.  What engagement has taken place with the commission other than the submission the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association has made to it?  I also want to ask about the recruitment campaigns, specifically the 2019 campaign when there were two distinct recruitment campaigns for both the Army Reserve and the Naval Reserve, respectively.  More than 2,600 applicants came forward at that stage.<\/p><p>Very few of them were progressed from the application stage and brought into the force.  I listened to the general secretary when he said that some of those members are still on the books and the hope is to bring them forward.  The concern, as stated previously, is around the delays in bringing those applicants forward and the two-year timeframe involved.  How many of those people have lost interest?  For how many of them has life moved on?  In real terms, can we explicitly say how many of those 2,600 who have not been taken into the force still have an interest?<\/p><p> I share some of the concerns, particularly those around the White Paper.  It is very alarming that none of the projects identified in the White Paper has been enacted.  That is a cause of concern.  I am hopeful for the commission and its work.  The proof will be in the delivery of it and there is a key role for this committee and others in ensuring the best report possible comes from the commission and that its recommendations are fully implemented.<\/p><p> I have a number of other questions.  In his opening statement, Mr. Richardson said, \"The future Reserve needs to expand, not contract, its footprint across all counties of the State and then be resourced properly to recruit up to full strength.\"  I remember proudly that the 21st Infantry Battalion had three locations in Wicklow, one in Arklow, another in Wicklow town and a third in Rockbrae House in Bray.  The battalion also had a location in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  With the restructuring of the organisation, the 21st Infantry Battalion was amalgamated with the 20th Infantry Battalion to create the 62nd Infantry Battalion.  The impact is that the Reserve Defence Force does not have a footprint in Wicklow.  It is not as visible as it was.  What do our guests think about that impact?  Reference was made to that issue in their opening statement.  <\/p><p> There are 1,513 members of the Reserve Defence Force.  Do our guests have a breakdown of those members?  I do not expect them to have a breakdown here but perhaps they could furnish the committee with a breakdown, county by county, as to where those numbers come from.  Not having a footprint on the ground in each of the counties is having a negative impact.<\/p><p> I welcome the advancement of the Defence (Amendment) Bill, which is working its way through the Seanad.  The Minister has committed to following that up, which is critical.  Mr. Richardson, in his opening statement, made reference to the necessity for employment protection legislation.  I agree that is critical and needs to follow on quickly from the passing of the Defence (Amendment) Bill.  In his opening statement, Mr. Richardson specifically mentioned that a number of countries have put protections and legislation in place, and there is best practice out there.  Perhaps he could point us towards a country in which legislation has been enacted and where it works.<\/p><p> My final question relates to funding.  The situation is stark and concerning.  The budget for the Reserve Defence Force has remained static since 2014 at &euro;2.15 million per annum.  That does not speak of a Government that takes pride, or sees value, in its Reserve, or sees the potential to expand its remit.  What engagement has taken place with the Department and the Minister?  Can our guests give us an ideal figure that they think should be acceptable in terms of the expansion of the Reserve?  What would be an ideal figure to operate with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#C00500","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I will now revert to our guests to deal with the questions raised by Deputy Clarke, Senator O'Reilly and Deputy Brady.

They are quite thematically similar.  I will answer the question of how important is the geographical expansion.  I will take a geographical area with which I am familiar, namely, the Longford-Roscommon area.  Prior to 2012, there was a Reserve training centre in Roscommon town and Connolly Barracks was in Longford.  That would have allowed reservists or people who were interested in joining the Reserve in those two counties to have a central point where they could come to be trained and to engage with the organisation.  They were subsequently closed.  County Longford, as Deputy Brady said was true of County Wicklow, no longer has a Reserve training centre at all.  We could go through other counties, including Laois and Offaly, where there simply is not a Reserve presence anymore.<\/p> <p>  How important is that contraction of the Reserve?  It disincentivises interested parties in those regions from joining the Reserve.  If people in the Longford-Roscommon area have an interest in joining the Reserve, their closest centre might be in Mullingar, Athlone town or Boyle in north County Roscommon.  That might be quite a distance to travel for a young individual who might find it hard to get there.  I am not even talking about younger individuals who might not have their own form of transport but serving reservists who are now being told there is an ancillary travel cost associated with attending for training.  That training is often voluntary or free.  A person is being told that instead of a journey of a couple of miles, perhaps walking distance to a training centre or local barracks, he or she now has to put a certain amount of fuel into the car, at their personal cost, to attend a training event for which they are not paid.  Service in the Reserve now comes at a net cost.  Quite a lot of reservists over recent years have simply weighed up whether it is economically feasible for them to remain serving and decided it is not.  That is where some of the loss of members has come from.<\/p> <p>  Providing a centre, at least one per county, gives local reservists or local interested applicants an opportunity to serve locally.  It facilitates that level of engagement.  If we shut down Reserve training centres, so they are few and far between throughout the State, we can look into that situation and see exactly why reservists stop turning up.  Attendance comes at a net cost to reservists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":485,"content":"<p>Deputy Clarke also asked about overseas service for reservists and our view as to how that might be accomplished or what its purpose might be.  I will start by stating that in the first instance, we had proposed overseas service.  The intention was not to displace any of our comrades in the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, from their service because we understand overseas service is part of the requirements of their service.  We have often noted commentary from members of the PDF who return from overseas service having served with reservists from other European nations.  They often remark on how seamlessly it works and the benefits of having somebody with an exposure to the military way of life and a complementary civilian outlook.<\/p> <p>  We would see that, initially at least, there are specialist roles which need to be filled.  That is a short-term solution to other, broader problems with the Defence Forces overall.  There are opportunities to utilise specialists in the cybersecurity and medical areas.  There are also, presumably, opportunities in logistics when there are shortcomings or challenges around providing the manpower from the Permanent Defence Forces.  Those opportunities also come with challenges.  For a reservist to serve overseas and make that commitment, not only is it costly in terms of their family commitments but there are also risks to their jobs.  It is not just a matter of holding an appointment open for somebody when he or she leaves his or her civilian job, but there are also the opportunities on which he or she might miss out.  <\/p> <p>  We can come to the shape of the legislation and how it ought to be thought of as we try to look after the interests of reserves.  We are only talking about a small number of people.<\/p><p>I suggest that, initially, there could be specialist roles.  There is, however, another aspect to this.  When we made the original proposal for overseas service for reservists, my thoughts on that were that if we could get every part of the mechanism for training reservists working to produce people to the standard required to serve overseas along with the PDF, whose members have a whole military career behind them, then that in itself would mean that all the processes, procedures and training would have had to have gone right for at least some of our number.  To be practical about that, someone going overseas, even for a short-term engagement, would have to have all their equipment, be trained, be to a medical standard and a fitness standard and have all the technical courses complete.  For all that to happen, however, the whole pyramid of support services has to be in place and work seamlessly, and that is important to consider.  That was the objective.  It was not necessarily so much about putting Reserve boots on the ground overseas.  It was about what that would represent.  It would represent the fact that the mechanism from recruitment all the way through for all their training would be working well.  That is our view on the role overseas.<\/p><p> I will move on to Senator O'Reilly.  I take his point about the Civil Defence in Cavan.  I am a Cavan man and know many former colleagues who have moved into the Civil Defence and they do an excellent job, but there is a difference between the Reserve Defence Force and the Civil Defence.  We are trained in military matters and in the use of lethal force.  We are bound by military law.  The Civil Defence does not have those sorts of constraints and its service is very different.  I would find it challenging to see how both could be integrated.  There are some complementary overlaps on which we could work together more closely, perhaps, such as exercises or something of that nature, but trying to join the two of them up would, I think, be a challenge.<\/p><p> In response to the question about part-time worker status and the legislation, again, there are challenges with legislation on employment protection.  I think that in the area of employment equality some work has already been done.  The protection of ordinary workers was a long time coming over the years.  I am minded that I am probably of an age that I can recall when a long time ago there was a significant debate on the protection of employment for women on maternity leave.  That was considered by some to be an insurmountable challenge and one which would be very costly to private industry and the State, yet it was rightly sorted out to whatever extent one might think, and maybe it could be enhanced, but these are challenges which can be fixed.<\/p><p> As for amendments to existing legislation, we would be cautious in making recommendations.  We do not want to suggest seismic changes to legislation because these matters should be approached cautiously.  I would favour making small changes, at least initially, rather than something too big.<\/p><p> It should be borne in mind there has to be proper engagement with other stakeholders as well.  It is not just us but it is also the Department of Defence, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and employers' representatives.  There a lot of voices to be heard as to how this will work.  Of course, we would like to be at the centre of that to guide how it would go through.<\/p><p> Mr. Richardson made a point in his opening address about our status.  The fact that we are classed as volunteers has long been a concern for us.  There are two types of volunteers.  There is the type in the popular imagination, that is, people who do things for nothing.  My concern about that is that if you do something for nothing, it is seen as being worthless, and we are not worthless.  We actually provide an enormous pool of resources to the State freely and of our own time.  Some of what we do is paid for, but we need to recognise that.  In doing so, I think we will go part of the way to addressing issues with recruitment and retention.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly asked about funding.  The exercise of developing a budget appropriate to what it is the Reserve does would have to encompass the outputs the committee would seek to have us deliver.  That is important as well.  I would not suggest a figure off the top of my head.  I am concerned about the fact that our budget, as Mr. Richardson mentioned, represents, I think, 0.26% of the overall Vote.  I think someone remarked that more is spent on cleaning of military installations than on the Reserve.  By any measure, that order of magnitude is wrong, we think.  However, it brings into consideration what our strategic purpose should be.  I think there is an awful lot of potential that has not been recognised in recent years.  The appropriate way to operate would be to realise what the potential is, set meaningful objectives and then construct a budget accordingly.<\/p><p> The final question Senator O'Reilly asked was about part-time work and the ethos of volunteerism.  I will pass over to our vice president, Ms McCarthy, to take that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Gargan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>The answer to Senator O'Reilly's question is \"No\".  I do not think it would damage any volunteer dimension at all.  None of us is in this organisation to make money, I can assure the Senator.  With 20 years' service and the amount of mileage and the amount of equipment you buy, it does not equate, so absolutely not.<\/p> <p>  As for the reason people are in the Reserve, they get to experience something that many other people do not.  They have a sense of camaraderie that you do not get in any other industry.  They gain experience of the Defence Forces.  As Mr. Gargan said, we operate under military law.  We take part in some robust training.  That is an incredible experience as well.  Also, reservists see their time in the Reserve as an investment in their personal careers.  They are trained up in presentation skills, leadership and communication.  Take a young person coming in at 18 and going into college and, hopefully, getting a job after two or three years of college.  They are already junior managers.  They are already trained.  They can already work with initiative.  Those are my thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jo McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Moving on to Deputy Brady's questions, he asked about engagement with the commission.  I am very happy to say we made a significant presentation to the Commission on the Defence Forces and it went very well.  The international component of the commission, that is, those who are familiar with reservists in their own countries, very much took to heart what we had to propose.  Part of that proposal was a restructuring of the Defence Forces in a way which would follow the population of the country, particularly the cohort from which we seek to recruit.  We had the engagement formally.  Also, the commission made a number of visits to military installations up until quite recently.  I think it finished the final such visit only recently.  We were quite happy that the commission met many reservists as well, not just us, so there was a very good and very meaningful engagement with the commission.  I am very happy to mention that.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Richardson to talk about recruitment campaigns.  Before I do, as for the point about stark figures, I refer to what might be called a conversion rate of those expressing an interest in joining the Army Reserve.  I am an Army reservist.  In my unit, and through the good offices of senior non-commissioned officers, NCOs, and the officers who look after recruitment in my unit, over recent years, when you amalgamate the figures, the conversion rate is 2.4%.  In other words, of all the local people in my area who wish to join the Reserve, that is the percentage that actually gets through.  Were it 24%, I would say to the committee that there was a failure in this centralised process for recruitment, but 2.4% is beyond belief.  There is a serious problem with the centralised process there.  This has to be one of the key messages.  We will come back to it before I finish.  Recruitment is essential.  We need urgently to fix recruitment before we move on.  The reason we urgently need to fix recruitment for the Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve is that we simply will not survive until such time as the recommendations, which we expect to be made by the commission, are executed.<\/p><p>As Mr. Richardson said, we are on a trajectory that is not great.  The figure of 1,500, which one of the members referred to and is in the public domain, is an ageing figure and is only going in one direction.  It is reducing and shrinking day by day, so urgent action is needed.  Once the framework of the Reserve is gone, it will be practically impossible to construct something to replace it.  An enormous opportunity will be lost at great cost to the State.  I had to mention that at this point.  I will hand over to Mr. Richardson on recruitment campaigns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Gargan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Brady's question.  He has shown an understanding of this issue.  It has been one for many years and \"timelines\" is the key word.  On average, it takes a year to 18 months for an applicant to join the Reserve, from the day he or she applies online to the day they can be sworn in or attested, which is the official word.  It can take a year to 18 months and the various stages they have to go through, be it interviews, fitness tests, medical exams or whatever it might be, can often be arranged months apart to the point that, as the Deputy quite rightly said, when people are recontacted when it is time for the next part of the recruitment process, they have simply lost interest because many months have passed since the Defence Forces last communicated with them.  The Deputy specifically mentioned 2019.  Of the several thousand applicants we had that year, 144 people were successfully attested at the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  If I go back a few more years, the figures are quite stark.  There were 4,870 applicants in 2014.  The question is often thrown at us whether an interest in joining the Reserve is still there among the public in the State.  Some 5,000 applicants for that competition, out of which we attested 157, would suggest \"yes\".  I do not believe for a moment that all these people failed their interviews, medical exams or fitness tests.  It is likely that several months after the last stage at which they were contacted they had grown uninterested.  For any organisation to take 18 months for applicants to get in the door, it is a miracle we still have 144 people left at the end of the process.  It attests to their desire to join.<\/p> <p>  Two years ago, when we last appeared before this committee, we talked about our strength figure at the time.  We are now 33% down on that strength figure.  Even with the trickle of attestations we have had over the past number of years, we are on a net loss, year-on-year.  We are now one third smaller than we were two years ago when we last appeared before this committee.  At present, that is the main problem.  We even have instances involving medical resourcing and getting Defence Force medicals for recruits, which is a massive issue in that reservists are, unfortunately, last on the list of priorities in accessing a military doctor.  Sometimes the process takes so long that the medical they get is void after a 12-month wait, so another medical is needed.  This is not only a waste of resources; it shows how long the process can go on for.<\/p> <p>  If this continues, and was to keep going for another couple of years, we could be before this committee again in two years' time saying there are 500 of us left.  As Mr. Gargan quite rightly pointed out, a certain number of personnel in certain ranks is needed in order to form a training staff for new recruits.  We are getting to the point where cobbling together training staff to train these new people will be difficult.  Even if they handed us 1,000 recruits in the morning, we may shortly get to a point where we physically cannot train them.  I have, hopefully, addressed that issue.<\/p> <p>  I would like to, however, segue into answering Senator O'Reilly's question on funding, paired with Deputy Brady's question on the budget.  As Mr. Gargan said, it is hard to put a figure on it but I will point out to Deputies and Senators the way the &euro;2.15 million is structured.  The RDF allocation in Vote 36 is designed to allow a full-strength Reserve of 4,000 personnel, with seven paid days each a year.  The idea is if there were 4,000 of us, we would all get seven paid days a year.  The problem is that most Reserve training courses are 14 days, 21 days or 28 days.  There is a problem straight away in that we will be victims of our own success if we have a full-strength Reserve since we would be asking Reservists to either undertake, possibly, 25% of a paid training course and do the rest voluntarily, which is not feasible, or we simply would not be able to attend the training course because we would not have the paid day allocation to provide.  The whole system is structured in such a way that we would be victims of our own success if we had 4,000 people.  We simply could not survive on seven paid days each a year.  That is something that will have to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  Concurrently with capital investment, as was mentioned earlier, a geographical expansion is the way to get the Reserve back up to full strength and back into communities, which was a great strength of the old FCA in decades past.  However, that would involve the renting or purchasing of suitable training facilities in the county.  At the moment, our budget is solely for pay.  However, a form of Reserve-specific capital investment would also be needed to facilitate that expansion.  It could not all be about man days, or paid days as they are referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":491,"content":"<p>When it comes to the challenges posed by reducing the size of the Reserve, the effect of the decline in numbers gets to a point where we step off a cliff.  A critical mass of suitably qualified personnel is required in order to undertake tasks.  For example, if we want to go onto an firing range, we have to have a security party, a working party and those who doing their annual range practices.  We cannot do that with a small number of people.  We have to have the right number of people.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, if we are going to train people, we have to have the right number of suitably qualified instructors.  On that point, going closer to home and looking at the typical age profile in my unit, a Reservist is now in their early 40s.  This causes problems.  It is a problem long in the making because recruitment has been so poorly executed over the past number of years it is now starting to manifest in not having junior leaders; it is difficult to identify people to go on potential officer courses because they simply do not have the numbers and it means we are challenged when it comes to training the recruits we get in.  If we were able to magically fling the doors open and solve the numbers problem by recruiting, that in itself will be a major challenge for us at this stage because the infrastructure, in terms of personnel and resources available, has been run down to a stage where it is barely in existence.  Ramping it back up again will be a challenge.  <\/p> <p>  There was a question on the ideal size of the Reserve.  For our submission to the commission, we had a discussion on this, we thought about it long and hard and we decided we would make our pitch based on the 4,000-odd number.  We are talking about aiming to get back to where we should be now.  That would be a reasonable first step rather than looking at international comparators, which sometimes look at a factor, between the permanent Defence Forces and the Reserve, or a possible order of magnitude, of one-to-one or one-to-two.  That would actually be too challenging.  That is a long-term goal we might look at, but even to get back to where we should be will take a significant effort.  It is not just money.  It takes other military resources as well.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady also asked about employment protection.  We have probably addressed that.  There is a lot to be done and a lot that could be done without any unforeseen consequences.  For example, we could establish other grounds for anti-discrimination in the workplace.  There are a number of grounds already and something as simple as saying that someone who is a current or former member of the Defence Forces ought not to be discriminated against, could be easily put together and would be an excellent first step.  <\/p> <p>  On the questions about engagement with the Minister, I am quite happy to report that engagement with this Minister is very positive and very good.  He certainly sees the value of the Reserve and he also understands the challenges we are facing.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Gargan"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Stanton who, our guests will be aware, has some direct experience of the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#F00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I am in Leinster House.  I again welcome our guests.  I met some of them a number of years ago.  It is sad to see things have not progressed very much since then.  In fact, they have gone the other way.  As the Chairman said, I was a member of the RDF, which was called the FCA for 23 years.<\/p><p>When I got elected to the D&aacute;il, I got a letter from the President saying my services were no longer required as an officer on the Reserve.  You cannot do both, but that is okay.  I was probably getting too old for it anyway, because I could not keep up with the young fellas when they were doing route marches and stuff at that stage.  I wondered why but age has a bearing.  It is a good organisation for young people.  <\/p><p> I will pick up on something Ms McCarthy said which I have believed strongly in for quite a bit.  It concerns the role the Reserve plays in developing personality, self-confidence, leadership, presentation skills, citizenship and so on.  I have mentioned it previously and have direct experience of it.  I have seen young boys and girls joining the Reserve quite timid and, with the training and support they got, their CVs were enriched enormously.  <\/p><p> On the role the Reserve plays as a recruitment mechanism for the PDF, we found it disturbing that our best soldiers often joined the PDF once they got a feel for military life and liked it.  At the moment, the PDF is having a problem with recruitment.  When I was in the FCA, in 1991 the establishment was 22,000 people, mainly young people.  The strength in December 1991 was 15,293.  The number who attended training camp in 1990 was almost 7,500 young people.  That was normally two weeks fully paid.  That was a lot of money and good pay for youngsters in college or just after doing the leaving certificate.  It helped many people make their way into the world.  There are other strengths with respect to the Reserve that have to be recognised.  It is not just the military side.  As has been said here, the main focus is on augmenting the PDF, but there are other values and strengths. <\/p><p> Canada has a cadet programme for teenagers from 12 to 18.  They are inducted and do all kinds of training under the auspices of the army, navy and air force in Canada.  Listening to the radio on the way up today, I heard a debate about many young people in Ireland having nothing to do and all night to do it.  They are hanging around the streets with nowhere to go, which brings me back to the issue of the closure of training places.  Senators Wilson and Joe O'Reilly spoke on this as well.  People need places to go if they are to train.  These were often large halls where people could march and so forth.  It was useful from that point of view.  The establishment is 4,069.  That is what the strength should be, but the actual number is way down at 1,513.  Will our guests comment on the Naval Service Reserve?  The number there is 125 and the establishment is quite small at, I think, 200.  I am interested in that.  We are visiting the naval base on Friday and I would like to see that area focused on.  <\/p><p> I think it was in 2019 that Mr. Gargan spoke about the expenses that members of the Reserve incur in travelling to training centres, purchasing equipment and so on.  I think Ms McCarthy said it as well.  Reservists are owed money because there have been changes made to the funding.  There used to be a gratuity at the end of every year and it was scrapped.  There is the issue of pooling equipment, which is unhygienic.<\/p><p> What issues from the White Paper would the witnesses like to see implemented straight away?  They mentioned that none of them has been.  Are there priorities the witnesses have?  Can they point to best practice in other countries?  Can they point to any country in Europe we should emulate?  I ask about witnesses' contact with &Oacute;glaigh N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na h&Eacute;ireann-Organisation for National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE.  I was at the opening of a hostel for ONE in Cobh last Sunday, Br&uacute; na Farraige, where five bedrooms were established for members of the PDF who might have fallen on hard times.  I am interested to know the connection.  I understand former members of the Reserve can become members of the ONE.  Do the witnesses encourage or support that or bring it to people's attention?  At that event, they constantly referred to me as a veteran.  I am not sure if that is a good or bad thing but that was the term they used.<\/p><p> We look forward to the commission's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#F00500","speaker":"1515","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their opening statement.  It was a comprehensive, fairly grim but accurate assessment of where we are.  Honestly is always a good place to start.<\/p> <p>  I will raise three questions.  The first is in light of the legislation that will probably be signed off by the President in the coming weeks to allow Reserve Defence Forces people deploy overseas.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on when the first member of the Reserve will deploy overseas?  I seek a ballpark answer.  Second, there is an Army Reserve and a Naval Service Reserve but no Air Corps reserve.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on establishing one?  The Air Corps is under-strength at the moment.  Most modern countries have an air force reserve.  Why is Ireland so special that it does not have one?  Is it something we should consider?  The last question is on the employment protection legislation.  I like the way the opening statement coupled potential employment protection legislation with an employer support package.  That is a good twinning and a good way to go.  I take the point we need to liaise with various stakeholders like IBEC and ISME before something as significant as this is introduced but surely in the public sector we should get our own house in order first.  As a first incremental step, what are the witnesses' thoughts on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform putting out a circular to all Departments that where we have a full-time member of the public service who is also a reservist in the Defence Forces, if that person is deployed overseas or at home in operations, their employment is protected and their job will be available when the period of emergency or of deployment overseas ends?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#G00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I do not want to ask any questions.

It is important that people feel comfortable and believe they can progress.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the youth.  Troubled youth may have been dealt a bad card deal and deserve another chance.  Giving them a chance to join the Reserve gives them a support system and discipline.

The Reserve Defence Force and its predecessors, An F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il and An Slua Muir&iacute;, have traditionally been a very effective channel for recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force.  It was a very attractive channel from the Permanent Defence Force&rsquo;s perspective because those recruited through it did not enter military life unaccustomed to it.  Therefore, the dropout rate was understandably very low.  Recruits hit the road running and there was a fairly effective conversion rate.  In fact, it was often said that it was a major problem in terms of natural wastage.  So many were people leaving the ranks of the Reserve to go into the Permanent Defence Force that it caused a bit of a problem.  It was not a bad problem to have, and we were happy to do our best in that regard.  As a result of the trend in question, a high number of former members of the Reserve and former direct colleagues are in the Permanent Defence Force.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about the other strengths and social benefits.  I believe the Deputy was talking about the other socio-economic benefits that accrue from military service.  Deputy Berry is a fine example of someone who has come through the Defence Forces and who has launched another career, or multiple careers in his case.  There is an awful lot to be gained from military service.  As Ms McCarthy mentioned, it instils a sense of <i>esprit de corps<\/i>.  One adopts the values of the Defence Forces.  For a great number of people, it is an expression of their patriotism and service to the State.  That can only be welcomed as a good thing.  However, back when the much-discredited value-for-money report was put together, there was zero value put on any of these factors.  No value was placed on any social benefit to the community whatsoever.  It was strictly lined up with military benefit.  That is a difficulty.  The report did not take an holistic approach, accounting for the benefit of the Reserve to the State as a whole.  That was a significant shortcoming.  I will not get into the issue of the value-for-money report because we have not prepared for it.  That is another chapter in history.<br\/><br\/>On the Naval Service Reserve numbers, I will hand over to Mr. Richardson.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about having referred to the expense of serving in the Reserve when I last spoke.  The point made was true.  I am not an accountant but if we were to keep a tally of what we spend on fuel, tolls, maintenance of our uniforms, buying kit and not getting paid for the majority of what we do, we would certainly note we are out of pocket.<br\/><br\/>The withdrawal of the gratuity scheme was said to fund additional man days.  We were told that we would get back in one pocket what we lost from the other.  That simply has not happened.  Many of us feel that we continue to pay a price for our service.  We do not do it for money.  There are other drivers that keep us connected and serving.  As Ms McCarthy mentioned, it is all about being part of a bigger organisation and service to the State.<br\/><br\/>On the White Paper projects, the White Paper is a bit dated at this stage.  I will ask Mr. Richardson to give an update on his thoughts on this matter.  We have been waiting for quite a while for something to come of the White Paper projects.  The White Paper was launched to a fanfare several years ago but it has not delivered anything for us.  That is simply a matter of fact.  It is very disappointing that it has not delivered anything.  To be blunt about it, we have more significant concerns at this stage.  Our very survival as an entity is what we are worried about now.  We talked in the foyer outside about whether this is the last time we will get to come in here.  Will we be in existence in a couple of years?  I cannot overstate this point.  I do not mean to be overly negative because there is a positive to be brought to the members&rsquo; attention also.  I will get to that towards the end.  We are not that concerned about the White Paper at this stage; we are more concerned about the commission and being able to stay in existence until its recommendations, which we expect to be positive, are executed, and not delayed or stalled in any shape or form.<br\/><br\/>On best practice and the other questions, I will hand over to Mr. Richardson.  Before doing so, I will make a last point, on ONE.  ONE is a marvellous organisation.  I was present for the launch of its campaign, the Fuchsia appeal.  The organisation does tremendous work.  It serves several purposes.  It does fabulous work looking after our veterans.  It was quite keen to redefine the term &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; to mean anybody who had served.  I would not take it as a reflection on the Deputy&rsquo;s age, particularly coming from someone like me, who marked 35 years of service in the Reserve this week.  I am not quite a veteran just yet.  I endorse the work of ONE.  Many of our former members are in it.  We help them whenever we can.<br\/><br\/>I will now pass over to Mr. Richardson, who will take the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Gargan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I will address Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s outstanding questions in sequence.  On the Naval Service Reserve figures, the establishment of the Naval Service Reserve is currently 200 personnel, of all ranks.  It has an effective strength of 121.  The strength figure is at about 67% of establishment, whereas the Army Reserve figure is at about 37%.  Percentage-wise, the Naval Service Reserve is not faring as badly as the Army Reserve.  However, the 2015 White Paper stated the Naval Service Reserve&rsquo;s establishment would be increased by another 100 personnel so it should be at 300.  Again, this is one of the White Paper projects that has yet to be initiated.  We would argue it is quite a simple one to initiate but, six years later, the Naval Service Reserve&rsquo;s establishment still sits at 200.<\/p> <p>  On what we can do with the Naval Service Reserve, I say begrudgingly as a proud Army reservist that because we are an island nation, the maritime aspect of the Defence Forces deserves serious input.  The Naval Service Reserve could easily be expanded to other coastal locations throughout the State.  An obvious example is Galway, because there is a permanently manned barracks in D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa.<\/p><p>One would not be seeking to purchase another Reserve training facility as there is one there already.  We understand that Galway Port might be developed in future years and it would be nice to have a Naval Service Reserve unit based there.  That is just one of many locations around the State where Naval Service Reserve units could be placed.  They are a particularly underutilised aspect of the Reserve Defence Force, and it should be 100 personnel larger then it is currently given the level of establishment that has yet to be initiated.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Stanton asked about White Paper issues for implementation.  I can only reiterate what Mr. Gargan has said.  We have moved on so much from the White Paper.  The White Paper states that the two reasons for the Reserve to exist is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in times of crisis and to carry out State ceremonial events as and when required.  The first one is quite a vague support purpose.  It is not even defined in the document as to what a crisis situation might be.  We would argue that Covid-19 definitely qualifies as a crisis event, yet for the most part the Reserve was not utilised during the Covid-19 pandemic.  If the pandemic does not meet the definition of a crisis then we do not know what does.  We have definitely moved on past the White Paper.  It can even be seen in the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020.  This Bill is to give us an operational output.  This is so far beyond what the White Paper was willing to provide for the Reserve. The White Paper issues are really yesterday's concern at this stage.<br\/><br\/>With regard to other countries we can use as examples, this goes back to an earlier question by Deputy Brady, the UK is worth looking at with its SaBRE organisation, which is an employer engagement body.  It is an intermediary between civil employers and the defence industry.  Essentially, it translates army-speak into civilian talk and<i>vice versa<\/i>New Zealand and Australia are also very good examples of where it has worked very well.<br\/><br\/>I will speak briefly of something that the Australians do that really sells the benefits of defence to employers.  It is a Department of Defence programme called &quot;exercise boss lift&quot;.  Essentially, they take civilian employers and put them through a rudimentary form of military training, or at the very least bring them along to a training facility to show them what their employees are getting up to while they are away, and showing them the benefits of this.  It gives them a soft introduction to military life.  In many ways it is seen as an advertisement for the wider defence industry.  It gives employers an understanding of the value of the training that these reservist employees receive when they are away, and the benefits to the companies when these reservist employees come back.<br\/><br\/>Obviously, the military does 99% of its work behind a barracks wall and often what exactly the military does or what its benefits are not visible to the civilian body or private industry.  Once that metaphorical wall comes down, all of a sudden employers start to see the wealth of qualifications that reservist employees can attain and, from the civilian employers perspective, for free.  This experience is something their employees obtain while away on military service and the employers are not putting their hands in their pockets in order to provide this training to their employees.  The UK, Australia and New Zealand would be the countries to look at.  I will pass back to Mr. Gargan now to address Deputy Berry's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Deputy Berry's questions are excellent, as usual.  The first of those three questions was, given the legislation, when would we see overseas service.  We touched on this earlier and there is no reason that could not happen almost immediately.  There are obviously a couple of prerequisites around the training and the provision of other resources to ensure that we have the right people to go overseas.  At this stage, however, it would be limited as to who would be able to go.  There will probably be a requirement to have a look at the employment protection.  We are back to that again. The employment protection is a broad issue.  One approach could be to make small changes to the periphery of the corpus of legislation and see how that could work or one could take a broader approach by saying that we want tie this in with the broader strategic purpose of the Reserve.  What is it there to do?  Are we there, for example when it comes to service overseas?  Are we there to provide back up to the PDF and fill the slots that they cannot fill in particular or specialist roles?  Is there a target where we would make up a small percentage of, for example, a contingent serving overseas?  I would favour the latter because such a function would pull along all of the other procedures such as training and standards in order to provide personnel for such a duty.<\/p> <p>  On the potential for an Air Corps reserve, this was often mentioned when I would meet with colleagues in the Air Corps.  They would ask why we were not out there and flying along with them.  In our submission to the commission we made a proposal that would provide for an Air Corps reserve, albeit not aloft.  Perhaps Mr. Richardson will talk a little bit more about that.  Our submission on this is based on a model a bit like the RAF reserve garrison operates.  There is certainly potential for that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of employment protection.  I believe that the Deputy's intention was asking where do we start to protect reservists who are serving in the public and Civil Service.  It is a bit like the old saying of charity beginning at home.  I believe that the State can set the tone and could actually embark upon making the changes for those who serve the State, through the Civil Service and public service, and to protect them.<\/p> <p>  There is a circular, if memory serves me it is circular No. 51\/1979, which provides for a number of days leave for service in the FCA.  That was contingent upon approval by management and so on.  It only went so far as looking at training from the FCA point of view.  Absolutely we would endorse that idea and it would be a starting place.  It would certainly send a signal that the State and the Government is very serious about employment protection for reservists.  It would also serve as a test bed for showing how it would actually work.  One would get over the issues of the person being absent from their role: how it would be backfilled; how functions are dealt with when the person leaves and returns; and questions relating to the person's insurance, pension entitlement and pay.  All of these types of things would have to be sorted out.  These are just the details behind it but the principle is a good one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Gargan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>On the Air Corps reserve, in our proposal it is our view that the future Reserve should incorporate PDF service leavers with all of their wealth of experience and qualifications, and what could be defined as the citizen volunteer reservist, which is the person with no previous full-time military service.  How would an Air Corps reserve work?  More than likely the pilot or the specialist side of things would be predominantly, if not exclusively, taken up with PDF service leavers.  Citizen volunteer reservists could perform other ancillary roles in support of that.  The Air Corps is a fertile ground for adding a reserve because, as the Deputy has quite rightly said, there has not ever been such a reserve.  Certainly, there are areas where a reserve could assist.  Part of our submission was a rejigging of the first line reserve.  I am aware that the Deputy is familiar with this.  PDF service leavers who are retained on a list are referred to as the first line reserve.  The Army Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve are actually the second line reserve.  The first line reserve is a body of PDF service leavers who are retained and who can be recalled for various reasons.  This force was established in the post-Emergency period, which was back in the mid-1940s, ostensibly with no establishment figure and with no real idea as to how it could be properly utilised.  These individuals did attend for an annual refresher training once a year until the 1980s when numbers dropped so low that annual refresher training was discontinued.  We would see this is very much missing a trick.  If there are individuals who are PDF service leavers, with their wealth of qualifications and years of experience, they should be utilised for the benefit of the State in defence and to work with us in the second line reserve as reservists in the first line reserve.  This is an area where active first line reservists could work in tandem with active second line reservists, which is what we represent.  Certainly, there is fertile ground to establish an Air Corps reserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":507,"content":"<p>The next questions came from Deputy Cowen with regard to the Air Corps.  I think we have just answered that.  Reference was made also to recruitment.  If there is only one thing members of the committee take away from this discussion today it is that recruitment is absolutely essential.  It is an urgent issue that goes to the very heart of our existence.  It needs to be addressed absolutely and quickly.<\/p> <p>  I will make another point, which touches on the sentiment expressed by the Deputy in his comments.  I have often said that the status and the state of the Reserve is a bellwether.  It is an indicator generally of the health of the Defence Forces overall.<\/p><p>One could argue that if things are going well for the Reserve Defence Force then it is a reasonable assumption to make that throughout the other branches and echelons of the Defence Forces, things are going well also.  In many ways, we are at the end of the conveyor belt.  We are at the end of the list of things to be done.  When Mr. Richardson talked about getting recruits through the medical checks, security clearances and all that kind of stuff, because it is dealing with the Reserve Defence Force, we get pushed to the end of the queue.<\/p><p> Understandably, I suppose, if Permanent Defence Force members are about to serve overseas or undertake various duties then it is essential to get them sorted out first.  That is fine.  We have never had a problem with that.  The problem arises when we remain at the back of the queue and are never processed or do not get the resources required, ever.  We do not progress from there.  I would say, therefore, that it is a key indicator of how things are.  If the Reserve Defence Force is doing well then one could assume that the rest of the Defence Forces are doing well.<\/p><p> One might look at it from the other perspective, that is, from the point of view of our colleagues in the more specialist roles.  I picked the particular example of our comrades in the Army Ranger Wing, ARW.  If we look at their experiences of late in trying to secure their pay and allowances and the difficulties they have had then it does not bode well for us.  If they, as the tip of the spear - the very people and experts who are at the top of their profession and who are sent into the most hostile of places, including Kabul recently - have difficulties then where are we going to be?  There are, therefore, two ways of looking at this.  There is a continuum of expertise, if you like, and there is a continuum in a military context of where we are at.  I wanted to make the point that that is a concern to us as well.<\/p><p> The final question then was from Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, which came via Deputy Brady, regarding 32-county recruitment.  I am happy to take that question because, as I mentioned earlier, I am originally from County Cavan.  I live in Dublin but I am posted in the 27 Infantry Battalion, which is headquartered in Dundalk.  I am very proud to serve with the 27 Infantry Battalion.  I can tell members that a significant number of personnel, both Permanent Defence Force and Reserve Defence Force, are from the Six Counties or from the North.  They are quite happy to serve.  They really want to serve and they make the journey down.  It is quite surprising that some of our potential recruits have actually come from Belfast.  That, I suppose, tells members something about the intent and the desire to serve that these people have.  They are very keen.  That is actually effectively happening already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eugene Gargan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gargan for that.

What happened following the 2013 reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force is that independent reserve units were stood down and post this date, all reservists have served as previously permanent-only units.  To give an example, in Dublin, we would have the 7 Infantry Battalion based in Cathal Brugha Barracks.  Headquarters, A and B companies and support companies will be permanent soldiers and C, D and E companies will be reservists.  They are, therefore, all under the one flag, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  Unique reservist stand-alone training camps have sort of disappeared really since 2013.  What now generally happens is that reservists will go on training with their Permanent Defence Force counterparts or they will be penny-packeted out to various training courses.  Reservists are still attending a form of what would have been traditionally been called \"annual camp\" but it just might not be a concentration of reservists only anymore.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned 2019 and the hiatus on training camps.  Yes, 2019 was our last normal training year.  We have quoted the number of individuals who attended for paid training in that year.  It was 1,019 individuals.  At a time when the Reserve Defence Force had an official strength of 1,588 individuals, which is 75 more than it does now, we would argue that the 1,019 people who attended for paid training in 2019 was a far more accurate metric of how many active reservists we had.  Those 1,019 people attended at least one paid day each that year.  We would argue that the other 500 were just remnants on the personnel management system and are not necessarily there anymore in reality.<\/p> <p>  The arrival of Covid-19 in 2020 unfortunately resulted more or less in a shutdown of all normal Reserve Defence Force activity.  It is worth stating that reservists did exist on Operation Fortitude, that is, the Defence Forces operation in support of the HSE.  Generally, however, swab testers and vaccinators ultimately appeared in time but these were individuals who had a specialist qualification.  The vast majority of the Reserve Defence Force was, therefore, stood down.<\/p> <p>  There has been a resumption of training camps again in 2021 albeit, I will say, of a particularly refined nature.  A \"reserve concentration\", for want of a better phrase, took place in Kilworth Camp in County Cork during August, where two high-profile Reserve Defence Force courses resumed along with local support staff who came in.  The irony perhaps is the 150 to 200 reservists who were present on the camp probably represented maybe 20% of what is left in the Reserve Defence Force.  To most long-serving reservists from decades past, 200 individuals was a drop in the ocean in comparison to the numbers that attended reservist training in years gone by.  What we are considering a high number now, therefore, would have been very bad year 20 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021100500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Neil Richardson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked the question then about whether those in the service of the State, that is, the public service and Civil Service, can have some form of employment protection.

I work in the private sector so I have never been able to invoke it directly like that.  It allows for a number of days off, however.  I think there are implications in terms of superannuation payments as well.  If, therefore, a person spends every year throughout his or her working life taking a week or two off, it can have an implication towards the end of his or her working career.

I am joined today by Rory Fitzgerald, who is a Samaritans volunteer and regional director for the Republic of Ireland, and Sarah Stack, our communications and policy manager.<\/p> <p>  Samaritans is the only 24-hour freephone emotional support helpline covering the entire island of Ireland.  We are a volunteer-led organisation with more than 2,000 volunteers in 21 branches, and we have 12 core staff.  We believe every life lost to suicide is a tragedy, and we work tirelessly to reach more people and make suicide prevention a priority.  Coronavirus has undoubtedly been the most serious challenge Samaritans has faced in our 60 years in Ireland.  When restrictions were enforced, volunteers and branch directors worked hard to adapt to new safety guidelines to ensure our branches could remain open and safe for all our volunteers coming in.  At one stage of the pandemic, up to 40% of our volunteers were cocooning, either to protect themselves or to protect a family member.  Despite this, we remained open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This achievement was down to our remaining volunteers signing up for additional shifts each week, sometimes two, three or four shifts.  In the first 12 months of coronavirus restrictions, we listened for more than 100,000 hours.  Our volunteers received approximately 1,500 calls and emails for help every day and without their dedication those calls for support would have gone unanswered, and our callers would have been left unheard.<\/p> <p>  Throughout 2020, and into 2021, loneliness and isolation remained among the top reasons people called Samaritans.  We also supported people with a mental health crisis &ndash; some whose services were impacted by restrictions - and thousands of people with family or relationship issues, job or financial insecurity worries, people experiencing bereavement, and high levels of anxiety over the coronavirus pandemic.  More recently, callers are discussing their anxieties over the easing of restrictions, their fears associated with this easing, and a return to the new normal.  We have noted a number of key findings from our work in 2020.  Samaritans volunteers answered a call for help every 56 seconds.  While one in three callers mentioned coronavirus directly, our volunteers reported it was a feature in almost every call.  Our busiest time of day was from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., when more than a quarter of our daily calls were answered.  We maintained our listener support scheme in Irish prisons and will mark 20 years of supporting the prison population in Ireland in 2022.  The way in which anxieties were discussed evolved over the pandemic from at first being primarily rooted in health concerns, that is, the caller, or a loved one, were going to contract Covid-19, to concerns around the lasting implications of the virus, and in particular the potential ongoing socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  While our 24-hour helpline and email service are core to what we do, Samaritans is also a lead agency in supporting and training other NGOs in their work with vulnerable people, particularly people who are at high risk of emotional distress, self-harm, and suicide.  The impact of the pandemic on the public led to groups and organisations, not usually working in the area of mental health and well-being, beginning to receive distressing or suicidal calls.  We responded to requests from numerous organisations to offer our support and expertise to their staff and volunteers on how to support their callers.  For some organisations offering services over the telephone or virtually for the first time introduced challenges around meeting best practices on data protection and security, and we provided resources to meet these challenges.<\/p> <p>  We continue to work with the staff and volunteers of organisations who are working in areas such as addiction, homelessness, long-term unemployment, and domestic and sexual violence, and we work with members of the Traveller community, prisoners, members of the LGBTI+ community and with people living in rural isolation.  We train staff and volunteers on how to listen and support people who are going through difficult times or those who are in crisis.  Equally, we train the staff and volunteers to look out for each other and to look after each other.<\/p> <p>  Though our face-to-face training was suspended at the start of Covid-19 restrictions, we were able to adapt our training programmes to the online environment.  While this was at times a challenge, an unexpected outcome of online training is that we are now able to support people and groups in some of the most rural parts of the country, whom we previously may not have been able to reach.  While we look forward to returning to face-to-face sessions, we also recognise the value of being able to maintain an online training and workshop presence.<\/p> <p>  Even before the pandemic, we supported six different helplines to divert callers into our own freephone helpline, 116 123.  When their lines close after hours, callers are invited to stay on the line to be transferred to a Samaritans volunteer if they wish.  This was done to offer a more cohesive response to a person in distress and acts as a safety net for the caller.  It has proven to be vital for someone who may need support when other agencies are closed.<\/p> <p>  In partnership with the Government's emigrant support programme, we also provide our listening service to the Irish diaspora living in certain countries overseas.  We launched the service in 2018 in the United Arab Emirates, China, Hong Kong, and Poland, and this was extended over Christmas 2020 to also include Canada and Australia.  These helplines have been especially helpful over the past 18 months to support those expatriates facing additional hardships from Covid-19 or who were unable to travel home due to ongoing restrictions.<\/p> <p>  Being there and listening to others in need is at the heart of what Samaritans across Ireland does.  Our volunteers dutifully stepped up in this national crisis, they kept our services going when people needed us to be there for them, and they answered more than half a million calls in 2020.<\/p><p>We are immensely proud of the role that each every one of our volunteers has played and continues to play during the pandemic crisis.  They were there to offer their support at every hour of every day to anyone who needed someone to talk to.  For that, we thank them wholeheartedly.  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their time today.  We welcome any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Mulligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I thank the Samaritans very much for giving us a wonderful presentation today.

I would like to echo the Chair's words.  I, too, thank the Samaritans for its hard work over the last year.  Ireland has never needed the work that the Samaritans do more than during such a turbulent time.  We are all well aware of the crucial supports that the Samaritans give to people.<\/p> <p>  There are a few aspects of Mr. Mulligan's presentation in which I was very interested.  He sent us an excellent document which outlined all of the work that the Samaritans does.  There are a couple of areas that I would like, if possible, the witnesses from the Samaritans to expand upon.  Maybe they can outline the particular challenges of those aspects, and how we can support them.  First, I was interested in the Samaritans' co-operative initiative with ALONE.  That is an interesting thing to do, that is, to co-operate with a group that speaks to a particular group in society.  Could they expand on that and say whether they have considered taking that model and applying it to different groups?

The partnership with ALONE came about because we were aware from our conversations with it, as well as from seeing some social media coverage of the levels of suicidal ideation and distress that were being experienced by people who had been ringing ALONE.  We reached out to ALONE to see if there was anything that we could do to help it.  The partnership with ALONE is twofold.  First, while some of our volunteers were cocooning, they could do some volunteering with ALONE because they could work and volunteer from home.  That was not an option within the Samaritans.  We came to an arrangement with ALONE.<\/p> <p>  The second part was in relation to some individuals who had been ringing ALONE volunteers, and who were under severe distress.  We entered into a memorandum of understanding, MoU, between ALONE and the Dublin Samaritans branch, whereby if those individuals wanted to, they could be contacted by the Samaritans.  That was a real help in terms of using our expertise and experience in the areas suicidal ideation and deep distress, so that we could support those individuals.  There are lots of positives around this partnership.<\/p> <p>  The only challenges that arose were ensuring that the protocols that were set up - for instance, ALONE's protocols around confidentiality, etc. - would match with our own protocols.  The challenges arose within the processes, rather than in any deep issues around value bases, or anything along those lines.

Of all the groups during Covid-19, it was particularly challenging for older people, who had been asked to cocoon for such a long time.  On a similar issue, I see in the documentation that the Samaritans works with prisons and with those who are in prison.  I can imagine that was particularly challenging during Covid-19, as access to prisons was less available.  Obviously, technology is also constrained in prisons.

It was a challenge, there is no doubt about it.  There were no Covid-19 cases in the Irish Prison Service or in Irish prisons for a long period of the pandemic.  One of the reasons behind that was that the access that we would normally have as an organisation was not available, and rightly so.  It left us in difficulty, because the scheme we operate in the Irish Prison Service is about training up inmates to give peer support to their fellow inmates.  However, the inmates carried on doing that anyway.  Over a period of time, we organised supporting our listeners within the prison via the medium of Zoom, etc.  While it was not ideal, it was the best that we and Irish Prison Service could do.  The Irish Prison Service was hugely supportive of us trying to be innovative in how we supported listeners in the prisons.<\/p> <p>  Another thing that came about was a pilot scheme within some of the prisons around having in-cell phones, from which prisoners could ring the Samaritans and seek support.

My final question is also on the technology issue.  I have met Mr. Mulligan before.  I have been impressed over the last 18 months with the innovation of online chat.  Many people, particularly younger groups, might find online chat to be an easier format for contacting the Samaritans, easier to get their head around, and easier to engage with.  Has the Samaritans found that online chat is particularly interesting to particular groups?  Does it have the technological support to roll out that technology?

The Samaritans has piloted it.  As the Deputy knows, the Samaritans is part of a wider organisation across the UK and Ireland.  There have been a number of online chat pilots in the UK.  Three branches in Northern Ireland have signed up to online chat as well, if I am correct.  It is has been a success.  We have not yet introduced in the Republic of Ireland.  We are in the process of doing that.  There are two main challenges.  The first is the technology side but we are on top of that.  It is in our work plan.  We had hoped to have it in place before the end of this year.  However, other things have taken precedence, certainly from a Covid-19 perspective.  The second is a resource issue in terms of volunteer time.  Again, there has been pressure on us.  As mentioned earlier, there is pressure on our volunteers.<\/p> <p>  Having said that, it is key to provide additional supports particularly to younger people, but also to other groups of people.

Such problems can occur at any time of the day and on any day of the week.  If a service is not open to people when they are experiencing emotional distress, it can be quite a frightening place for them.  Had people calling between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m., and it was mentioned that a quarter of calls were received during those hours, tried to contact other services?

That is interesting, especially about the news aspect.  We met young people who said that they were sitting down in anticipation when new restrictions were due to be announced by the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste, because they knew that information would impact their daily lives.  It would impact on whether they could return to playing Gaelic games, go back dancing or go back to school.  It was possible to see increased anxiety among young people when the news was coming on.  I know from my children that it is a big thing for them to be interested in the news and to be sitting around waiting for announcements to be made by the Taoiseach.  It was possible to see the impact that was having.<\/p> <p>  I have one more question.  I apologise for having to pop off then because I have another meeting to get to.  I read the comprehensive impact report that the Samaritans sent to the committee entitled, Always Here No Matter What: A Year of Listening.  It was a good report.  I am always interested in the evidence-based research that any group is carrying out.  One point that struck me concerned the stigma associated with mental health problems.  The report refers to such stigma, stating, \"A number of participants volunteered examples of feeling judged, feeling concerned about confidentiality and being mistreated.\"  Has that stigma increased or decreased in recent years?  Anecdotally, I hear many younger people talking about mental health issues and I can see stigmas being broken on that level.  On another level, though, it is possible to see people who are anxious about coming out and seeking health for their mental health issues.  How does the organisation think that we can best combat stigma in this regard and make it easier for people to come forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#C00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":539,"content":"<p>The world is improving when it comes to attitudes to mental health.

I have worked within the community and voluntary sector for 35 years in many different areas.  Stigma is always a key barrier to people accessing services.  That includes external stigma, which might relate to mental health, addiction or people's background or upbringing.  Internalised stigma is a whole other area.  Even if external stigma is cleared away, internalised stigma brings people in on themselves.  It is crucial for us to deal with that issue through the provision of services and to recognise it and to name it.  Stigma, therefore, is a major issue.

It was nice to have a good news story until they came to the latest exchange with Mr. Fitzgerald on funding.  I am amazed at the coverage that they have managed to maintain, even over the pace of 2020.  I read some of the reports and I noted that.  Often, when we talk to younger people, it is about doing things outside the box.  Samaritans, a long time ago, would have been perceived to be run by the church or something, and people did not have much confidence in it.  That has changed, with face-to-face meetings, Zoom and Teams calls and even emails.  It is amazing.  I read the statistics.  They show nearly 11,500 emails in the Republic of Ireland and nearly 12,500 in Northern Ireland.  It is probably the only all-island organisation.  I was delighted to see that it is in collaboration with other groups and it is looking at piloting more, which was a barrier in this country.  Many different groups, volunteers and NGOs were all trying to do the right thing but they all had different plans.  That joined-up thinking certainly is the way to go.<\/p> <p>  They covered the prisons, the Traveller community, and of course, the older people during Covid.  However, I was also thinking about people with disabilities and the farming community as well.  During the pandemic, we have received many calls from these people.  Samaritans offers a 24-7 service which, as many of us in recent meetings have said, should be a priority for any Government, no matter who is in power.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan also mentioned schools.  My main questions are on schools because education is key.  By educating people, the stigma can be removed because they will know what they are talking about and fear of not knowing is normally an easy way to stigmatise something.<\/p> <p>  Mental health in the workplace was mentioned.  There are significant difficulties in this regard.  We have had it over the years.  The best example is somebody serving in the Army who is due to be deployed, say, to the Lebanon, and use live rounds.  If that individual mentioned any inkling of a mental health difficulty, his or her chances of promotion or overseas work would be gone for telling the truth and being honest.  That is a big worry.<\/p> <p>  Has the organisation met resistance in any school to going in and talking about this because it has been mentioned in previous meetings?  I can recall going into schools well over ten years ago.  One would have to be careful of which age group one was dealing with.  I met a lot of resistance.  The perception was that if we spoke about mental health, it put ideas into people's heads and I always countered that by saying if you give somebody &euro;20 to put petrol or diesel into the car it does not mean necessarily that he or she will crash it.  How can that stigma be broken down?  A great deal of money - in Australia, it is over &euro;1 billion - has been put into mental health provision.  What would be the Samaritans' Christmas wish list or Christmas present for this year?  I suspect that this is only the tip of the iceberg when people are coming out of Covid and realising they have lost jobs.  They could have lost marriages, homes and so on.  There could be a tsunami of mental health issues and Samaritans needs support.  If they could respond on the education question, the workplace, prisons and their wish list, I would be delighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#D01800","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Schools is a passion of mine in that I have run a number of workshops in the south east in the past seven or eight years where we work with a drama company.  That introduces the subject.  The children are very open.  We deal with 15-year-olds, 16-year-olds in transition year up to the leaving certificate class.  Schools are very welcoming.  That would be a workshop for approximately an hour and a half and we would have a mental health expert with us on the panel.  It helps because a kid might hear something and five years down the road, when he or she is struggling, say there is help to be got wherever.  Unfortunately, there is a cost to it.  It probably costs a tenner a kid to run those workshops.  Within our funding in local branches, we do not have access to those funds.  We have to find them elsewhere.  It is something I would like to see developed nationally, particularly in third-level colleges.  The third-level colleges is a key area as well where we need to be more visible.  Our challenge is that we have 1,600 volunteers in the Republic and we would struggle to run a workshop in every school in the country.<\/p><p> One of our asks is for members of the general public to join, and we ask public representatives at all times to encourage people to join us, because the more volunteers that we have then the more we can do.  The Deputy is right.  From my experience of working in schools I know that we are getting through to people because a feedback sheet is completed after a workshop and most of the comments are positive.  One child in Enniscorthy wrote, \"I now know more about my mental health than I did an hour and half ago\".  Even though mental health is a subject that is all over the place one still needs a direct initiative.  We have found that drama engages students and we use a professionally written script.

We work in both places.  We can only do so much, and certainly within the workplace, due to resources.  The Samaritans have developed various apps for well-being in the workplace, which we work with companies around.  We work with staff, encourage them to look after their own mental health and show them how to pick up signs that a member of the staff team or an employee is struggling.  It is an important part of our work that the general public probably do not know about.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of general wishes.  As the Deputy mentioned earlier, the Samaritans organisation does not work on its own.  We work as part of a wider network.  There are other organisations like ourselves that work in the area of mental health.  We very much work together as much as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  There are certain asks in terms of the forthcoming budget, which will be familiar to members.  The Samaritans and others have called for an additional &euro;85 million to be allocated towards mental health services with that sum to be divided whereby &euro;65 million is for new services and &euro;20 million is for existing services.  By 2024, which is not far away, we want 10% of the overall health budget to be allocated towards mental health.  At the moment the spend is between 5% and 6% but the World Health Organization recommends that it should be 12% of the overall health budget.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the overall mental health services, we need a comprehensive community-based approach that ranges from prevention to treatment and recovery.  I refer to the relationship between State-run and HSE-run clinical services, alongside community-based organisations and projects that are either directly involved in mental health work, or indirectly, and by their very existence and nature they support the mental health of people so I am thinking of community-based initiatives.  I am sure that people here will be familiar with the impact that addiction has on families.  There are very good examples of family support networks that really need funding and, by extension, they help the mental health of people and families who are impacted by addiction and, similarly, in the area of homelessness, etc.  I could list a whole stream of initiatives but they are all involved in some way or other with mental health services.  It is hugely important and really good to see within the mental health strategy, other strategies and the legislation from Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, that everything is underpinned by human rights and the right of somebody to have access to good, free healthcare  ideally, and a safe place to live.  All of these things are intersectional and interconnected but lead to better mental health for the community and overall.  That is the wishlist sought by the Samaritans.  We are not unique in that ask and it is not rocket science.  These asks have existed for quite a long time and one can verify that by asking anybody who has worked in this area of work for a long time.  We feel like we are repeating ourselves but these supports are key and Ireland can do it.  I hope that the wishlist is okay.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Mulligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>We conducted a trial with transition year students in a second-level school in Waterford.

All the training is done in-house and is fantastic.<\/p> <p>  When I joined 11 years ago I would have considered myself as a fixer in life but we, in the Samaritans, do not give advice, which is an approach that must be knocked out of everybody.  It is a great life skill to learn because when a friend asks for advice then no matter one says, whether it is right or wrong, one is doing the wrong thing.  We are trained to reflect that question back to callers and say, \"What do you think you should do?\" thus helping them to tease out any issues.<\/p> <p>  A branch director is appointed for three years and he or she runs the branch.  Of our 13 branch directors over half of them have a full-time day job so they give a huge amount.  I have great admiration for them because they give another 14 or 15 hours a week to the organisation, at a minimum.  The branch directors have a leadership team around them to manage different aspects.  Running a branch is like a little business because there is finance and a building to manage as well as volunteers.  This is very challenging because each volunteer commits to doing three hours of duty a week and a six-hour overnight every five or six weeks.  It does not always happen that people will do what they are supposed to do.  It is not like in the workplace where one can threaten somebody because they rely on their salary but one must work with volunteers.  It is very challenging but we have great people.  I have great admiration for the volunteers, particularly through Covid because we all went through the same things as everybody else, we all struggled because things were taken away from us, yet we still had to listen to people who were struggling as well.  I cannot praise our volunteers highly enough.  Some volunteers, outside of the branch director, have day jobs.  Some volunteers are housewives, retirees or unemployed.  We have all strata of society as volunteers but what they give to their fellow humans is phenomenal.     <\/p> <p>  I thank Mr. Mulligan and his team.  We have ten or 11 fantastic staff.  Ms Stack will take calls at the weekend and at nighttime.  Technically, her hours are supposed to be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. as are Mr. Mulligan's but the hours that they put in show their commitment to the organisation.  I am very proud of what they do for us as well. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Fitzgerald"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I want to discuss the asks with Mr. Mulligan and I totally hear what he said.

If it becomes necessary to move our fundraising from being community based, on the street and at church gates, to a more online-focused model, then there will be a cost to doing that.  That is the first aspect and it affects all our branches in Ireland.  It is not only an issue in the Republic of Ireland, but it specifically affects our branches here.<\/p><p> Several questions were posed about evidence-based research and data.  It is crucial to ensure that what we are doing is backed up by evidence and by research.  Again, that is an area of work for us.  We have been involved in research involving men&rsquo;s health and men&rsquo;s mental health, for example.  It is important that we really know what the key issues are in Ireland and we want to expand our endeavours in this area.  That brings me to the question of how accessible we are and web chat.  Our phone line is accessible to the public, but there are people who are less able to access it.  That could be because of language, hearing or ability barriers.  We must examine that issue.  There are 18 key priority groups identified within Connecting for Life.  We must ask ourselves if our service is accessible to all of them, and if it is not, then we must determine what we can do to ensure that our service is accessible to as many people as possible.  We do not have a particular financial request to undertake that work, but it is something that we want to do which will ultimately cost money.

We also work with other organisations at a lower level with peer-to-peer training.  We trained many people in organisations where calls suddenly started coming in.  They might have a different type of helpline, but the calls that they were getting suddenly became crisis calls.  The staff and volunteers of those organisations would not necessarily know how to deal with crisis calls and those where suicidal ideation was being expressed.  We were able to train those volunteers in how to handle those types of calls and how to mind themselves and each other after dealing with those calls.  The Samaritans is almost like an expert guide in this area for other organisations.<\/p> <p>  We also found that many other organisations have had to go from offering face-to-face support to providing such support via telephone or online.  Those organisations would not normally have done that before.  We were able to go in and give expert advice on data protection, safeguarding and even on the technical side of how to manage a bigger phone line.  All the calls that we receive come into our freefone 116 123.  Calls from many different organisations come through to that number, though, including from charities.  We take calls from Alone after hours, and we also do that for five other organisations.  In addition, we also take calls through the Department of Foreign Affairs and offer support overseas in that context.  Therefore, we manage a large phone network and we have experience in this area.  We got support for that overseas phone line from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We go into partnerships, then, with statutory and other organisations.  The volunteers give their time for free and that would be a staff cost somewhere else.  We would be lost without the volunteers, as Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Mulligan said.  We would not be here if they had not been picking up the phone over the last 18 months and the previous 60 years as well.

I was watching the earlier proceedings and I noted down a few points.  I like the report submitted to us from the Samaritans and the presentation was interesting from several perspectives.  I am not judging, but, as Ms Stack was just saying, the Samaritans organisation brings a certain amount of expertise to the partnerships into which it enters compared to many other organisations.  The Samaritans deals with serious partners and I suspect that a<i>quid pro quo <\/i>is expected from those partner organisations to allow the Samaritans to follow through in its services.  I was not aware of the contact with the Diaspora, for example, and I am interested in that aspect.  What better partner could there be in that regard than the Department of Foreign Affairs and how they approach things?  I refer to the Department ensuring that things are done professionally and I imagine that it would not take on something like this in haste.  It would be a well thought through undertaking.<\/p><p>In addition, while some organisations come and go, the Samaritans have been with us for 60 years.  I did not realise it was quite that long.  It is, therefore, an enduring organisation.  It is still rather unsung and quiet, which I guess is the way the organisation likes it.  I was intrigued about the mental health of those working with the Samaritans, but Mr. Fitzgerald addressed that issue.  I was also interested in another point raised.  I do not know if this is a particularly Western thing, but when people ask if we might be free for a chat there is a tendency to automatically assume that advice and solutions are being sought.  I practised as a psychotherapist and active listening is something that we could all learn.  It can actually be a terrible burden when you think someone is coming to you for advice and looking for a solution as opposed to them just looking for an ear to listen.  That can be so therapeutic in itself, without the listener saying anything and perhaps just nodding his or her head.  The most significant aspect in this regard is knowing that the person on the other side of the phone line, or the web chat in this case, has the skills, training and ability - and if they are really good, it will not be possible to even know it - to contain whatever issues are raised. <\/p><p>It was also mentioned that we were fighting for years and still are fighting against the stigma around depression.  As a society, however, I think we are slowly coming to terms with articulating such experiences in a much better way than we did some decades ago.  Another important issue is loneliness.  Someone who used to be a colleague of ours, former Senator Keith Swanwick, undertook a good body of work on the subject of loneliness during the last Seanad.  He is also a GP.  Feedback would be welcome from the Samaritans in respect of what the organisation thinks it might be possible for us to do about loneliness.<\/p><p>The Chair asked what we could do to help the Samaritans.  Curiously, the organisation does not have significant requests to make of us.  That is a tribute to how contained the Samaritans is as an organisation.  One aspect is resources, but the witnesses did not come in here to scream about resources.  They came in to tell their story and the story of their organisation during Covid-19.  I was intrigued by the technology aspect as well.  It is vital.  I was very taken with the overall presentation, the booklet and the comments.  The Chair asked the witnesses what they need, but they do not have a great many needs.  My question then is why have the witnesses come before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#F00600","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":580,"content":"<p>We will not say no to money.

We may need some support in that regard.  What that support may involve I do not know.  I suppose we are here to tell our story.  While Mr. Mulligan said that people are aware of us, at the same time some people hear the word &ldquo;Samaritans&rdquo; and ask if we are a homeless charity or something like that.  They might not know exactly what it is that we do.  Therefore, we constantly want to get our message out there because our story is not a sexy one which will get onto all the high-profile programmes.  It is an important story, though, and one that we must make everyone aware of.<\/p> <p>  Funnily enough, I did an interview on one of the radio channels during the year and afterwards a friend of mine, an intelligent man, said that was the first time that he knew what we did.  While our telephone number is flashed up on every programme when there is a crisis or whatever, we still need to get our message out there and to get the right people to ring us.  Again, there are cohorts of people, such as middle-aged men and young people in college, who may be struggling.  We must get our message out that we are there for them when nobody else is, through the night or whatever the case may be.<\/p><p>That is important.  On the issue of loneliness, I do not know the solution.  There are 400,000 people in Ireland living alone.  An awful lot of people living with somebody are still lonely.  One does not have to be living alone to be lonely.  As the saying goes, you can be in a crowded room and still be lonely.  As mentioned by Ms Stack, we get an awful lot of calls early in the morning from people just wanting to hear a voice, who probably will not hear another voice all day.  It is a societal issue as to how that can be supported in local communities and activities.  The people who are struggling will probably not go to an activity.  I do not know how we can help them other than to be there to at least give them another voice and to support them through the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rory Fitzgerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question as to the reason we are here is a very good one.  We are here because we launched our impact report two weeks ago, which we circulated.  On the question, first, we are very proud of what we do.  Second, the Deputy is correct that the Samaritans as an organisation is not out all the time blowing its own trumpet.  In the morning, if the Samaritans no longer existed what would be the impact of that on the mental health of society?  I think it would be immense.  It is beholden on us to, at times, engage openly about what we do and to ensure that people, policymakers and politicians are aware of the importance of the organisation.  The 2,000 volunteers behind us go about their work quietly.  They answer the telephone calls and they listen.  That is crucial.  If they were not doing that, the impact that would have on individual mental health would be immense.  We are here to take the opportunity to talk about our work.  We like to do that.  We have some key messages and some key asks, which are not necessarily Samaritans asks but are key asks, because we are part of that wider collective of organisations that work within the area of mental health.  We have our own needs, but there is a much wider picture.  If we can contribute to that then hopefully in ten years, 10% of the health spend will be on mental health and people will have greater access to services.  There are recommendations around free counselling services.  If that exists in five or ten years, we will have contributed to that in some way.

Last year, just before Covid hit we managed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Dublin Samaritans.  One of the volunteers there on the night has been involved in that branch since it opened.  The volunteers are humble about what they do.  They do not brag even though what they do can save a life every day.  It is incredible.  Next month, the Belfast branch will celebrate 60 years in operation.  Again, that is an incredible achievement.  That branch was open throughout the Troubles.  Its doors never closed.<\/p> <p>  The work of a volunteer is active listening.  We are constantly trying to promote active listening on social media and on our website through the SHUSH programme.  It is all about how to start a conversation and how to listen.  To do that people have to put away the mobile phone and, perhaps, turn off the television and then turn to the other person and ask how he or she is feeling.  It is important to allow the person to answer and to not jump in at that point and talk about what happened to you, as we all love to do.  It is about active listening and being there for each other.  Free counselling services would make a huge difference in society.  Active listening would breakdown the stigma because if there are people within our circle or work colleagues who are struggling to cope we will have a bit more time for other people around us who are struggling to cope as well.  <\/p> <p>  The task force on loneliness is up and running again and looking at what can be done.  It is a huge issue that cannot be resolved by one organisation or one solution.  For example, it covers the teenager who barely attended school in the past two and a half years because of Covid and is suddenly forced back into a school but cannot mix with his or her friends in other classes right up to the elderly person who might be at home alone every day.  As I said it is a huge issue, which will require a great deal of work over a number of years to break it down. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Stack"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":586,"content":"<p>Politics is a much maligned profession.  It is the thing to do to knock the body yet there is not a politician in Leinster House who does not get up to half a dozen, and more, telephone calls to their offices from the same people every week or month.  These people rarely have a query but they will manufacture one purely just to engage with someone.  When house calls were permitted, a politician might often have been the only person to have called, reached out to or dropped a note to a particular household.  We have a role to play there.  We are familiar with that territory.  I say that because our voice tends to get lost in this regard for some reason these days.  The public have an awful lot of time on a one-to-one basis and they have positive things to say about their politicians but there is a general view that we do not bring any positivity to the table.  As I said, we, and our staff, are familiar with that space of the common callers who, probably, do not have other people to reach out to.  We are very happy to take those calls and to give time to them.<\/p> <p>  On the social media piece, as we know, in the past 24 hours Twitter had a field day.  As everybody moved to Twitter a number of funny things happened.  My question as to the reason the Samaritans is here today was rhetorical but slightly provocative.  I am glad the witnesses are here.  They are welcome to avail of the opportunity to do so once a year but they should not be afraid to reach out directly to individual politicians when it comes to the need for funding.  Either they do or do not need funding.  They should not hide their light under a bushel.  What I have learned in politics, which I do not like, is that those who shout loudest are often the ones who are heard.  Those who do the work quietly and diligently are easy to overlook because they do not create a fuss.  I am not saying that the Samaritans should become an organisation that creates fuss, but it can create little fusses.  It can create 160 fusses with individual Deputies in different constituencies.  It can also create them with Senators.  It does not have to be a big drama.  <\/p> <p>  The contribution today was very good.  It woke me up to the Samaritans, the role it plays and the work it did during Covid.  The longevity of the organisation is testimony to its efficacy, because most organisations do not last that long.  There are others who shout loud.  There is something admirable about an organisation that goes about its work quietly, but in a world that is full of noise, it is important to make sure it is heard.  We are here to help.

Some people will struggle who did not struggle in the past.  Some people are struggling to go back out into social situations because of fear.  In terms of how that can be resolved, we have to help those people.  We certainly get calls around those issues from people.  All the things that happen, such as loneliness, isolation, anxiety, and depression, were magnified throughout Covid-19, and there is probably a fall-out to come from that, which we would be concerned about.<\/p> <p>  There are also people whose businesses are not going to survive or whose jobs are going to be lost.

Other issues that have come up during the pandemic are an obvious increase in domestic violence and the impact that will have, and addiction, in particular alcohol use.  How many people's alcohol intake has increased over the past 18 months?  What will be the long-term impact of that on those individuals?  We will probably only see that beginning to emerge over the next 18 months or two years, although we do not know for definite.<\/p> <p>  These are some of the things the Samaritans, as an organisation, is concerned about.

The witnesses mentioned that they are extremely busy from 6 p.m. until 10 p.m.  Although they run a 24-hour service, these are the busiest hours.  They also take calls through other helplines - in other words, they offer their number to other groups, so that people may contact them after other groups' 6 p.m. finish time.  I would be interested to hear a little more about that.  They mentioned 2,000 volunteers but Covid-19 caused a reduction in the numbers they were able to access.  Is there anything we can do to help to support them in terms of a recruitment campaign or people becoming involved as volunteers?  One of my key questions is on how we support them going forward.  <\/p> <p>  I liked what the witnesses said about providing a service for people abroad.  That was a wonderful thing to do, particularly when so many Irish people - the diaspora abroad - who have family in Ireland were not able to return home and may have been going through very difficult times, being isolated abroad and feeling very far from home.<\/p><p>At least for many of us here, even though we were isolated on our own, we knew we were very close to loved ones, which meant a lot.<\/p><p> With regard to rural areas, I am representing Roscommon and Galway, which is very much a rural regional area.  The witnesses spoke about being able to deliver online engagement and how important that was.  I always presumed it was over the phone.  Do the Samaritans offer face-to-face online services or was that more for webinar and training sessions for its volunteers and staff?<\/p><p> Those are my queries.  I thank the witnesses.  Through the HSE and everything else, our main question is how we can look to support the Samaritans, even in terms of recruitment and campaigns for volunteers.  I am very interested in that.  Go raibh mile maith agaibh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#H01100","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>The support with other organisations has been ongoing since about 2012.  They have different opening hours so one of them might close at 8 p.m. and if a person rings that helpline, they will get a message that the phone line is closed but if the person stays on the line, they can go through to the Samaritans.  The caller has the option to hang up at that stage or they can come through to the 116 line.  It is a safeguard for people.  It is a successful service that we offer.  Last year, we took nearly 1,400 calls through six different organisations, and that was listening for over 300 hours.  Therefore, it is needed out there.  Many people will want a specific helpline and will hang up and call the next day, but if they are in distress at that time, and it could be the middle of the night, some of the helplines are open overnight and we can be there during the day, so that is when we step in.  The volunteers take those calls like they take any call from any organisation or any caller around the country.  This is renewed quite often with many of the organisations, which can see the benefit of it, as we see the benefit of it.  We are just there to support people when they need us.<\/p> <p>  On the partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs, a memorandum of understanding was set up, although it took a while to set that up for technical reasons.  We have these phone lines coming in from six different countries, so it took a while for it to be set up and for them to come in.  They are advertised in the original country through the embassy staff.  The Department of Foreign Affairs came to us because people were arriving in crisis at the embassies or were contacting local consular staff.  While they were more than able to help and support them with legal issues, travel issues or anything like that, when people showed up in crisis, the staff wanted this extra backup.  Our phone number is promoted in certain countries through embassies, the local GAA, Irish business groups and some magazines, and we have had pieces in local magazines for Irish people overseas.  From all of that, I know that, last year, we took 61 dialogue calls and we were on the phone for over nine hours and, this year, there were 25 dialogue calls in the first six months of the year, supporting for over seven hours.  We are not there for anyone who just fancies a chat with someone back home; it really is for people who are in crisis overseas.  It was extended this year to other countries where people were actually being restricted in regard to travel and that was impacting on them.  Again, they get the very same service if they pick up the phone to the Samaritans in Galway or in Sydney.  The Department of Foreign Affairs phone lines are funded on the Department&rsquo;s side.<\/p> <p>  A nice outcome from this is that we are also the official mental health partner of the GAA.  Through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the GAA, we presented some mental health and well-being webinars to GAA members in Germany and in the Middle East, and that has been well received by people over there.  It is just an addition that a staff member has done.<\/p> <p>  On training, the volunteers train themselves in the branches.  Volunteer training and ongoing training in the branches stayed in the branches and that was done online by them.  In terms of external training, we would always have been able to train face-to-face with groups.  If it was staff at a homeless agency who were suddenly getting very distressing calls, by being able to put it online, we were able to go a bit further with that.  It is about training staff and volunteers in organisations who may be dealing with the unemployed, with the homeless and with people in addiction services.  During Covid, the homelessness and addiction issues suddenly became very much crisis calls, and we were able to extend our services in that way.  It is something we will continue to do because it has been very well received on both sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Stack"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>Would anyone else like to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32021100500002#J00300","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>On the question of how the committee can help, I would ask the Senator and all her colleagues in politics to make people aware, within their local communities, of who we are and to encourage people to join us as volunteers.

My name is Eamonn Kelly and I am a principal officer in the EU and international planning regulation section in the planning division of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am joined today by colleagues from my section - Mary Brady, assistant principal, and Aisling Holohan, administrative officer, who are also connecting remotely to this session.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendments, as set out in the general scheme, concern the substitute consent regime at Part XA of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  This part of the Act relates to the procedures for applications to regularise, where appropriate, existing development requiring retrospective environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, AA. <\/p> <p>  The objective of the general scheme for the 2021 Bill is essentially to streamline the substitute consent procedure in the planning system.  Streamlining of the substitute consent regime is required to increase the efficiency and utility of the process in order to safeguard confidence in the Irish planning system by eliminating a surplus step in the substitute consent process and moreover to ensure that the system is fully in compliance with EU environmental requirements and recent court judgments.  In this context, it is proposed to provide for a single-stage application process under the remit of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This would replace the current two-stage process, which requires leave from the board or a direction from a planning authority in order to apply for substitute consent and follows with the substantive substitute consent application.  It is also proposed to amend section 37L of the Planning Act.  This is a related amendment that currently allows simultaneous applications to be made for certain quarry developments for both future development and substitute consent to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the same.  The amendments we are proposing will ensure that simultaneous applications will be open to all types of development, not just quarries.  Finally, amendments are also proposed to section 34(12) of the Planning Act to require planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to screen an application or an appeal for retention permission for EIA and AA as appropriate and to refuse to consider applications for retention of unauthorised development where either an EIA or AA was or is required for such development. <\/p> <p>  These amendments supplement the amendments introduced in December 2020 under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020.  The December 2020 amendments obliged An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider whether exceptional circumstances exist at the substantive substitute consent application stage in order to justify a grant of substitute consent, which ensures that this consideration of exceptional circumstances is subject to full public participation at the substantive application stage.  Prior to the December 2020 legislation, exceptional circumstances had only been considered at the initial application for leave stage, which stage does not provide for public participation.<\/p> <p>  I will provide the background to the substitute consent process generally.  The European Union&rsquo;s EIA directive requires that projects likely to have significant environmental effects must undergo an EIA before development consent is given.  In 2008, the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, in case C-215\/06 found that Ireland's planning provisions that facilitated retention permission applications for existing developments where such developments also required an EIA was contrary to EU law.  Accordingly, section 34(12) of the Planning Act was amended in 2011 so that planning authorities cannot accept applications for retention of unauthorised development where, had an application been made before development had commenced, it would have required an EIA, an EIA screening determination or an AA.  Rather, such applications would go into the substitute consent process instead.  <\/p> <p>  The CJEU judgment at the same time did recognise that EU law does not preclude regularisation of unauthorised EIA developments in exceptional circumstances provided that this does not facilitate the circumvention or evasion of EU environmental obligations.  In this context, the \"substitute consent\" facility under Part XA of the Planning Act was introduced and became effective in September 2011. <\/p> <p>  Substitute consent procedures under Part XA of the Act allow for the regularisation and the undertaking of retrospective EIA or AA of development that has already been carried out.  Substitute consent applications are determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for existing developments that required an EIA, EIA screening or an AA but where such assessments were not carried out. <\/p> <p>  In deciding \"exceptional circumstances\", the board must consider a number of matters prescribed at section 177D(2) of the Planning Act, including whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the EIA directive or the habitats directive and whether the applicant could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised.  <\/p> <p>  There is currently no entitlement to make an application for substitute consent directly to the board.  Rather, and as mentioned earlier, substitute consent is generally a two-stage process requiring either a direction issued by a planning authority or grant of leave by the board to apply to the board for substitute consent.  Once that leave is granted, it is followed by the making of a substantive application for substitute consent to the board as the second stage.  Generally, the first stage is the leave stage while the second stage is the actual substantive application.  Both are made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  <\/p> <p>  I will now move to the 2020 amendments to substitute consent process, which arose from a Supreme Court judgment.  The Supreme Court judgment of 1 July 2020 in the Ballysax\/McQuaid judicial review cases found that certain provisions of the substitute consent system were inconsistent with the EIA directive in terms of the lack of an exceptionality criteria in the \"defective permission\" ground for leave under sections 177C(2)(a) and 177D(1)(a) of the Act.  The lack of public participation at the leave stage generally was found to be inconsistent with the EIA directive.  \"Exceptionality circumstances\" were considered at that time as part of leave application stage under sections 177D(1) and 177D(2), which did not provide for public participation and which was not revisited at the later application stage, which did provide for public participation.<\/p><p>As a consequence of that, Part XA of the Act was amended by emergency legislation that was effective from 19 December 2020, namely, the Planning and Development (Amendment) and Residential Tenancies Act 2020, to immediately address the terms of the Supreme Court judgment.  The amendments mean that the board must now be satisfied in the second stage substantive application for substitute consent that exceptional circumstances exist in order to justify a grant of substitute consent.  Since the legislation was commenced in December 2020, the consideration of exceptional circumstances has been, therefore, subject to full public participation as it is considered at the substantive stage.  In other words, the consideration of exceptionality takes place at the second stage, when members of the public have an opportunity to comment.<\/p><p> The 2020 Act amendments also contained transitional provisions that required an additional round of public consultation in cases where an application for substitute consent was pending before the Board at the time the 2020 Act was commenced.  This transitional provision aimed to ensure that second stage applications for substitute consent that had already been submitted but not decided by the board were subject to the consideration of exceptional circumstances in order to give the developer the opportunity to provide any further information on exceptionality and, importantly, to facilitate the public and interested bodies making further submissions on exceptionality in the substitute consent application stage, including specifically on whether exceptional circumstances existed or not.<\/p><p> However, notwithstanding the 2020 amendments which addressed the terms of the July 2020 Supreme Court judgment, the substitute consent process itself now contains an initial stage, the application for leave stage, which is effectively surplus and does not provide for public participation.  The amendments before the committee seek to streamline the substitute consent process in order to remove this surplus step, thereby making the process easier to understand for the public and participants alike.<\/p><p> The main provisions of the general scheme are as follows.  The first two heads are standard heads that will be converted into sections in the Act and relate to the Short Title, citations and definitions in the Bill.  Head 3 sets out amendments to section 34(12) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which currently precludes planning authorities from accepting a retention application for existing unauthorised development in cases where, had a planning application been made before it commenced, an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or an EIA determination or an appropriate assessment, AA, would have been required in respect of that application.  The proposed amendments at this provision will also apply this provision to the board.  Effectively, on legal advice we are correcting an issue that was spotted in the legislation.  The proposed amendments will also apply these provisions to the board in the case of any appeal and will require planning authorities and the board to also consider whether an EIA and an AA was or is required for the development and to delete section 34(12)(b) in order to allow for planning authorities and the board to carry out a screening for EIA to determine whether a retention application can be accepted.  In other words, the advice we received was that the provision in question contained an anomaly such that not only if the particular development required an EIA, but even if it required screening for an EIA, i might be obliged to go for substitute consent.  We have clarified that.  Rather than having an anomaly whereby it might go to substitute consent before any screening is carried out, we are now obliging the local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to carry out the screening to see whether an EIA or an AA is required.<\/p><p> Head 4 proposes to amend section 37L of the planning Act, which provides for simultaneous applications for future development for certain quarries at the same time as substitute consent applications.  Currently, only certain quarries defined in the planning Act under section 261A can avail of simultaneous applications which are limited to future quarrying.  It is proposed to extend the facility for simultaneous applications for future planning applications to any development being determined as part of a substitute consent application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Prospective planning applications will not be decided by the board until the related substitute consent application has been decided.<\/p><p> Heads 5 to 18 propose related amendments to Part XA of the Act to streamline substitute consent procedures.  Most of these involve the deletion of references to the first stage.  At present, there is no entitlement to make an application directly to the board for substitute consent.  Substitute consent is a two-stage process requiring either a direction to apply to the board issued by a planning authority or a grant by the board for leave to apply for substitute consent, followed by the making of a substantive application for substitute consent to the board.  Heads 5 to 18 instead provide for a single-stage application process for all development types, which will allow a person to apply directly for substitute consent under section 177E of the Act, thereby obviating the need for an initial first stage application for leave to apply for substitute consent or otherwise.  In this context, it should be borne in mind that the initial first stage did not provide for public participation.<\/p><p> These amendments include the repeal of sections 177B, 177C and 177D of the planning Act to facilitate the single-stage process, under which a direction from a planning authority under Section 177B or leave from the board under Section 177D to apply for substitute consent is no longer required.  All matters, including the question of exceptional circumstances, are considered as part of the single-stage substantive application process under section 177K.  A defect in a planning permission, such as an error of law, will remain a valid consideration for the purposes of assessment of exceptional circumstances under section 177K, the criteria of which have been copied from the repealed section 177D.<\/p><p> It is proposed to amend section 177E to allow pre-application consultations with the board on proposed substitute consent applications and to enable any person who has carried out development to apply to the board for substitute consent in respect of development carried out where an EIA or an AA or both was or is required and where that person considers exceptional circumstances exist.  Section 177E will also be amended to require that either or both a remedial EIA report or a remedial natura impact statement must accompany an application for substitute consent.  That includes a natura impact statement or an environmental impact assessment report in respect of any permitted development not yet carried out.<\/p><p> Finally, it is proposed to amend section 177K to restate the exceptionality criteria at this section following the repeal of section 177D.  As explained previously, the emergency 2020 amendments to the substitute consent process already require the board to be satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist in order to justify a grant of substitute consent. The exceptional criteria that the board must consider are being moved from section 177D into the substantive application stage at section 177K(1J) accordingly.  Other amendments as set out in the scheme are consequential to the repeal of sections 177B and 177C.<\/p><p> I again thank the Chairman and members for facilitating this briefing.

This morning in private session the committee completed the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the large-scale residential developments Bill.  That Bill seeks to rebalance what many believe to be an error in the strategic housing development, SHD, legislation, that is, the removal of the community voice and, second, the idea that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be the first decision maker in the process.  Given that background and position, I certainly welcome the additional public consultation.  It is very important, particularly as it relates to exceptional circumstances.  My fear is that as An Bord Plean&aacute;la is now the decision maker at first point, two concerns arise.  When that happened under SHD legislation, there was not enough consultation or adherence to city development plans.  The second concern relates to the cumulative impact of similar developments.  Many local authorities are quite good at spotting a trend relating to several applications coming in and the cumulative impact that may have on an area.  My fear is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la may not have the same local knowledge or the desire to spot and monitor the impact of those cumulative developments.  My worry is that in the context of this process, which I accept is much less common, An Bord Plean&aacute;la would not have the local focus that local authorities have but it is the first decision maker in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#B00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McAuliffe for the question.  The first point is that this is not a change or the introduction of something new.  Applications for substitute consent have always gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is important because of what the Deputy mentioned in that they are very rare.  Looking over the records there was a glut of maybe 30 or 40 substitute consent applications when the legislation was originally introduced back in 2012 and 2013 and they were mostly related to quarries.  The vast majority of these relate to quarries.  Many of those were time-bound.  There are very few now and we are talking about four or five per year that might get through.  They are spread all over the country.  They are very technical and often subject to very detailed environmental considerations.<\/p> <p>  As it stands, we have a concentration of expertise in An Bord Plean&aacute;la in this respect.  This is not the same as strategic infrastructure development or something that is going to happen much.  Let us say these are problematic developments that might have historical issues of which the local authority would be aware.  The local authority would be fully involved in the substitute consent process and given ten weeks to make submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on that.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be fully apprised of any concerns that a local authority might have.<\/p> <p>  We are considering leaving it with An Bord Plean&aacute;la because it is so rare and unusual and it would be a drain on the resources of local authorities.  These concern environmentally sensitive matters.  There are county councils from Leitrim to Roscommon to Galway involved with this.  It is spread all over the country.  We are not talking about a concentration of residential developments that might happen with strategic housing developments in cities, for example.  As colleagues from my Department have acknowledged, amendments will be made to give points to local authorities for elements to be zoned.<\/p> <p>  In many of these cases there is no zoning.  It may be in open and rural countryside for agricultural buildings, wind farms and quarries.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question but it is a matter of efficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":626,"content":"<p>It certainly does and I appreciate the answer.

It is basically about the same considerations.  Effectively, as it currently stands, one must apply for substitute consent to regularise the environmental impact assessment issues that have gone before.  It is relevant if the party wants to continue doing something else on the site.  For example, if the unauthorised development on a quarry site is to be solved, a planning application would be required to go forward.  A substitute consent is not the same as a planning application.  There is a concentration of expertise in An Bord Plean&aacute;la that would assess it.  We can assume the development has been regularised, as the point is moot otherwise.  If the party wanted to continue with the same activity, a related activity or something else on the same site, it would have to go to the local authority.  This relates to the loss of expertise that the board would have.  This provision allows both processes to take place at the same time.  It would be up to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but as it does in some cases, the board could apply the same inspectors to the same application.  The board could hold oral hearings at the same time.<\/p> <p>  Effectively, this is an efficiency and it would allow members of the public to engage at a single point in time.  This is instead of a party having to apply to the board first and then at some future point having to apply to the local authority, which would effectively have to do the process all over again, relying on the same baseline data.  This is not a SHD issue but it relates to very technical environmental matters.  If I could summarise with one word, it is about efficiencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I appreciate those answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#C00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  One of the problems with that presentation is the impression that this is a very light and technical matter.  We use words like \"efficiency\" and \"regularise\" but it is really important to remember we are talking about unauthorised developments.  In some cases we are talking about unauthorised developments that have had and continue to have very profound negative effects on communities, the local environment, water courses, biodiversity etc.  Even the term \"unauthorised development\" is probably too light, as these are illegal developments.  This is about what we do to try to address those illegal developments.<\/p> <p>  I am using this language because most ordinary people watching outside might think what we are discussing to this point is relatively remarkable or it is a technical exercise to get ourselves over some legal hitches.  In fact, next week will mark the 18th anniversary of the Derrybrien mudslide, which is probably the most egregious example of where our planning system chronically failed an entire community and surrounding areas.  It is a failure that not only caused considerable legal and legislative problems but has caused considerable fines for the Exchequer.  It is really important people understand what we are talking about and we get this right.  I am less concerned about whether something is a one-stage or a two-stage process because it is really about getting the process right so we do not have a repeat of the kind of mistakes we have had in the past.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of general opening questions, and in the second, third and possibly fourth round I will hit the witness with the more technical and troublesome questions, if that is okay.  Who was consulted by the Department and officials in the drafting of this general scheme?  Has there been any consultation with third parties, interested parties or other experts?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the witness saying there are only four or five substitute consents per year; the issue is not so much their number but their size.  One Derrybrien in a year equates to a pretty bad set of circumstances so will the witness give a sense of the scale of some of the substitute consent cases and the kind of environmental impacts and challenges of those?  Will he provide an update on the fines?  When we discussed these matters last year, the workings of the EU fines for Derrybrien was approximately &euro;20 million, so has that increased or has the process ceased?  Are there other areas where the State and the taxpayer is being fined for these kinds of environmental planning failures?<\/p> <p>  I have a question around exceptional circumstances, as this is a concept with which many of us had real difficulty when we dealt with the legislation last year.  As is often the case with such matters, it was rushed in that case.  Will the witness explain in plain English what are exceptional circumstances?  It seems from my limited knowledge of the area that exceptional circumstances are not necessarily that exceptional at all.  For the second and third round of questions, I have very specific questions on the heads and will return on those if the time allows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#C00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Without a doubt, these measures relate to very serious and significant projects in the context of potential damage to the environment.  It is worth noting we are not amending significant provisions that are already in the substitute consent process; these are amendments to an existing regime that is very unusual.  It is not like a normal planning application.  When An Bord Plean&aacute;la addresses the applications, in advance of even making its decision it has the power to instruct the developer to cease activities being carried out on the site.  Through the process the board can refuse permission, and it can also request remediation.  Perhaps one of the key phrases to grasp is that this is a process to regularise unauthorised development and it allows for remediation.  It is very important that it allows public input into what are, in many cases, illegal or unauthorised developments, as the Deputy has said.  It is important to note that.  Perhaps I was remiss in not referring to what is already in the system.  The provisions already exist and we are not changing them.

They are the parties we have consulted thus far.  I will add that we have had engagement, specifically, with representatives of the Green Party.  The key point is that we are before the committee now to take any views members might have on it.  We are always happy to hear any suggestions.<\/p><p> On fines, Derrybrien is still ongoing.  At this stage, the State has paid a little more than &euro;10 million.  As far as I am aware, that case has to do with the regularisation of an ESB wind farm in Derrybrien.  That is currently working its way through the substitute consent process at the moment.  No doubt, there will be more payments on that.  Every six months, the State is liable to pay &euro;2.745 million.  There will definitely be more fines on that basis.  To respond to Deputy Ring's question, we have paid &euro;10 million thus far.  <\/p><p> We have gone through some examples of substitute consent.  Effectively, when the legislation was first enacted, the vast majority of the cases related to quarries.  It is very varied at the moment.  We have examples.  Peat harvesting has come through as one in the past year and there has been a number of peat cases.  Bord na M&oacute;na, for example, put through seven or eight applications, but it subsequently withdrew them because, as members are probably aware, it is changing its policy on cutting peat.  There are other examples relating to grid connections.  There are applications for an oyster processing facility, a waste facility, an agricultural structure, road widening, a holiday home, a sea wall, a manufacturing plant, a harbour development and a glass recycling facility, to give Deputy &Oacute; Broin examples.  These are cases that are not necessarily large scale.  The appropriate assessment side of substitute consent, which is to do with protection of specific designated areas under the habitats directive and the birds directive, may bring cases in that are quite small but are still significant and need to be addressed.  In all cases, we are not talking about something as big or as significant as Derrybrien, but it is one of the most well-known cases.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

That is something that ties in significantly with our climate action goals and also with proper planning, which is effectively what we are trying to achieve.

I would certainly welcome the officials' views on why that is the best route to go down but, looking at it from the outside, it seems to make the most logistical sense.<\/p> <p>  I have one of these, possibly, controversial situations in my constituency.  One of the things that is a bit of a loophole that can often be exploited is if somebody is denied substitute consent and applies for a judicial review.

The local authority has an obligation and a duty to investigate.  If an enforcement case is ongoing, the difficulty is sometimes more to do with the courts.  It is a practical reality that there is no prohibition on enforcement continuing if a substitute consent case is ongoing.  As the Deputy alluded to, it is more the situation that if a judicial review is ongoing, and this may be very specific, a judge in an enforcement case might be hesitant to process or to proceed with enforcement if a separate judge is looking at the same case.  That is more of a legal matter.  The planning Act is clear.  If there is unauthorised development, and it is still within the time period - which is seven years for most developments but there is no time bar on prosecution for quarries and peat development - that holds true.  The Act is clear that enforcement must proceed if it has been commenced.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if that answers the question.  It is not necessarily something this amendment can specifically address because it is the case, as I said, that there is certainly no prohibition on enforcement being proceeded with under the planning Act, notwithstanding a substitute consent happening at the same time.  The Deputy gave an example of a judicial review.  Perhaps someone from the Attorney General's office or a barrister would be better placed to answer why or how that might be delayed in the courts.

On certain projects, once an enforcement notice has been given, there is a statutory time within which you have to reply to it.  If you reply to a statutory notice arising from an enforcement, once you open communications, it then goes to the local authority.  In cases where an enforcement is sent out and somebody is late replying within ten days or whatever, and if the paperwork is correct, is there something that can stop enforcement proceedings continuing?  We had a case in Limerick recently that went on for two and a half years over paperwork that was submitted on time, but was not registered on time.  We found it took two and a half years, with a lot of legal expenses, to correct a case.  After two and a half years, it was struck out due to the enforcement regulations that were in place at the time.<\/p> <p>  For anyone who is building outside the regulations, and enforcement proceedings have started and are ongoing, that is fine.  However, if it is the case that enforcement proceedings are put in place that are not warranted, is there a way of getting through this process and not delaying projects for a year or two years over something that was overlooked, or something that came in and was not addressed at the time?  Much of this is to do with staffing levels in local authorities.  The staffing is not there to meet the demands of enforcement, which means a lot of enforcement is not carried through on time.  It is causing issues, especially within the Limerick local authority where we have seen it.  Local authorities need more staff and more people to deal with enforcement but they also need to be able to follow it through.  In a case where paperwork is not in the right place on time, they also need to be able to stop the proceedings and to have an opt-out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#D00500","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":638,"content":"<p>This particular amendment does not address enforcement but substitute consent.

We are pulling two clunky procedures together into a more efficient procedure.  We are pulling the leave to apply stage and the substantial stage together.  I have a concern about the notification to third parties or members of the public who may be concerned.  They might have a shorter timeframe to become aware that a substitute consent case has been taken in order to participate in the process.  If somebody is seeking leave to apply, a member of the public will become aware of it and that would be his or her tip-off that a substitute consent process is developing.  He or she will then get the result and hear whether the project gets permission to proceed to the second stage and there is public participation in one of those phases, although I cannot remember which.

It would be rare for this situation to arise.  It is not something that we foresee anybody will be taking advantage of.

The Chairman, Deputy Matthews, had the same questions, or perhaps it was another Deputy.  Effectively, the exceptionality circumstance and the criteria that have to be considered were devised between the Government and the European Commission, with the input of the Attorney General, about ten years ago.  They have been through a number of court cases, including the significant challenge to the substitute consent process in the Supreme Court, and there were no specific challenges to the exceptionality criteria.  They remain as is.  To be brutally honest, we would be loath to change them.  We have any amount of legal advice to say that it fully complies.  I can go through them one by one, if the Deputy wishes, but they meet all those criteria.  To be absolutely clear, we are not going to change them.  We believe that they are robust, and they have been through a number of court cases.  We believe they meet the requirements - it was originally the Derrybrien case - as agreed with the Commission.  We do not want to change them because we think they comply.  We are also comfortable, as they have been through a number of court cases, including through the Supreme Court, and there were no queries, issues or grounds raised against those criteria.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy looks at section 177D(2), it provides that in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist the board shall, not may, have regard to the following matters: whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the purpose and objective of the EI directive, which the Deputy mentioned, and \"whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised\".  That goes to the intentions of the developer and that can be examined by the board as to whether there is an intent to avoid, and whether the developers had knowledge in advance that they were doing something wrong.  The third criterion is \"whether the ability to carry out an assessment of the environmental impacts of the development for the purpose of an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment and to provide for public participation in such an assessment has been substantially impaired\".  That is another thing to look at.  The fourth criterion is \"the actual or likely significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site resulting from the carrying out or continuation of the development\".  The fifth criterion is \"the extent to which significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site can be remediated\".  The sixth is \"whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development\".  If anything, that goes possibly even further than the EI directive because it very much relates to what actions the developer has carried out nearby or elsewhere.  The last criterion is \"such other matters as the Board considers relevant\" in that particular case.<\/p> <p>  We have received an amount of legal advice on this.  Given the fact that it has already been before the Supreme Court, we are as confident as we can be that it complies with the requirements of the Derrybrien judgment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":664,"content":"<p>We are in the third round now.

We owed &euro;10.5 million as of October last year and, as has been said, it is &euro;2.7 million or &euro;2.8 million every six months, so the total amount is &euro;16.1 million.  It would be good if that could be confirmed either at the meeting or afterwards because it is a considerable amount of money.  Also, my understanding is, and I am not asking anybody to comment on an ongoing legal case but it is important that we have clarity, that the fines will stop not when substitute consent is granted but when full remediation of the environmental and community damage is dealt with.  Perhaps it could be clarified if that is or is not the case.  My understanding is that there are no other comparable fines affected by substitute consent, but the witnesses could inform the committee whether that is correct.<\/p> <p>  On the one-stage process, I strongly concur with both the Chairman and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.  Five weeks is nowhere near enough.  On the one hand we are being told that this is like any other planning application, yet we were told earlier in the meeting that this is not like any other planning application.  The reason it is going to the board for substitute consent is that, in the words of Mr. Kelly, it requires \"detailed environmental considerations\".  If it is not like any other planning application because it needs such detailed environmental considerations, I do not see how five weeks can be adequate in any set of circumstances.  I appreciate that some of these are small developments but many, particularly the list that Mr. Kelly gave us earlier, are not small or insignificant.  I hope the committee makes a very strong recommendation to extend that period.  That is not to delay the process.  The better the level of public participation at the earlier stage, the better planning outcome there would be.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the exceptional circumstances.  Again, this is quite technical.  If one reads paragraph 57, which Deputy Cian O'Callaghan referred to, there are three explicit tests in it in terms of the consent not offering the \"persons concerned the opportunity to circumvent the Community rules or to dispense with applying them, and that it should remain the exception\".  I do not see from anything that has been said how that is captured in section 177D.  I am also particularly interested in section 177D(2)(g) \"such other matters as the Board considers relevant\".  Perhaps Mr. Kelly could tell us what types of matters could be captured by that and whether that has also been subject to the advice of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>  I will rattle out some questions with respect to some of the heads and if Mr. Kelly gets to answer them in this round or the following round, that would be great.  In head 1, there is no reference to the commencement of the provisions.  Is that normal or standard, and can he explain that?  With regard to head 3, it seems strange that there is no specification of the screening determination and the criteria.  That appears to be quite vague and ambiguous.  Given that Mr. Kelly only mentions appropriate assessments and the EIA directive, could there be other aspects of EU law or assessment requirements and why are they not mentioned?  Why is there not greater clarity about the basis upon which the screening determinations are being made?  I have another concern about the same head.  We obviously have a lack of Natura 2000 site designation.  That has a direct relevance in terms of the screening determinations that fall under this head.  How is the board to reconcile that with respect to the assessments?<\/p> <p>  I want to pick up on a point my two colleagues mentioned.  I am very concerned that somebody who could have an application for substitute consent for an unauthorised, illegal and potentially environmentally damaging development could also now get access to a fast-track, forward-facing planning application.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Substitute consent should be dealt with as substitute consent.  If remediation is required through a remediation order, that should be provided.  Only when all of that is resolved if somebody then wishes to expand the operation through a fresh application, the person should have to go through the normal course.  I do not see why somebody who is clearly breaking the rules should be rewarded for that by giving the person access to a one-stage planning process, when many of those issues would be better dealt with by the local authorities in the first instance and then by way of appeal to the board.<\/p><p>Can Mr. Kelly explain the rationale for giving people access to what is essentially a fast-track planning process for future planning applications, separate to the substitute consent consideration and talk us through a few concrete examples?  That would be very helpful.<\/p><p> One of the real issues in head 5, and one which speaks to Deputy O'Callaghan's concerns, is that where there are potential or clear conflicts between EU law and requirements and domestic law and practice, it seems we may be taking the side of domestic law, which could get us into further difficulties down the line with further EU legal challenges.  With regard to head 6, as is always the case with these things, enforcement is key.  Looking at Derrybrien, which is the longest-standing and most egregious case in this process, I do not see many signs of remediation and enforcement to the required extent.  If that is the case and of course, we are being fined as a consequence, is Mr. Kelly satisfied the enforcement provisions are strong enough?  Did he consider strengthening those to ensure that where people have remediation orders against them or other aspects, those actions would be enforced, as opposed to being left to linger with all of the negative consequences for communities, the environment, biodiversity and our natural habitat?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#F00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":669,"content":"<p>First of all, the time allowed for the public to consider is clearly one of the key elements of the planning process.  We will absolutely consider a longer period than five weeks.  It will not be in the Act.  It will be in regulations, but we can feed that it into the Oireachtas if and when the legislation proceeds.  We cannot comment on individual cases, such as Derrybrien, but the European Court of Justice case says the decision will be expunged when the development complies with the EIA directive.  We can only know what that will be when the board has carried out its independent assessment and issued its determination.

That is the simple answer.  It depends on a case-by-case basis.  I am aware of circumstances with quarries in which there were high levels of environmental compliance, but an EIA had not been carried out.  When it was carried out retrospectively, the quarries were found to be in full compliance and there was nothing additional to be added to it.  There is no assumption that remediation must automatically occur, but it is very strong.  The powers are there for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ask for it.  This is not a normal planning application.  During the process and before it has issued its determination, the board may intervene and issue an interim order to cease activities on the site.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of other fines in the context of environmental issues.  Derrybrien is very unusual.  This was the second case on the same aspect.  Normally, the issues would be sorted out by then.  In fact, the key aspect of the first Derrybrien case, around 2006, was ensuring legislation was in place and hence the substitute consent process, which was developed with the Commission.  The only remaining piece is that specific project in County Galway.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on why there was no commencement on head 1.  That is dealt with by the drafters.  Normally, if there is no commencement, it commences whenever it is enacted.  We would work that out with the drafters.  We are still engaging with the office of the parliamentary council.  It is not in the scheme because it would normally be added at the Bill drafting stage.<\/p> <p>  Many of the screening criteria, as is the case in the planning system, are addressed in the regulations.  The fact they are being provided for is the key point.  The regulations get into the minutiae of how the screening works.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the lack of Natura 2000 designations, that would be a better question for my colleagues in the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I am not qualified in my role to discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>  One of the last points was on fast-tracking and remediation.  I have touched upon it before.  This is not a normal process or one in which anybody would want to voluntarily be because it means one effectively has an unauthorised development that could be refused.  One may be obliged to take it down or have significant costs to remediate.  If one gets through the process, it shows one has complied with the EIA and habitats directives.  It is not for the benefit of the developers, but the public and the planning authorities involved, that the expertise that has been developed to assess the substitute consent environmental issues is reused or used at the same time.  There would be potential for a single oral hearing with the two applications, if the board so wished.  That would benefit the public and make things clearer and cleaner for everybody involved in the system.<\/p> <p>  Given the work has been done by the board, it would be a waste or a duplication of effort if a local authority had to revisit much of that again and get its own independent expertise in.  Many local authorities do not have or possibly do not need to keep full-time experts in specific, detailed areas of environmental science on their books.  They often hire them in for individual cases.  The fact the work would have been done by the board and it would have considered the difficult environmental issues in many cases would be of benefit to the public and everybody involved in the system.  Yes, it would also be of benefit to the developer, but it is not for his or her benefit it is being put forward.

I am sorry.  A call came through on my computer, so I missed the end of the Chairman's question as I cancelled of the call.  The Chairman is effectively asking me how the deciding authority makes its decision on the basis of damage that has happened.  It is something that An Bord Plean&aacute;la must address in the application.  The EIA must, in terms of its baseline, set out what was there previously.  Under the EIA directive, a part of both remedial and normal EIAs is the consideration of cumulative impacts of a development on the existing environment.  To answer the Chairman&rsquo;s question, it is inherent in the EIA process that, if there is damage, the authority must try to envisage what the site was like previously.  For that reason, remediation is at the heart of the substitute consent process.  Where a substitute consent application is either granted or refused, the planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la may impose remediation conditions.  It is a difficult process to undertake, but unlike EIAs where the development has not happened yet, there is proof in front of us where substitute consent applications are concerned.  There is something that can be monitored, touched, assessed and measured in terms of the damage caused.  It is cold comfort for the environment that has been damaged or impacted, but this approach makes it easier for the authority to assess the damage because the damage is right there in front of it.

Returning to an important point the Chairman made, it is much more difficult to evaluate the level of environmental damage that has been done by an unauthorised development when there is not an original baseline.  Thus while one might have evidence, one does not have evidence about how much damage has been done from the period when the unauthorised development happened.  I would be interested to hear how that can be adequately addressed in the assessments, as well as the requirements to remediate.  Also, I am not so sure everybody would agree the wording of section 1770 has stood up to the level of legal scrutiny but I will not press the point as Mr. Kelly has answered it clearly.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to head 4, section 37L.  The officials may correct me if I am wrong about the following.  Let us say I am, for example, the owner of a quarry.  I have been fully compliant with planning law, namely, I applied for planning permission, did an appropriate EIA and am working away.  If I then want to expand my activities, I apply to the local authority for planning permission.  Somebody can then appeal it to the board.  The person who has done everything right and has been fully legally compliant must go through a two-stage process when he or she wants to expand his or her operations.  At the same time, the Department is proposing here that where somebody who has an unauthorised development - in other words, somebody who has broken the rules and now must regularise that and demonstrate whether there have been any negative environmental consequences - also wants to expand his or her business, he or she gets a fast-track one-stage planning application.  It does not have to do with the substitute consent, which is dealt with, as Mr. Kelly said, by the technical expertise of the board.  However, for any expansion of the business, if I was the person who had done everything right and complied fully, I would be saying that does not make any sense.  I have yet to hear a compelling argument as to why, separate from the substitute consent application going through the board, which I understand, in parallel to regularising any environmental damage caused by the unauthorised development if such is required, that applicant should get access to a fast-track planning process for something that is entirely separate in terms of a new planning application.  Perhaps the officials can enlighten me as to why we would reward the unauthorised development to the detriment of those who have obeyed the rules.  I just do not understand it.<\/p> <p>  Will they also outline how all of this would affect any of the substitute consent applications currently in the pipleline?  I presume it does not affect them as they operate under the rules that were in place when they entered into the process.  Was any consideration given to transitional arrangements to try to address that?<\/p> <p>  I asked two questions in the last round which the officials were not able to answer.  On the screening determinations and the detail in the regulations, will the officials provide the committee with a written note on that in advance of the full Bill?  On the Natura 2000 designations, while I appreciate I can go to the NPWS, I am sure there is somebody in the Department who has expertise on that.  Maybe they can provide us with a written note on that as well.  The officials might reply to the first few questions and if I have time, I have a few more after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#J01100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":714,"content":"<p>That is no problem.  First of all, section 37L is not a fast-track process.  Most of the substitute consent cases have taken well over a year on average.  It is only allowed for those in exceptional circumstances.  I do not mean to pick the Deputy up on it but the actual example he used of the quarry is in at the moment.  They are the one development that actually does have that facility as it currently stands.  The point of it is that it is for those developments which have got through the process and have effectively shown they are compliant.  Again, it may be through no fault of their own.  It is not for their benefit but for the benefit of the public, so they can see what future development is happening at the same time, potentially in one oral hearing, although again that is up to the board.  It is also to allow the assessment of what went before to be built on what goes into the future.  I can understand the point the Deputy is making.  It is almost as if to impose, say, a delay on those who have an authorised development but it is important to note inherent in the system is that they could be refused.  They have a far greater risk in terms of going into the substitute consent because they have actually voluntarily done an unauthorised development and they now have the risk of having to remediate it all at a massive cost whereas the person who goes through the normal process has not yet built the development and has not on the inherent risk that goes with that.  The fact is this is so rare.  There are between 27,000 and 29,000 planning applications every year and four or five substitute consent applications.  It really is an exceptional circumstance in the normal sphere of things.  It is up to all the experts, namely, the independent planning system of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to assess what went before and not to have to duplicate that again.  What we are talking about is putting an extra burden on the system.  If substitute consent is granted - again, in many cases it is not - and an applicant has to carry out any remedial development he or she has cleared the requirements as far as the EIA is concerned.  If applications go back to the local authority and are appealed to the board again, members of the public might not be aware and they might get confused as to what is going on.<\/p><p>We just see this as a general benefit.

The concern is that somebody could break the rules and carry out unauthorised development, causing significant environmental and community damage.  This person could get substitute consent, even if it includes conditions in respect of remediation, but would also get to expand his or her business.  As a result of the enforcement of those conditions being so weak, this person could delay the remediation while ploughing ahead with the expansion of the business.

Such developers will have had to come into the system to try to regularise their unauthorised development.  They will potentially have had to take on significant costs to remediate what they have done, if remediation conditions are applied.  It is not something that any developer should do voluntarily.  I know I keep repeating myself but nobody wants to enter a substitute consent process voluntarily because there is a risk that the consent will be refused, meaning that whatever has been built must be removed and that the site must be remediated and returned to the state it was in before anything was built.

I asked a specific question about section 177D(2)(<i>g<\/i>) which contains the phrase &quot;such other matters as the Board considers relevant&quot;.  Will Mr. Kelly give us an indication of what such matters these are likely to be?  Was legal advice sought on the appropriateness of that provision?<\/p><p>While I know that, again, this is in the existing legislation, we will tease out another concern of mine since the departmental officials are here.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 uses the term &quot;shall have regard to&quot; as opposed to, for example, &quot;must comply with&quot;.  Does that mean that the board can take a pick and mix attitude to the seven or eight conditions listed in section 177D(2)?  Do they all have to be adhered to?  Will Mr. Kelly talk us through that a little more?<\/p><p>Will the witnesses explain the rationale behind head 11?  I am a little bit unclear on that from reading the text.  Under section 177K, the board will be obliged to conduct an appropriate assessment or EIA  Given that one of the reasons that substitute consent applications are being made is that an EIA or appropriate assessment was not carried out in the first place, how often is the board required to carry such assessments out at this stage?  <\/p><p>I will come back to the issue of enforcement.  We all know of cases in our constituencies in which local authorities have worked hard to try to enforce the regularisation of developments that have been found to be in breach of the conditions of their planning permission.  It is incredibly difficult.  Given that the board has far lower levels of staff and far greater numbers of cases on hand, albeit very specific cases in this instance, did the Department examine whether the levels of enforcement of existing remediation conditions are adequate or how long it takes to enforce those conditions?  I know I keep going back to the case of Derrybrien but it is one of the most extreme examples.  I can think of quarries in my own constituency and other unauthorised developments.  In these cases, enforcement is the most difficult phase, even more so than getting a decision.  The negative impacts of unauthorised development can carry on for long periods, even when enforcement orders or remediation conditions have been applied.  Is this an area that needs to be strengthened?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#K01300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633388400,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I will start with section 177D(2)(g) regarding the criteria for determining exceptionality, specifically \"such other matters as the Board considers relevant\".  This is effectively a matter for the board.  This provision allows the board to consider any matters it considers germane, in addition to the other criteria, each of which must also be considered.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we received legal advice on this.  The legal advice was first sought ten or 11 years ago when this legislation was first drafted.  We have since gone back over it to seek the legal advice of the current Attorney General.  That criterion is additional and does not weaken the other criteria that are to be assessed.  It is to be used by the board on a case-by-case basis.  I will not speculate on what additional issues might be considered but the key point is that the criteria that come before this one all comply with the EIA directive and the Derrybrien decision.  To answer the Deputy's question, we have numerous pieces of legal advice, including recent advice on this drafting as part of the Supreme Court case last year and advice from years ago from files.  The Attorneys General were very much involved in drafting the specific wording.  The Deputy also asked whether the board can pick and mix criteria.  The answer is \"No.\"  The board shall consider all of those criteria.  <\/p> <p>  Enforcement is still a function of the local authority.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has powers within the substitute consent process because it assesses the application.  It can, at that time, issue instructions to the developer to cease activities but, ultimately, the enforcement function remains with the local authority.  The question of resourcing may be a question for another day, but it has been assessed by colleagues who have come before the committee.  It is always something that needs to be looked at.  If it is the case that there are additional resourcing issues, that will be addressed by my colleagues rather than by me as part of the management of this Bill.  I appreciate that the issue is inherent.  We have looked at it and at how enforcement interacts with this.  Again, we are happy.  We have received advice and our enforcement process, from the investigative powers of the local authorities right up to injunctions under section 160, is available for local authorities to use.  We always encourage the local authorities to use their powers but how to carry out the enforcement process is still, ultimately, an independent decision for each local authority, once it complies with the process.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's questions but, in summary, we have consulted heavily with Attorneys General on this legislation.<\/p><p>If anything, it came from recent court cases.  Its genesis, therefore, has effectively come from legal considerations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021100500002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633388400,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly.

People in all constituencies are frustrated when a development is found to be in breach of the planning process, councils pursue the avenues open to them yet they are hamstrung in what they can do ultimately.  Resourcing is one element at the heart of this issue.  I would like the witnesses to take this aspect up with their colleagues.  I refer, in the context of this proposed legislation, to the need to beef up the enforcement element within local authorities.  While additional resources are going to be provided to planning sections in local authorities to speed up applications, we must also be mindful of cases where wrongdoing occurs.
