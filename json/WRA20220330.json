On 6 October 2021 the application was refused for a number of reasons. The applicant was informed of this decision on 6 October 2021 and of their right to request a review of the decision within 28 days from the date of the refusal letter that issued. No request for a review was received.<\/p>  <p>  All employment permits granted are employer and employee specific and therefore cannot be transferred from one employer to another.  This means that if a permit holder ceases employment with a company, they must first obtain a new employment permit before entering new employment. <\/p>  <p>  It is understood that the employment permit previously held by the employee concerned was in respect of a different employer, and has since expired.  If that employment permit was still valid, it cannot be used to enable the employee to be employed by a different employer as they are not the employer specified on the permit. It therefore would have been necessary for a new employment permit to be applied for in the new employer&rsquo;s name, which in this case was not done. It is not possible to change the name of an employer on an employment permit that has issued. Therefore, it appears that the employee was working for the new employer for a number of months without a valid employment permit.<\/p>  <p>  Information in relation to changing employers is available on the Department&rsquo;s website and can be  accessed through the following link:- enterprise.gov.ie\/en\/What-We-Do\/Workplace-and-Skills\/Employment-Permits\/Changing-Employer\/.  <\/p>  <p>  Details in relation to changing employers is also contained in a FAQ document on my Department&rsquo;s website which answers the majority of questions in relation to employment permits and it can be accessed through the following link:- enterprise.gov.ie\/en\/Publications\/Publication-files\/Employment-Permits-FAQs-2020.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  It is noted that the employee concerned had issues with the employer named on the employment permit and that he had made a complaint to the WRC in relation to these issues in March 2021 during the Covid 19 pandemic. However due to the restrictions it was not possible for the WRC to carry out an inspection on this employer.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is recommended that a new application be submitted for a general employment permit. Such an application should comply with all of the legislative requirements for the particular employment permit type by addressing the reasons for the refusal of the application submitted in June 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000065#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000065#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[16951\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000065#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the Government&rsquo;s position on the proposed TRIPS waiver on mRNA Covid-19 vaccines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":15,"content":"<p>Universal and equitable access to safe, effective and affordable vaccines, diagnostics and treatments is crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  International Trade is a competence of the EU under the Treaties and in exercising that competence, the European Commission engages fully with the Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committees and Working Parties\/Groups, including on Intellectual Property.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, the EU has participated in the informal discussions on the intellectual property element of the WTO response to the COVID-19 pandemic with representatives of South Africa, India, and the US, known as the &lsquo;Quad&rsquo; group.

That is why, on 15 March 2022, the Government approved an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme &ndash; to address cost pressures in the sector. Details on how to avail of the scheme will be communicated directly to licensed hauliers as soon as possible by my officials using the contact email address held by the Department&rsquo;s Road Transport Operator Licensing Unit. <\/p>  <p>  You will also be aware that on 09 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, it should be noted that the Diesel Rebate Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators when the price of diesel is high. In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre. In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase has been maintained since.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel. Currently, however, the EU Energy Tax Directive limits the possibility of further reducing the tax on fuel. Specifically, the Directive requires a minimum tax of &euro;0.33 per litre and the measures already decided have reduced the tax on diesel to the minimum. <\/p>  <p>  In general, it should be recalled that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure announced on 09 March, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme approved on 15 March 2022, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. However, we must accept that it will not be possible to insulate citizens and businesses from the full impact of these fuel price increases. In providing 8 weeks emergency support with these sudden increased costs, the Government is seeking to cushion the shock of the rapid spike in fuel prices. While it remains to be seen how fuel prices evolve it is imperative that haulage businesses engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their services to reflect the increasing costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000065#WRB06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000066#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[16926\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000066#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a medical report is valid for five years, the reason this cannot be accepted by the National Driver Licence Service when applying for a licence, when it advises it must be within three months (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

An Action Plan Implementation report, which was published earlier this month, shows that 80 per cent of these actions have now been delivered. Among the developments so far are the introduction of the new Personal Injury Guidelines in April 2021; the enactment of the<i>Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021<\/i>; and the establishment of the Insurance Fraud Coordination Office within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market was also established within the Department of Finance and is chaired by Minister of State Fleming. Its role is to assist in reducing insurance costs by promoting competition in this market.<\/p><p>Since its establishment, the Office has held over 60 meetings with a wide range of key stakeholders, including representative bodies, providers and other civic society groups, particularly those in &lsquo;pinch point&rsquo; sectors who are experiencing issues around the accessibility and affordability of insurance, to understand the gaps in the Irish insurance market. The Office has also met with bodies that have a competition remit, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the IDA, as well as liaising regularly with industry representative groups such as Insurance Ireland and Brokers Ireland. Recently it also met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland, who have confirmed that they are passing on the savings achieved by the new Personal Injury Guidelines, and other reforms, to customers. In this regard, it should be noted that recent data from the Personal Injury Assessment Board (PIAB) show that since the implementation of these new Guidelines, award levels have fallen by an average of 40 per cent, thereby providing stability and certainty to the claims environment. <\/p><p>A key priority now for Government is maintaining momentum in insurance reform with the focus now shifting to implementing the outstanding elements of the Action Plan.

In some cases anticipated shortages coincide with existing political challenges, and may increase internal tensions.  While sub-Saharan African countries are less dependent on imports from Ukraine and Russia, pre-existing food insecurity will be magnified in part because of limited abilities to address increases in food prices, with climate change and the pandemic also impacting on both food production and fiscal space.  The outcome of 2022 harvests will be critical to food availability in the second half of the year and food prices into next year.<\/p><p>Our missions in the Middle East, North and sub-Saharan Africa are closely monitoring the food security situation, and the associated risk of political instability.<\/p><p>I am particularly conscious that the World Food Programme is reliant on grain stocks from Ukraine.

A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I am very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on what has been a long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for these staff under grant schemes, and that where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  On that basis, there has been extensive engagement between my Department and school management bodies to work towards a resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the willingness of F&oacute;rsa and in particular the school secretary representatives for their constructive engagement in this process, and to recognise the support of Minister McGrath and his officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at all stages of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The final element of the package will introduce standardised arrangements in respect of annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.<\/p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement will include a complex process of assimilating each individual secretary to the new terms and conditions which will vary depending on individual circumstances.

The nomination and referral process is initiated by parents and professionals at school level via the Principal following a multi-disciplinary school based review involving the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the local Special Educational Needs Officer (SENO) and other relevant professionals. Nominations cannot be made directly to Middletown Centre for Autism (MCA), the Department of Education or the NCSE.  <\/p>  <p>  Nominations for MCA Referral are only considered for children and young people where such a review concludes despite comprehensive autism specific support and consistent engagement from school and home with first-tier services, the child or young person continues to present with significant and enduring behavioural and emotional concerns which impact their engagement and participation in education.

In order to afford the teachers time to complete one or both processes well in advance of their renewal date, regular communications regarding the re-vetting process commenced in November 2021 and renewal reminders began in February 2022. However, despite the early notifications, an Chomhairle is currently experiencing a high level of emails and phone calls in relation to these processes and has put in place additional phone support, developed a &lsquo;Step- by -Step Guide&rsquo; and updated the Frequently Asked Questions.

The review is expected to consider eligibility for civil legal aid, the issues for which legal aid should be available, and what should be prioritised for support given the limitations on resources.   The review may also contain a research element which could, among other things, identify international approaches to supporting people with legal assistance needs.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Civil Legal Aid Scheme was established over 40 years ago, Irish society has changed and the demands on the Scheme have grown. In order to provide maximum benefit to those it was established to serve, within the finite resources available to fund legal aid, a robust, comprehensive review of the Scheme is now timely.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately the review should map out a future for the Civil Legal Aid Scheme; one which will provide for a flexible service that has, as far as possible, the capacity and resources to respond to the priority legal assistance needs of those of insufficient means.<\/p>  <p>  Dependent on finalisation of the approach and confirmation of membership, it is envisaged that the Review Group will commence its work early this year.<\/p>  <p>  Section 27(2) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides that the Legal Aid Board can only provide legal representation at certain inquests, in the civil courts, or in Tribunals prescribed by me with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The only tribunal currently so prescribed is the International Protection Appeals Tribunal. It should be noted that this provision only applies to legal aid, i.e. representation by a lawyer in court\/at the Tribunal. It does not preclude the Legal Aid Board from giving legal advice in relation to a matter which might be heard by a tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  That being the case, while the Legal Aid Board does not provide representation in relation to internal disciplinary or external workplace relations hearings, it does provide advice and assistance in relation to employment matters. The Board can also, subject to the means and merits criteria, provide legal aid in statutory appeals from tribunals to the court. For example, a statutory appeal from the Workplace Relations Commission to the Circuit Court in an equality matter can be granted legal aid subject to the criteria being satisfied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000070#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Court Procedures","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000070#WRG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[16919\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000070#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will transition justice system terminology to a more modern English equivalent which would replace Latin terminology and phrases such as ad litem, thus aiding greater comprehension by the general public.","asker":"1570","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The Report of the Review of the Administration of Civil Justice, published in 2020, made a number of recommendations regarding reform of our civil justice system.

The Courts Service agreed to take this recommendation forward through its Access to Justice Civil Reform User Group.  <\/p>  <p>  Through this Group, which officials in my Department participate on, and the extensive stakeholder engagement undertaken by the Courts Service as part of its modernisation efforts, the Courts Service is best placed to identify opportunities to engage with rules committees regarding opportunities for simplification of procedure and language.<\/p>  <p>  This is underpinned by the Courts Service&rsquo;s Long-Term Strategic Vision for 2030, and its Modernisation Programme which adopts a User-Centric Approach, seeking to ensure a better understanding of the needs of those who interact with the courts system and the Courts Service.

While it is difficult to be certain about timelines, following these assurance steps I am hopeful we could proceed to approval-in-principle (Gate 1 of the Public Spending Code) before the summer recess.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of receiving approval-in-principle from Government in line with the PSC, it would be premature to commit to any specific timeline, other than to say that the Department is proceeding with the expedient development of PSC compliant business cases in order to deliver additional elective ambulatory capacity in line with the Government decision of December 2021 provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":401,"content":"<p>Question No. 137 answered with Question No. 136.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH04100"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[16842\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of addiction recovery housing beds intended for use for Ukrainian refugees.","asker":"1453","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":404,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[16843\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if any addiction rehabilitation or detox beds will be used for Ukrainian refugees.","asker":"1453","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":405,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.<\/p><p>The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is responsible for the provision of accommodation for Ukrainian refugees who do not have access to private accommodation.

The IBTS have advised that it is launching a National radio and digital media campaign (including Social media \/ video on demand and digital out of home) week commencing Monday the 4th of April. This campaign will last for three weeks leading up to the Easter holiday. It is expected that this will raise the visibility of the critical importance of blood donation and attending clinics.<\/p><p>  The IBTS was running a very successful award winning &lsquo;everyone counts&rsquo; campaign in 2018\/2019 which had to be paused when the COVID-19 pandemic  and the subsequent public health guidelines forced the organisation to adapt its mode of operation.<\/p><p>  Before the pandemic the IBTS was attracting circa 18,000 new donors each year but due to the public health  guidelines the organisation needed to introduce  an appointment only based donation clinic model for all blood donation clinics and stopped the traditional  &lsquo;walk-in clinics&rsquo; . IBTS clinics have continued to run throughout the pandemic despite numerous challenges regarding donor availability, staff availability and venue availability with advertising focusing on promoting clinics locally as they are organised and confirmed. A key part of ensuring these local clinics are successful is concentrating  on existing donors to reduce the time donors would spend on clinic, and focusing on those donors most likely to be eligible to donate at any given clinic.<\/p><p>  As public health guidelines and the impact of the pandemic reduce, the IBTS intends to resume the &lsquo;everyone counts&rsquo; campaign and once again have a constant ongoing National message raising the importance of blood donation. It is hoped that this will once again attract new donors to support the loyal  regular donor base that has seen us through the pandemic to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":413,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05200"},{"type":"question","counter":414,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[16879\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the rationale for the decision by the HSE mid-west division to transfer three residents who are suffering with serious mental health issues and residing at a location (details supplied) from the care of the HSE to a housing association; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that each of these residents has been presented with a 29-page contract, which has caused confusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":415,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05500"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[16881\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that edited minutes of Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland board meetings have not been publicly available since January 2021 in view of commitments to publish minutes following the publication of the Crowe Howarth report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>As the issue raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the NMBI, I have asked NMBI to respond directly to the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000071#WRH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[16882\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000072#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the current organisational structure chart for the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland will be provided; if it will include numbers of all staff working in each directorate by tenure, that is, permanent, consultant, contract, agency or other; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>As the issue raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the NMBI, I have asked NMBI to respond directly to the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000072#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000072#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[16883\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022033000072#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a report on a protected disclosure has not yet been finalised (details supplied); when the report with findings will be made available relating to this protected disclosure from the outsourced investigator; if he will provide all costings accrued to date relating to this protected disclosure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>The protected disclosure mentioned by the Deputy raised allegations of such seriousness, that my predecessor as Minister for Health, Simon Harris, decided to conduct a review of the disclosure made, under Section 27(9) of the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011.

The resulting curtailment of elective care (and associated staff shortages) will likely negatively impact achieving waiting list reduction targets.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. <\/p>  <p>  The Waiting List Task Force continues to regularly monitor the impact of COVID-19 on waiting list reduction targets. Additional capacity is being sought through the Private Hospitals to minimise the impact of the current surge on core capacity.<\/p>  <p>  With the onset of the 4th wave of Covid-19 at the end of December 2021 and January 2022 the HSE with the support of the Department negotiated a new amended Agreement with the Private Hospitals to run to the end of June 2022.  The new Agreement sought to draw on the lessons from the operation of Safety Nets 2 and 3. <\/p>  <p>  The most significant change from the previous Safety Net Agreements was the adoption of a dual approach to obtaining access to the private hospital capacity.  As with the outgoing agreement it would allow access of up to 15% or 30% of the private hospitals&rsquo; capacity depending on which metrics were met.  At each level, the HSE would have the option to seek access on either a reasonable endeavours basis i.e. voluntarily, or by issuing a guaranteed capacity demand, which would require the private hospitals to provide the capacity. Under the agreement payments for capacity unused by the public system i.e. retainer payments will not be payable where the agreement is invoked on a reasonable endeavours basis but will be payable where a guaranteed capacity notice is issued. <\/p>  <p>  In August 2021 the HSE established a procurement framework to allow public hospitals to access services in private hospitals.  The procurement framework that was put in place sought tenders from private hospitals, based on competitive pricing, for approximately 700 types of medical and surgical procedures for adult and paediatric inpatient, day care and critical care beds.

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme is a once-off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20th March 2022. The first tranche of payments was made last week, with the remaining applications due for processing as soon as possible. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. <\/p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme.
