Are the minutes of 10 October agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  In category A, No. 2451, dated 10 October, and No. 2466 from Caranua are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  Is it agreed that we note and publish these?  Agreed.  Category B is from Accounting Officers and their Ministers in follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts, and other items for publication.  The first is No. 2432 from Ms Katherine Licken, Secretary General, Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, dated 4 October 2019 providing an update relating to the post-project review requested by the committee of the P&aacute;l&aacute;s cinema project.  Related correspondence is No. 2465, also from Ms Licken, dated 15 October enclosing a copy of the mentioned post-project review.  We will note and publish this.  I brought along the periodic report No. 3 which the Committee of Public Accounts published in July 2018, in which there is a specific chapter, including timelines, on the Galway arthouse cinema.<\/p><p>We made a number of recommendations, including the need for a post-project review.  That is referred to in this report.

We will hold it over.  I have comments on the specifics, which we will come to next week.<\/p> <p>  I have a general point on this post-project review process.  I am sure the members will agree with what I have to say.  This had to be published on budget day and it has come to us now.  I will not discuss the recommendations because they relate to the specifics of the report but the gist is that the culture section of the Department should learn lessons from what happened.  This review was approved by that Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before it was published.  The scope of a post-project review for any project in future must include recommendations from which the public sector can learn.  There are clear lessons to be learned from this that could have benefits across the public sector if they are implemented.  Everything in this report has a very narrow focus on this project and one section in one Department that should learn from what took place.  It is too narrow in terms of the scope of its recommendations.  All future post-project reviews must extract specific lessons and when they go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it must see what benefits can be obtained across the public sector.  This report displays a silo mentality and focuses narrowly on one project, one section and one Department.  All the recommendations are confined to that Department.  I suspect that because it is so narrow in its conclusions, there will be no learning process across the wider public service.  It will be deemed to be for a specific narrow area.  All spending reviews in future must have a section on learning lessons across the public sector.  Any report I see that does not have it in future will be seriously challenged by this committee as not being effective in terms of learning the required lessons.<\/p> <p>  I will not get into the specifics.  I expect Deputy Connolly will have much to say about the matter on the next occasion.  It is a comprehensive report and we need to devote some time to its examination.  I am happy to postpone that examination having made some general comments.  They pertain to more than just the specifics of the case.  This came from an earlier report of the Committee of Public Accounts and it is why we have a particular interest in it.  We will publish the reply and hold it over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I welcome that it was published on the day of the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#B00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We note and welcome its publication and we will hold it over for a detailed discussion next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#B00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>This came up last week, albeit in a more abstract way, when we discussed the leases pertaining to the National Transport Authority and the Commission for Taxi Regulation.

People like to keep things in silos as if they have nothing to do with the rest of us.  This has everything to do with every Department that spends taxpayers' money.  This is a broad matter and we will come back to it.<\/p> <p>  No. 2434 is correspondence from Mr. Mark Ferguson, director general, Science Foundation Ireland, dated 8 October 2019, responding to our request for information regarding the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas of the accounts and financial statements of Science Foundation Ireland.  We were concerned about the late arrival of these accounts.  Mr. Ferguson advises that he has referred our query to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which is responsible for laying the accounts before the Oireachtas and they will let us know the position.  I wish to let people know that we are continuing to follow up on this.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has indicated separately that in the year to date there has been a continued improvement in parties submitting their accounts for audit within three months of the year end.  We have made that a little part of our mission.  We will note and publish this item.<\/p> <p>  No. 2436 is correspondence from Mr. Gerard Dollard, chief executive officer, Irish Greyhound Board, dated 7 October 2019, providing information requested by the committee at our meeting on 19 September.  I will detail the types of matters included.  They comprise details of animal welfare cases and the number of inspections of kennels, at approximately 500 per year.  He lists catering, which was outsourced, and he was asked about a separate care fund established by the Irish Greyhound Board for greyhounds retired from racing.  There was a question about the rehoming organisations for greyhounds and the grants given to various organisations.  These are quite small, with several at &euro;3,000, although there are one or two bigger examples.  They are not major sums.  He also dealt with the foster care process.  It is good to know about this.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dollard also dealt with the breakdown of consultancy fees for 2017 because the issue was raised at our meeting.  The &euro;663,000 paid by the organisation in one year for those services is phenomenal.  Legal consultancy fees amounted to &euro;138,000, taxation and financial advice amounted to &euro;12,500 but there also different reviews taking in strategic and organisational restructuring totalling &euro;227,000.  That comprised work by Preferred Results at &euro;130,000, Tandem Consulting at &euro;12,000, Professor Dermot Duff at &euro;4,800 and Power Economics Limited at &euro;6,690.  We made the point here that there appeared to be four consultants examining the organisational structure within a relatively short period.  It defies logic to an extent.  There is also mention of public relations and marketing consultancy, as well as pensions and fees management and human resources consultancy fees.  The four different consultants involved with strategic and organisational restructuring being paid in one year seems extraordinary, and that is why we highlighted the matter.<\/p> <p>  We asked for details of travel expenses as they were not provided on the day.  The vast majority of people, or almost 90%, get less than &euro;5,000 and they have to travel to race meetings all over the country.  That is not unreasonable.  We asked about the spend on welfare and the information is included.  There is also information on the impairment review summary for 2018, specifically asset and capital grant impairment.  It is quite technical.  There is also a section on organisational restructuring, which has some redaction as various individuals are mentioned.  Generally, it is a comprehensive reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I will come back to the consultancy spend as we have raised this at a high level in the context of how much money the State or organisations funded by it are spending on consultancy.  It is similar to what we are doing with other matters and when we see consultancy spend we should seek a breakdown of what exactly the money is being spent on.  We must examine this a bit more closely.<\/p><p>There is a lot of change management within the Civil Service.  I imagine that there is a great deal of commonality involved when change is taking place.  When money is being spent on strategic and organisational restructuring, that happens as a matter of routine across many Departments and organisation.  There are examples of it when very large changes are being made.  For example, in the context of technological universities, a lot of change management has to take place in order to merge two institutes to become a new university.  There were issues around the level of consultancy being used to fund all of that.  However, there is a broader point about where lessons can be learned and how they can be applied.  There are also lessons regarding consistency, guidelines and in-house expertise.<\/p><p> The point we made at the previous meeting is that it is far too easy for organisations funded by the taxpayer to reach out to private consultants or to get consultancy firms to carry out some work before decisions are made.  However, it is the same firms doing the same work, often with the same recommendations.  There is a need to examine this in terms of whether we are getting value for money and if enough is being done by the line Departments that fund these organisations to ensure that better direction is given and that better guidelines are in place in the context of how transition and change are managed.  There is a lot of money involved.  The question I asked on the previous occasion was whether it is possible to get a figure for, say, 2018.  How much did the taxpayer spend on consultancy?  The clerk to the committee is shaking his head.  It might be difficult to get that figure but we should be able to get it.  Every Department should be able to come back to us and tell us how they fund the different organisations and what they spend on consultancy.  Is it listed in their accounts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#B01200","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571299200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It should be, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>It is a desk-top exercise for somebody.

The point mentioned by Deputy Catherine Murphy relates to this correspondence as well.  Some five weeks ago representatives from Bord na gCon were here and we asked for information, all of which we now have.  On the same day, I spoke specifically about the Irish Coursing Club.  It is intended that body will now register all new-born dogs.  That information will then be transferred to the Irish Greyhound Board's database, if the dogs concerned are going to be involved in greyhound racing.<\/p> <p>  We inquired about the Irish Coursing Club.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine replied that it was nothing to do with it because it was a private organisation and did not get any funding from that Department.  I am amazed to hear that we are handing over that function to a private organisation that probably has charitable status and which has zero accountability to the Department or to this House.  We asked the Department for a note on whether a traceability system similar to that used for cattle or bovines was explored for greyhounds.  We also asked for a detailed briefing on the Irish Coursing Club, its role in greyhound traceability, Bord na gCon's reliance on its system and the level of assurance provided to the Department regarding the process.<\/p> <p>  We asked the Accounting Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for that information some five weeks ago.  We have not received it and that is not acceptable.  It is fortuitous that representatives of that Department will appear before this committee next week as part of our work programme.  The answers to those questions will be the first item on the agenda, and it will be six weeks since we made the request.  While it is fortuitous that the Accounting Office is here next week, had he not been scheduled to appear, he would be coming in specifically to give us an answer as to why we have not received that information after six weeks.  I make this point to all Departments.  If they do not provide the information requested within four weeks, their representatives will be back here in week five to explain to the public why questions were not answered.  <\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is lucky.  Its representatives happen to be here next week.  I think my point is well made.  I am tired, as the Chairman, wondering if we got replies to questions we asked five, eight and even ten weeks ago.  We should not have to wait that long.  Departments should be efficient.  If it was a case of a parliamentary question, there would be an obligation on a Department to answer it promptly and a request from this committee should be treated with the same sense of urgency.  We are obliging the Accounting Officers by giving them time to provide us with written responses.  They should come to this committee prepared to answer most questions in the first place.  The letter of invitation to all Accounting Officers states that they have to make someone available to appear before the committee.  That is so information can be provided to the committee during the hearings.  They normally run for a few hours.  We have taken a lenient approach by deciding to allow answers in writing in due course.  We are not, however, going to accept this delay of a month in future.  I have said this before, but I think my point is well made now and we will follow through on it.  We will note and publish the correspondence received.  My other comments have been well noted regarding the situation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  The next item is No. 2440B from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, dated 8 October 2019.  It provides an information note on the difference between the national debt and general Government debt.  I am going to summarise this for the public.  We got a very detailed answer from the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance reconciling one to the other.<\/p> <p>  The gross national debt consists of Irish Government bonds and borrowing from the EU and the IMF, short-term borrowing from ministerial funds and State savings products, excluding the post office savings account.  That is the gross national debt, because those moneys are owed to all those people.  The national debt is the net debt derived from the gross national debt by subtracting cash Exchequer balances in respect of any liquid assets on hand, as well as non-liquid assets such as the Housing Finance Agency guaranteed notes, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, term loans and credit support account collateral funding.  That is the net situation, consisting of the gross national debt minus cash and other resources that could reasonably be converted to cash.  That is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. <\/p> <p>  General Government debt is a measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State.  It is assessed by the CSO and takes into account the debt and liabilities of central and local government and Government funds such as the Social Insurance Fund.  We have been provided with a detailed note on all this, but generally the gross national debt is how much we owe, the net debt is that figure, generally, minus the cash balances and perhaps assets held by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland that could be made liquid fairly easily.  General Government debt is the measure of the total gross consolidated debt of the State, which includes other agencies such as local authorities.  I am summarising it and it is not 100% accurate, but it is as accurate as people will appreciate.  The full note is several pages long, giving a full reconciliation of the national debt to the general Government debt.  It is great reading and I encourage people with an interest to read it.  It is good to ask the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#D01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>We should send it on to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.

We asked the commission to identify the industry sectors of these high appeals.  The commission states it cannot do so because that might identify the parties involved in the big sectors.  The level of debt at the tax appeals commission has been increasing.  The commission was established in March 2016 and by the end of 2016 the quantum of cases on hand was &euro;1.4 billion.  It then got &euro;600 million of new cases, meaning that at the end of 2017 there was &euro;2 billion in outstanding cases on its desk.  In 2018, it had five high value appeals which brought the debt to &euro;4 billion.  Those cases had a value of &euro;2 billion between them.  Obviously, if the commission were to identify the sector, it would make the organisations in question easily identifiable.  Of interest is that to date in 2019 the quantum of appeals closed by the commission has exceeded the quantum of new appeals received by &euro;300 million, resulting in a current balance of appeals on hand of approximately &euro;3.7 billion.

For example, if there is an adjudication of &euro;100 million, the liability will end up being &euro;10 million.  I acknowledge that we do not need to see the individual cases, but we need some sort of profile of what the settlements end up being because while a figure of &euro;3.7 billion is eye watering, it is a different matter if only 10% of that is realised.

Sometimes it is paid and sometimes it is not.  We have asked for details of the amounts collected following the publication of the appeals.  We will receive those figures.

This was addressed in the Budget Statement.  All members are aware that the Government totally underestimated the task before the Tax Appeals Commission when it was established on a statutory basis.  There was insufficient provision in terms of the number of appeals commissioners and other staff, as well as resources.  The organisation established by the Government was not fit for the task ahead of it.  When one sets up a new body, it will attract new interest.  It has been playing catch-up.  There are some historic appeals.  Its funding has been significantly increased this year.<\/p><p>I think there was legislation to increase the number of commissioners the other day or I spoke on that issue somewhere recently.<\/p><p> Between 2019 and 2020 there were significant increases in resources to the Tax Appeals Commission for staffing and commissioners.  It is playing catch-up and I accept it did not get it right at the beginning.<\/p><p> I just want to make an observation on the consultancy issue.  I would like the Office of Government Procurement to come in on this at a later stage when we collate the information.  Take the case of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I suspect this is what is happening.  There is a myriad of Government bodies and agencies which have to handle this.  They go to the Office of Government Procurement to get a firm of consultants to deal with it.  One could find ten different Government agencies ending up with the same company asking for a brief on how to handle GDPR.  Given that the company will have done the job for the first agency, all it has to do is change the cover and charge the full price for the next nine.  I have seen this happen before.  All the big firms know they will be called upon.  They have taken on big operations to deal with these queries.  Say the company charges &euro;20,000 for a project.  Then another similar sized agency comes along.  All the company has to do is change the cover and the names on it and the job is 99% the same.  That is my concern.<\/p><p> I will be asking the Office of Government Procurement to look at categories of procurement.  If there are umpteen agencies putting out a similar tender independently, is there any way of getting a reduced rate on the basis that one will get a similar project from ten organisations as opposed to a once-off?

This goes back to questions I put to the Commissioner on an individual.  Her name is in the public domain but I will not use it.  It concerns an individual who was arrested on suspicion of fraud relating to sick leave.  At the time, it was an extraordinary situation where proper due process was not followed.  There was no proper internal process followed where the person would have an opportunity to account for herself.  It seems it went straight to a criminal investigation.  A very strange arrest was made and then the case went to court where it was dismissed.<\/p> <p>  We asked the Garda Commissioner several questions on process.  I am not satisfied with the responses we got from the Garda Commissioner.  I have no problem with the first two responses because he cannot be across every detail of every case.  He was not aware that the individual in question had made a further complaint and he was not aware of a mediation process.  He accepted that when he was before us.<\/p> <p>  However, another issue concerns the exit survey the individual did.  My understanding is that she claimed bullying occurred.  We asked whether this was a pattern in this particular Garda station.  We asked for a breakdown of the exit surveys and whether any instances of bullying or harassment had been cited.  We asked that the response include a breakdown for Store Street Garda station.  We were not looking for individuals&rsquo; details just the data.  The response is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no record of any person citing bullying and-or harassment in an exit survey.  It is qualified, however, by stating that exit surveys are conducted by local management and there is no organisational policy in place in this regard.  That does not answer the question.  It may well be that there are such instances but that they are not logged at a local level and the data are not collated.  We need to tell the Garda to go back to the superintendents in the Garda stations and local managers and have them provide the data.  If there is no structure in place for collating data, that is not our problem.  That is the Garda's problem.<\/p> <p>  We also asked for information on the number of cases where civilians and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were arrested for suspected fraud relating to sick notes.  The response is that between 2016 and 2019, three disciplinary investigations were undertaken to investigate allegations concerning the altering of medical certificates and the claiming of allowances while on sick leave.  We would not stand over any that if there were instances.  It does not answer the question, however, as to whether any of these cases led to criminal investigations.  I am taking from the reply that the answer is \"No\" apart from this one case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#F00800","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>One was found to be not in breach, one we do not know about and the other is still ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#F00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>No.  These were disciplinary investigations which is a different process.

The case was then dismissed in court.  We asked were there any more instances.  This letter does not answer the question.  It talks about disciplinary processes.  My point is that there is no candour here in terms of giving the responses to the questions that have been asked.<\/p> <p>  More importantly, we asked about the related policy and practice in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for dealing with suspected fraud relating to sick leave and the details of it.  The response noted that instances of non-compliance with sick leave regulations and falsification of records are reported to human resources.  It states the Civil Service disciplinary code may be invoked for serious misconduct.  In the case we raised initially, that did not happen.  Why?  That is the point.  In this case, the Garda seems to have bypassed its own processes and went straight to an arrest.<\/p><p>What we know is that the garda&iacute; who arrested this individual were known to her.  That was an issue as well.  There are issues with process here.  It may well be that they are not for this committee to discuss - I do not know - but they came up in the course of an appearance of the Garda Commissioner before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We need to go back to the Commissioner and get clearer answers to the questions we put.  The obvious ones concern the exit surveys, which I have cited.  Can he be clearer that there was only one case, as it seems there was, that led to a criminal investigation?  That should be very easy for him to respond to.

The committee subsequently received a letter stating that there was an error in his response to us.  Whether he was before this committee or whether the information was given by way of correspondence, that certainly happened.  Obviously, the Commissioner did not get the correct information internally from the people who were advising him.  It strikes me - and this may not be a matter for this committee to discuss - that to carry out an exit survey with one's immediate supervisor is not the way to go.  We certainly have to ask about the process used in this regard.  If there is to be a change in culture, we have to make it possible for people to be honest and frank in exit surveys.  That seems very obvious.  If something is subject to a criminal investigation, the committee would have no business having a discussion about it, but we need to know if that is the case.<\/p> <p>  Garda&iacute; are involved in a very dangerous job and some of them will be out on sick leave.  One would expect to see that.  Let us say there are allegations that there are a small number who have altered medical certificates.  Would the various allowances apply while they are out sick?  It is not at all clear what that would have amounted to in terms of the payments individuals have received.  In the Civil Service people are paid a certain amount, but with certain other grades, such as garda, soldier or whatever, very often allowances make up a large proportion of their income.  It would be useful to find out if people on sick pay lose their allowances.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane is right about separating out the reasons a disciplinary code would be used, when it is used and when matters go beyond the code.  That is not clear from this correspondence.

This is simple.  Exit surveys should not be carried out if one is not going to learn from them.  The whole point of an exit survey is to learn from it.  A simple answer here would have been very helpful to us.  We asked a very simple question, namely, whether bullying and harassment were recorded in the exit survey.  Instead of responding that the Garda has a system in place and its analysis found that bullying and harassment did not come up, the response was that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had no record of any person citing bullying.  That is not an answer to our question.  The next question we asked was very simple, namely, whether anyone had been arrested in respect of fraud.  The answer should have been \"Yes\" or \"No\" and in the case of \"Yes\", the number of arrests should have been given.  These are simple questions, so it is not reassuring to the Committee of Public Accounts to receive such answers.  Only two weeks ago, we had Garda representatives before us with their transformational presentation on their organisation and the justice committee.  We want to believe them.

There was a value-for-money element to it because there was an allegation at the time that due process was not followed.  That led to a criminal investigation that cost the State money.  It went to court and the charges were dismissed.  Leaving aside that case, I have no problem with individuals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are falsifying records for the purpose of defrauding the State and the system being dealt with.  Of course they should be dealt with.  Nobody on this committee would stand over anything else.  The question, however, is what processes are in place to determine that.  When it is an issue of sick leave, it should be dealt with first by human resources and then the other systems, the disciplinary code and so on, kick in.  That is the procedure to be followed.  The point is that in this case that procedure does not seem to have been followed and there were a lot of question marks over the nature of the arrest and so on, all leading to the case collapsing in court.<\/p> <p>  There is, however, a more fundamental point, which Deputies Connolly and Catherine Murphy touched on, about the exit surveys.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na says there is no record of bullying being cited, but we need to know whether that statement is factual, in other words, whether it is based on the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have an organisational record or whether it has actually carried out the trawl.  There is a difference.  It would not be factually right to say there is no record.  There may be no records held, but that does not mean that in a local Garda station somewhere, when garda&iacute; start to go through any exit surveys, there would not be a record of bullying.  If there is a number of records in one particular Garda station, that would create a problem because there could be a culture, which is what we were trying to establish.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy's point about the independence of exit surveys is also important.  I do not think that is a matter for our committee, however, and perhaps we should refer it to the justice committee.  We should send our follow-up questions.

If it does not have a policy, it could not have said there is no record.  We will, therefore, ask the Commissioner whether he will put a policy in place.

They have nothing to do with HR.  If someone in the Garda believes fraud has been committed by another member of the Garda, the matter goes straight to a fraud investigation.  The letter further notes that instances of non-compliance with sick leave regulations are reported to HR.  Someone came to the conclusion that there was a suspected case of fraud here, but HR does not follow up on fraud.  HR can do what it likes, but if the Garda suspects fraud, it must follow it up on a criminal basis.  These are two different, unconnected tracks.  One can follow the other, though it does not have to.  I have seen cases over the years of garda&iacute; being prosecuted for allegedly taking &euro;200 or &euro;300 out of a station from money handed in for gun licences.  That is suspected fraud, which goes straight to a criminal investigation.  That does not only go to HR, because if the Garda believes there is fraud it goes off on that track.  That is the Garda's job.  It has a second role as an employer and HR comes into that.

There is a complete distinction between suspected fraud and instances of non-compliance with procedures.  Suspected fraud cases mean a potential loss to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as money would be paid out in a fraudulent manner.  Fraud is a criminal issue, not a HR issue.  Do members understand the distinction I am making?  I am not trying to muddy the waters, but rather trying to clarify.  We will go back to what the Deputy said.  I am not asking everyone to agree with me, but I see two different issues going on here which are independent of each other.  One does not follow the other.  I accept that this particular case was dismissed and was probably thrown out of court.  However, I can see why, if the Garda believes that one of its members is involved in suspected fraud, it would be a straightforward criminal matter rather than a HR matter.  I am just making that observation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#H00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I do not think the Chairman is muddying the waters at all.

The allegations in these three cases apparently related to altering medical certificates and did not get to the point of fraud, it would seem.  We asked about suspected fraud and arrests but the letter talks about the disciplinary procedures.  In this case, I imagine that it should have gone through the disciplinary procedures, where any errors would have been captured, rather than going straight to an arrest and a court proceeding.  There are a number of different steps in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#H00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We will send the transcript of this discussion to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to give it a precise understanding of the issues raised.

We will publish this letter, redacting the name of the person concerned.  That is noted and published with redaction.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2450B is from Mr. Tom Doherty, chief operations officer of Teagasc, providing an information note requested by the committee about the number of contracts that were non-compliant with procurement rules in 2018.  These were recorded in the statements of internal control or governance in its annual report.  This committee now has a policy of immediately writing to an organisation for a detailed explanation, which can be put on the public record, whenever we meet instances of non-compliance with public procurement.  Public bodies will likely not want their details read out to that extent in future and so it will probably encourage them to deal with the issue and not let it recur.  The letter from Teagasc provides considerable details, much of them relating to the rollover of a Vodafone telephone account.  It seems to be dealing with the issues.  We will note and publish the letter.  Our point is well made on that particular issue.  Public bodies will have to give a detailed point-by-point full explanation of the issue, the action taken, the value involved and the remedial action taken.  They will not want to be written to again next year.  Let us hope they act accordingly.  We will note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2453B is from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  It provides information requested by the committee on the general indemnity scheme and clinical indemnity scheme, details of the type of cover provided and information regarding which legal costs are covered or not covered.  This is a follow-up inquiry for the purposes of our periodic report.  We have asked for details where we felt there were gaps in our information.  We will note and publish that letter, which will feed into our periodic report.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2454B is from Mr. Michael Goodwin from the energy security division of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It provides an information note on the National Oil Reserves Agency levy and its potential repurposing for use by the climate action fund, which will require legislation.  Deputy MacSharry previously raised this issue.  The Department states that legislation is required to achieve this goal.  It also clarifies, in response to the Deputy's question from a previous meeting, that it is not in a position to hand over the surplus in its accounts to the Government by way of a dividend.  It accepts that the levy is in excess of what it requires and it now wants it to be used for the climate action fund, which is Government policy.  The Government has published the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill, which will provide for the surplus levies collected to be used for the climate action fund.  The letter goes on to say that legislation is currently being developed to amend the 2007 legislation and provide for the expansion of the purpose of future levy funds.  The letter has not answered the central question we asked about the existing build-up of funds, though we understand that future levies can have a new purpose based in the legislation.  This question will probably be debated in the Chamber during the passage of the legislation, whenever that happens.  The letter sets out the Department's position crystal clear.  We will note and publish this item.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#H00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>We need the Department to set it out crystal clear, because I did so two weeks ago.

We will not get the benefit of that &euro;250 million unless the Government stops levying the agency for a period and works down the funds.

This is a school transport issue, which was raised at a Committee of Public Accounts meeting on 28 Feb 2013.

He was very concerned and wanted to verify that Bus &Eacute;ireann was not using these funds for any purposes other than school transport.<\/p><p>The then Chairman, Deputy McGuinness, reiterated the same point.  I think many people sought clarification on it.

As a member of the committee at that time, Deputy Donohoe wanted verification that this was the actual situation.

It relates to communication with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability services.  The association is looking for all-party support for a number of issues, including the lifting of the limitation period in the context of all thalidomide survivors, an acknowledgement of wrongdoing by the State and recompense for survivors.  While we are all sympathetic and we all support the principle the association is talking about, it is not a matter with which the Committee of Public Accounts can deal specifically.  It has been referred to the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State for them to deal with it.  I suggest that we note this correspondence.  This is really a matter to be dealt with in the Chamber.  Members can show their support for this cause by asking parliamentary questions and raising it in the Chamber, but the Committee of Public Accounts cannot take it on.  Any change in the legislation in this area is a policy issue.  Any time limitations on the taking of cases are policy issues.  We will note the correspondence.

The correspondence refers particularly to resources for students with special needs.  It lists a number of findings and recommendations in relation to whole-school evaluations.  It suggests that the Department of Education and Skills has failed to deal with the educational matters raised.  In my view, this is a matter of public funds allocated for special education purposes.  It is alleged in the letter that funds are being used for school administration and other purposes.  If this means that money being allocated for special needs purposes is not being used for those purposes, the Committee of Public Accounts will want to know why funding being allocated to a vulnerable group is possibly being used for other purposes in the school.  I do not know whether it is.  I met the correspondent in person outside a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago.

An audit has to be done.  I do not know whether any audit is done in a school.  I am just not sure.  I am not suggesting that 4,000 audits have to be done in all the schools in Ireland.  I think there should be an annual return from the board of management of each school, showing how the money received from the Department under various headings has been utilised.

That body has not been before this committee yet but it is a fundamental part of the national children's hospital project.<\/p> <p>  We have suggested a meeting with Pobal for 12 December.  Last week we agreed to have a meeting on the carbon fund, fossil fuel levy and so on.  The CSO has produced a report and the Comptroller and Auditor General has a chapter in his report on this issue.  We know that well over &euro;3 billion has been collected and the Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended that Departments be required to show how the money that has been collected under the name of the carbon fund has been utilised.  The CSO has reported on this and the ESRI has produced two reports on it which have been circulated to members.  One of the ESRI reports, published in October, provides a breakdown of the headings under the carbon fund.  We will not have a big discussion on it now but I am proposing that as the aforementioned two independent organisations have done much work on the carbon tax collected and how it has been spent, I propose one or possibly two meetings on this issue.  At one of the meetings we will talk to the CSO and the ESRI because they are independent of the Department and have done great work on this.  We are not going to redo any of their work but it would be very helpful for the public if we have a public discussion on the carbon fund.  There is a lack of transparency and the CSO and ESRI have done much work to try to get behind it and have commented on how the funds collected have been used and whether the spending has been detrimental or useful in terms of reducing our carbon emissions.  Obviously, we will invite representatives from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment a fortnight later.  We do not have confirmation from these organisations but we will ask the secretariat in November to make the necessary arrangements.  We will try to make sure the meetings are not too long because people are under pressure.  We should be able to do a nice piece of very important work on the carbon fund in terms of taxes collected and their use, in two meetings.  We will confine it to two meetings - one with the CSO and ESRI and the other with the Department.  It will be helpful to the public.  This is 100% under the remit of this committee.  Taxes have been collected for a specific purpose and we want to see how they were utilised in the context of environmental issues.  It is 100% under our remit.

Caranua is responsible for overseeing the use of substantial funds pledged by a number of religious congregations to support the needs of survivors of residential institutional child abuse.  The Act provides that the funds received from the religious congregations were to be used to pay grants to survivors in order that they may avail of approved services.  The types of approved services for which grant funding is available are housing support services, health and well-being services and education, learning and development services.  The Act also permits the use of the fund to pay for expenditure incurred by Caranua in the performance of its functions.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements for Caranua before the committee today relate to the financial year 2017.  At December 2017, cash contributions amounting to &euro;101 million had been received into the fund.  Interest earned on deposits amounted to &euro;321,000.  As at 31 December 2017, the status of the amounts received was as follows: &euro;66.8 million had been paid out by way of grants to survivors of residential institutional child abuse; &euro;7.6 million had been used to fund Caranua&rsquo;s administration costs and there was a net balance of &euro;26.9 million remaining in the fund.  Caranua&rsquo;s expenditure in 2017 totalled just over &euro;17 million.  Almost &euro;15 million was expended in respect of grants to survivors.  This included &euro;10.7 million on housing-related grants and &euro;3.7 million on health-related grants.  Administration expenditure charged to the fund in 2017 amounted to &euro;2.06 million.<\/p> <p>  My audit report in respect of Caranua&rsquo;s financial statements for 2017 draws attention to the statement on internal control, which discloses weaknesses in the board&rsquo;s control over grant payments, which created a risk that in some cases grant expenditure might not be used for the purposes intended.  During the audit of the 2017 financial statements, sample-based examination of the controls over grant payments found that: evidence was not available in respect of 56% of the sample cases examined that required pricing quotations were received by the board in advance of grant payment; evidence was not available in respect of around 50% of the sample grants examined that required invoices and receipts had been presented following payment of grants and; evidence was not available in respect of 55% of a sample of housing support grants examined that claimants had provided the required proof of property tenancy or ownership.  These grant control findings are similar to those of previous years&rsquo; audits, to which I had also drawn attention.  The statement on internal control sets out the steps being taken by the board to resolve the control weaknesses identified.  Fieldwork on the audit of Caranua&rsquo;s draft 2018 financial statements has been completed.  I expect that the financial statements will be certified in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571299200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for giving Caranua the opportunity to come before it today to discuss the 2017 financial statements.  Caranua was established in 2013 as the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012.  Caranua is responsible for the management of a limited fund to improve the quality of life of people who, as children, experienced abuse and neglect in institutions and who have received an award or settlement as referred to in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.  To date, &euro;106.9 million has been received from the religious congregations and an additional &euro;1.38 million in interest.  There is just over &euro;3 million outstanding in contributions, which is expected to be received in full by December 2019.<\/p> <p>  Caranua commenced accepting applications in January 2014.  Since then, Caranua has received applications from 6,543 people.  Of these, 5,987 were survivors who were eligible to apply for funding supports.  By the end of September 2019, Caranua had made over 54,000 funding supports payments to the value of &euro;91.3 million.  At 30 September, the highest area of provision of funding supports was home improvements at &euro;65.1 million, followed by health at &euro;24.5 million, education at &euro;1.4 million and exceptional needs support at &euro;0.28 million.  In carrying out its function, Caranua has tried to distribute the fund provided in the fairest way possible to all eligible survivors.  The legislation sets out that all operational costs must be met from the fund.  To the end of September, &euro;11.5 million has been spent on operations.  The board of Caranua and management have worked determinedly to minimise operational costs and continue to do so during the wind-down phase.<\/p> <p>  As part of enhanced reporting, we have improved our accountability and transparency through our monthly updates on our website.  Our website has information on board minutes, monthly updates on applications and spend, information on complaints and feedback from survivors and other news items are published regularly.  Caranua has to strike a balance between working with survivors in a person-centred and compassionate manner and our obligations as a public body with regards to our fiduciary responsibilities.  While at times the process can be seen by some survivors as too bureaucratic, it has been necessary for Caranua to respond to the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  Following recommendations of the 2017 audit, we invested a lot of time reviewing and improving our internal policies and procedures, aiming to combat the issues raised, while still focusing on delivering an accessible and person-centred service for survivors.  Since the beginning of 2018, our internal controls are reviewed at every board meeting and actions are implemented and updated at the following meeting.  Our risk register is also reviewed at every audit and risk committee meeting and updates are provided at each board meeting.  Since December 2018, Caranua has been at 100% compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The board of Caranua has established a wind-down committee to manage the orderly wind-down of Caranua.  This committee met the representative of the Department of Education and Skills tasked with drafting the wind-down legislation required.  The committee will continue to engage with the Department.<\/p> <p>  In order to combat discrepancies between the confidential payment system and the case management system, a complete change of practice was undertaken in 2018.  Monthly reconciliations are now undertaken and a full report from 2018 shows the two systems are now fully reconciled.  Public procurement guidelines are complied with in all instances of purchasing goods and services since 2018.  For purchases prior to 2018, where the guidelines were not complied with or documentation was not retained, we have undertaken a process of market testing to ensure value for money.  As Caranua is currently in wind-down, a decision was made not to re-tender for the existing suppliers.  Since September 2018, we have introduced purchase requisition order documents.  Evidence of tax clearance certificates are now obtained for all relevant suppliers.  On travel and subsistence claims, supporting documentation is obtained for all claims made.  The rate of subsistence for staff is in line with Government circulars.<\/p> <p>  On prepayment documents, a simplified acceptable quotations document is provided to survivors so they are aware in advance of the standard of quotation required for audit purposes.  We have also introduced additional internal checks to ensure the paperwork is of the required standard prior to payment.  We implemented a best effort approach with regard to post-payment requirements.  During the course of their application, the application advisers ask that survivors send in their receipts for all funding supports received.  In addition, we wrote to survivors requesting return of any outstanding receipts from 2018.  Caranua has received 66% of receipts from funding supports made during 2018.  While this may seem like a straightforward task, receiving the letters was upsetting for some survivors as they felt we did not trust them, which was not the case at all.  It can be a challenge to meet both the needs of survivors and the audit recommendations.<\/p> <p>  Our 2018 audited accounts are currently with the Comptroller and Auditor General and we hope to have them finalised in the coming weeks.  As Caranua operates with a limited fund, which is now nearly expended, we are nearing the end of our remit and are currently in the process of winding down the organisation.  On 31 May 2018, the board of Caranua announced the decision to cease taking new or repeat applications from 1 August 2018.  As legislation prevents Caranua from making first contact with survivors, we were dependent on raising awareness of the cessation date through a variety of methods, including outreach events, poster campaigns, media advertising, word of mouth and working with survivor support and other stakeholder groups.<\/p><p>As a result of this work, Caranua received 289 applications between 1 May and 1 August 2018.  After 2 August 2018, Caranua received 378 applications.  Except for in exceptional circumstances, Caranua has not provided funding supports to these survivors, but we have offered advocacy supports and some survivors have availed of them.  In the past 18 months, Caranua has adopted a targeted approach to outreach events by focusing on a number of specific survivor groups, including survivors who required additional supports in managing their applications and those who had received limited or no funding supports.  This targeted approach has proven to have excellent results, as survivors are provided with an opportunity to discuss their applications in person with their application advisers.<\/p><p> I will outline some examples of our outreach work.  More than 100 survivors have opted to come to Caranua's offices for meetings with their application advisers.  Outreach days have been organised in conjunction with the Christine Buckley Centre for Education and Support, Right of Place, the Cork Deaf Association and in the UK with the C&aacute;irde survivors group, the Coventry Irish Society and the Disabled Survivors Support Network.  Caranua commenced a programme of outreach for survivors in prisons across Ireland.  In addition, 2019 marked the 20th anniversary of the State apology to survivors and the tenth anniversary of the publication of the Ryan report.  I was delighted that the Christine Buckley Centre for Education and Support invited Caranua, along other survivor support and counselling services, to join the organising committee to plan two events to mark the anniversaries.  We organised a conference, Facing the future together - Ireland's lifelong responsibility to the survivors of institutional abuse, on 11 May in Trinity College.  In the afternoon, a celebration event was held for survivors.<\/p><p> Through our work, we have found that social isolation is an issue for a number of survivors.  Many survivors contact Caranua on a regular basis for a chat as this communication is the only social contact they have.  Survivors outside of Ireland often mention that Caranua is their only link with Ireland.  We aim to assist survivors by linking them with survivor support groups and other organisations that may be able to offer support and befriending services in the longer term.<\/p><p> While working in Caranua, I have had the privilege of meeting and working with some of the most resilient and empowered survivors and I have also met survivors who are still very much impacted by their childhood experiences who will require supports for the foreseeable future.  Caranua will continue to work in support of survivors until our closure.  I thank the Chairperson and the members for their attention.  We are happy to answer any questions that the committee may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachel Downes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Downes.

That would be a travesty when the process is over.  We have had many difficulties with Caranua.  We do not want a situation where there are 200 people we can do nothing for.  It is an issue that will not go away.

These are just small points.<\/p> <p>  My next two points are more for the Department of Education and Skills.  From what I have heard here as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Caranua was set up without adequate resources and an adequate estimate of what was involved and as soon as it was established, it was snowed under with regard to the number of staff processing applications never mind doing the work it would have liked to have done and with which it is probably dealing.  Who in the Department of Education and Skills advised on what was necessary to set up this organisation?  I have been critical of the Department.  Whoever did it failed to properly estimate the work rate as evidenced by everything we have seen with Caranua.  It has been said year after year when Caranua has been in front of the committee that it is snowed under.  The matter is broader than the Department of Education and Skills.  The Committee of Public Accounts found the same thing in another Department that set up the Tax Appeals Commission.  It did not set it up.  We have seen how when setting up new agencies, Departments get it woefully wrong in terms of estimating the work, staffing, resources and workload.  I have cited two examples.  There is a lesson for the public service, which is why we are the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not just directing it at the Department of Education and Skills.  I am sure that if I worked my way through some other new agencies that were set up in recent years, it might be the same.  I do not want to personalise it but Departments consistently undersell and underestimate the problem.  It is probably easier to convince us in the Oireachtas and Ministers that something is a small thing and that it will be easy to get it through and will not require much funds.  If they got a fuller picture, we might have been better off and Caranua might have been better resourced from day one and might have provided a better service.  The fact that it did not get adequate resources was not its fault.  I put it back to the parent Department, although it is not unique to that Department.  Other Departments make this mistake.  It is systemic.  We saw it this morning with a different item about a post-project review relating to a cinema in Galway that involved the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Again, mistakes were made involving overruns and underestimating.  They talked about training within the section within the Department.  This happens across the board in the public service.  We need learning across the board instead of pigeonholing it and putting into the particular box where the problem arose.  Some Department will set up some other new agency next year or the following year and I advise it to look at the mistakes that other Departments have made in setting up new agencies.  Sitting here for the past three years, I see no evidence yet of an organisation being set up properly.  Perhaps I am being a bit severe.  It is not directed at the witnesses.

It would be remiss of me not to put this on the public record.  As Chairman of this committee, I point out that we have been on this case with the Department for the last couple of years.  This issue has been going on for 17 years at this stage and there appeared to be a lack of drive in terms of getting it over the line, but we have seen a considerable effort being made in the past year or two.  We have been getting quarterly reports on it.  In case the people watching are wondering if it all vanished into thin air, I want to put this information on the record and would ask the witnesses to comment.  I will read from the aforementioned letter because it is important for the public to see that the Department has been following this well.<\/p> <p>  Properties are being transferred in respect of the 2002 indemnity agreement, as are those offered voluntarily by congregations under the 2009 agreement.  Since the last quarterly report, a number of transfers have been completed.  The former primary school at Westport in County Mayo has been completely transferred, and the transfer of St. Anne's, Lenaboy, in Galway, and of lands at Cahir, County Tipperary, have also been completed.  Three properties have yet to be dealt with and are referred to in this report.  One is at Ballyjamesduff involving the Sisters of Saint Clare.  The note on this says that the Chief State Solicitor's office is awaiting closing documents from the congregation's solicitor prior to the transfer being in a position to be completed.  Communication is ongoing between both solicitors and transfer is expected to be completed shortly.  That transfer is earmarked for the end of this year and it is hoped it will be included in the report early next year.  Do the witnesses want to add anything to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#QQ00100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571299200,"counter":1383,"content":"<p>In terms of the 2002 agreement overall, 58 out of the 60 have fully transferred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife Conduit"},{"type":"speech","time":1571299200,"counter":1384,"content":"<p>That is great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019101700002#QQ00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571299200,"counter":1385,"content":"<p>One of them is very near completion.

It is a great privilege and opportunity for us to make a presentation on the issue of education and to answer any questions members may have.  I am the CEO of Plan International Ireland and a member of the D&oacute;chas board.<\/p> <p>  Inequality is reaching new extremes.  Significant increases in inequality of both income and wealth are leading to larger gaps between the rich and poor and men and women.  This is creating serious obstacles to overcoming poverty and exclusion, and stopping us creating a more equal, peaceful and sustainable world.  With women and girls over-represented in the rank of the poorest, this is also reinforcing gender inequality and blocking progress for women and human rights.  In most countries, children born into rich families will go to the best possible schools and are very often privately educated.  They will have small class sizes and well trained teachers and will get good results in state examinations.  These students will have multiple opportunities to grow their inherited opportunities.  Girls and boys born into poverty, suffering from ill health and malnutrition, arrive at the school gates already disadvantaged, if they arrive there at all.  They will then struggle with overcrowded facilities that lack trained and qualified teachers, textbooks and toilets.  Inequalities of income are compounded with other inequalities of gender, ethnicity, disability and geography, therefore exacerbating exclusion.  Pulled out of schools before their brothers, millions more of the world&rsquo;s poorest girls will continue to have their life chances hindered by an education that is all too brief.<\/p> <p>  The barriers to girls participating in and completing education are wide-ranging and intersectional.  They include high rates of child and early forced marriage, early pregnancy and lack of information on and access to sexual reproductive health and rights services, school-related gender-based violence and harmful gender norms which result in discriminatory curricula, textbooks, pedagogy and educational policies.  This has a significant impact on girls&rsquo; ability to complete their basic education, both primary and secondary, and to be able to participate in the labour force, have their views heard and access positions of power.  On the other hand, good-quality public education for all can be a powerful engine for greater equality.  Beyond boosting incomes, good education is an engine for equality in other important ways.  I refer, for example, to the fact that it reduces poverty.  This is because a good education makes the likelihood of higher incomes and lower poverty much greater.  It boosts opportunity for all with the possibility for children from poor families to end up better off than their parents.  It brings society together as schools can be places where the barriers of inequality are broken down.  This will give young people the tools to go into the world and build more equitable societies.  It supports democratic societies.  Education offers individuals the tools to exercise their right to an equal say in respect of the structures and policies that govern their lives, which boosts democracy.  It promotes stability and peace in a time of crisis.  Education in emergencies and protracted crisis breaks the cycle of hopelessness, frustration and anger.  It offers protection and provides a visible sign of normality for children, particularly in camp situations.<\/p> <p>  Good education has considerable power to increase equality between women and men.  Education can help tackle gender disparities in wages, poverty, reproductive autonomy and political power.  It can dramatically improve outcomes for women and their children.  The more educated girls are, the more power they will have over their lives, particularly over when they marry and how many children they have.  If all girls in sub-Saharan Africa and south-west Asia completed secondary education, there would be a 64% drop in child marriages.  I also heard recently that if one could keep girls in education up to the age of 18 years, one would eliminate child marriage almost overnight.  These are significant gains.  The more educated mothers are, the healthier they and their children are.  It has been estimated that if all girls completed primary education, there would be a 66% reduction in maternal deaths and a 15% reduction in child deaths.  Good quality education has the power to challenge traditional social attitudes and ensure that girls and boys know that they are equal.<\/p> <p>  Plan International Ireland fully endorses the submission from D&oacute;chas with which we are actively working to promote the right to free, public and high-quality education for all.  After a number of years in which education was not prioritised in Ireland&rsquo;s overseas aid policy, the commitment to spend at least &euro;250 million over the next five years, as noted in the new policy for international development, A Better World, and the recent pledge at the United Nations General Assembly to support education in emergencies with &euro;6.5 million for the organisation Education Cannot Wait in 2019, are positive signs that education is back as Ireland&rsquo;s priority.  We warmly welcome the acknowledgement of education as a priority in A Better World and the recommendation to increase funding for education, especially girls&rsquo; education, by this committee.  However, this should not be the end, but the beginning.<\/p> <p>  We must talk about Brexit at this time.  In a post-Brexit scenario there is an opportunity for Ireland.  With the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU leaving a leadership gap in the context of education, Ireland can seek to fill this leadership role by promoting the importance of investing in education for global development and stability, in line with our own experience.  Ireland is a clear example of the positive impact investment in universal education can have on a country&rsquo;s economic and social development.  As a European leader on education, Ireland could join Canada in the push for education for all, especially girls, by driving the promotion of gender transformative education as key in realising progress in fighting inequality.  Investing in gender transformative education is vital to breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty.  Gender transformative education seeks to explicitly challenge and eliminate gender bias and discrimination not only in the classroom, but in society more broadly.<\/p> <p>  We are here to seek the committee&rsquo;s support for the education sector in overseas aid, particularly the education of girls and the many benefits this will bring.  We also encourage a focus on those who are furthest behind in order that we can we reach them first and seek to ensure that Government funding goes to public education services rather than the private sector.  These points will be outlined in more detail by my colleagues.<\/p><p>Again, I thank the committee for the invitation to today's meeting and look forward to answering any questions members may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1430,"content":"<p>I now invite Sr. Brigid Tunney to make her contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#C00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1431,"content":"<p>I am a Loreto sister and my congregation is a member of Misean Cara.  I would like to give the committee an insight into some of our work and experience with girls' education in South Sudan.<\/p><blockquote>To educate girls is to reduce poverty.  Study after study has taught us that there is no tool for development more effective than the education of girls and the empowerment of women.<\/blockquote> <p>These are the words of Mr. Kofi Annan from April 2003.  South Sudan has been at war for 45 of the last 65 years.  As a result, development in the country has been stifled and infrastructure is very poor.  Four million people are displaced and another six million depend on food aid in order to survive.  According to UNESCO, over 2.2 million children of schoolgoing age were out of school in 2015.  More than half of secondary school aged children were out of school, with the rates reaching 75% for girls in rural areas.<br\/><br\/>As in many cultures in Africa, the payment of a dowry or bride price is common practice in South Sudan.  Daughters are thus seen as a source of wealth for the family.  Upon getting married, girls leave their birth family and become part of their husband&rsquo;s family so investing in a girl&rsquo;s future is seen as a waste of resources.  The thinking is that it is better to marry a girl off quickly to bring the dowry in to the family.  As a result, child marriage is common.  A girl of 15 in South Sudan is more likely to be married with children than to be in school.  Girls are taken from the classroom from as early as 11 years old to be married off.  Keeping girls in school to complete their primary and secondary school education is a constant battle.<br\/><br\/>Following on a long tradition of Irish missionary education in developing countries, the Loreto girls&rsquo; secondary school in Maker Kuei, Rumbek, South Sudan opened in 2008 with 35 girls.  Today the school has an enrolment of 291.  It is a boarding school, providing a secure and safe environment for the girls to pursue their education.  When the girls are within the compound, the risk of violence, rape and forced marriage is reduced.  As I have said, keeping the girls in school is the most significant challenge.  In 2011, the drop-out rate from the school was a very discouraging 68%.  We decided to exploit the power of male family members to achieve our goal of full retention in education for our students.  After much discussion, planning and negotiation, we introduced what we call a commitment form.  This document is signed by a male family member and commits the family to ensuring that the girl in question completes the four years of the secondary cycle.  No girl is admitted to the school without a signed commitment form and it is working.  In 2018, the drop-out rate had fallen to 1.4%.  <br\/><br\/>As I mentioned, this is a constant battle.  At Christmas in 2018, two of our students did not want to go home for the holidays because they were certain they would be kept at home and married off against their will.  In fact, cattle had already been given for one of the girls.  Both girls opted to remain in the school compound instead.  The heads of the two families were not happy with this but we managed to use the signed commitment forms to plead the girls&rsquo; cases.  On the basis of the forms, the local paramount chief managed to secure a ministerial order from the ministry of education endorsing the girls' right to remain in school.  This was a big step for us.  One of those girls is Mary, a first year student.  She had already been taken away twice by her family to be married off during the 2018 school year.  She was tied up and beaten but managed to escape and returned to the school.  At Christmas, we hid her in the convent until we had negotiated with her father that she could stay in school until she had completed her education.  Mary will not leave the compound for another two years.  She is quite restricted but she is happy to do this in order to get her education. <br\/><br\/>In the western world, the notion of a boarding school is generally associated with wealth and privilege but the Loreto boarding school in Rumbek creates a safe place for vulnerable girls to complete their education.  It is heavily subsidised by donations.  Another benefit of the school is the promotion of peace.  Peace is fragile in South Sudan.  When disagreements occur, violence is often the first rather than the last resort.  Revenge killing is common and the violence often breaks down along ethnic lines.  However, the girls in the boarding school come from different states and various ethnic groups and are learning that they can live together in peace.  The school&rsquo;s peace club and culture club play a part in this.  The girls learn about one another&lsquo;s cultures and the need for all to live in harmony if the people of South Sudan are to have a future.  <br\/><br\/>Misean Cara&rsquo;s members warmly welcomed this committee&rsquo;s February 2018 report on its review of the Irish Aid programme.  We welcomed, in particular, the recommendations that the Government examine opportunities to increase funding to missionary bodies and that it review and consider an increase in support for education, placing a particular emphasis on quality education and girls&rsquo; education.  The experience of the girls attending the Loreto school in Rumbek is a testimony to the power and impact of education on the individual and on society.  A full 90% of our graduates have gone on to third level education.  They are training in nursing and teaching, are employed with NGOs, in local radio and so on.  In a social media post for Women&rsquo;s Day 2017, one of those graduates, acknowledging the education received in Loreto Rumbek, wrote: <\/p><blockquote>I promise you that South Sudan will have great women because of you.  We are the source of strength and agents of change in our society.<\/blockquote> <p>These are words of hope for the fragile nation of South Sudan and particularly for the women of South Sudan.  These words confirm the importance of girls&rsquo; education in forwarding women&rsquo;s rights and in developing a new, emerging independent nation.  I thank the committee for its support of our work.  Long may that support continue and grow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Sr. Brigid Tunney"},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1432,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Anne O'Mahony, head of international programmes in Concern, to make her contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#C00400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1433,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak at this meeting.  One of the important issues in the context of a discussion on education is the need for a good quality education and I do not think any of us would be here today without having had the benefit of that.  When we send our children to school we also expect that they are going to be educated in a safe environment.  Data collected over many years have shown that school-related, gender-based violence has long-term impacts on the quality and uptake of education, particularly of girls, around the world.  We have had our own history of this in Ireland and in the countries that Concern works in, this is an everyday occurrence.  I worked in Kenya in 2011 and 2012.  There was a one inch column in the local newspaper, on about page 15, that said the teacher in a school in Kisumu had fathered 11 children in one year in that school.  It deserved and only got one column inch in the newspaper and nothing more, despite the impact of this on the girls' lives and future careers.  At that stage, Concern began to look at school-related, gender-based violence and has since developed what we call a safe learning model.<\/p><p>We are rolling that model out in some of the schools and other education sectors we are engaged in around the world.  We want to examine whether this model is working, and we have engaged with UCD to look at research relevant to how it is going to be tested and rolled out.  That is intended to produce evidence of the consequences of school-related gender-based violence, which occurs in the very place where we expect our children to be safe, nurtured, educated and come out ready for life.  <\/p><p> Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world and has a literacy rate of just 67% among those aged 15 to 24.  The country has suffered from war, but since that has ended there has been a major increase in registration in primary schools.  Research into how much had been learned during that education period, however, from an early grade reading assessment, EGRA, found that little had been learned by those children.  Delving deeper into the research revealed many links to the education environment not being a safe space, particularly for girls.  <\/p><p> One of the themes we are raising is the situation of girls, not just in the school but in the home and community as well.  I refer to following through where violence occurs and examining the impact and outcome.  Our programming revolves very much around creating those safe spaces within the home, the community and the school.  We are engaging with UCD to determine how we can test and gauge this model.  I think that it is going to yield good results, not just for Concern but for D&oacute;chas members in general.  We would hope to be able to roll it out then globally, and observe the cost, the effect and, more important, ways in which we can address and deal with school-related gender-based violence in the future.  We are also seeking evidence that dealing with such violence in schools and communities before it becomes an issue can have a long-term impact on lives and education outcomes.  We hope that will be especially the case for girls and that it will allow them to take their place in the world which we would expect them to, given their level of education and the time commitment parents put into keeping their children in school over a lifetime.<\/p><p> A key request from us, and this links in with what Mr. O'Brien and Ms Tunney said earlier, in respect of the committee is that there be continued investment in a holistic approach to education which focuses on access, quality and especially on well-being, particularly in respect of girls' education.  That is the future of not just the countries we work in, but of the world more broadly.  We saw that in the video from Plan Ireland International earlier.  Another important aspect is the prioritisation of supporting the education system of the poorest and most vulnerable countries to ensure those furthest behind are reached first.  There should also be investment in more comprehensive research and data collection so we can better understand what needs to be done to address the issue of school-related gender-based violence.  <\/p><p> Years ago, we would have thought that the argument for long-term quality investment in education had been made.  We are still fighting that battle, however, at every forum to try to get the required continued investment.  That is not just in the education sector, but in the creation of safe spaces where people can and should be learning to improve the quality of their life outcomes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1435,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Mahony.

In recent decades, neoliberal economic policies, championed by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the World Bank, have constrained state funding for public services.  This has often triggered crises in provision, quality and access, which has undermined the realisation of rights, particularly in the global south.  Indeed, ActionAid&rsquo;s forthcoming research across 56 countries will show how IMF conditions and policy advice, especially on public sector wages, continue to undermine the investment in public services needed to achieve the SDGs.  The crises in public financing, together with a belief that the private sector provides greater \"efficiency\" and cost-effectiveness, have been used to justify dismantling universal public services and handing them over to private providers or supporting public-private partnerships, PPP.<\/p> <p>  One consequence is often increasingly unequal provision, which exacerbates the exclusion of women and girls given their vastly unequal responsibility for unpaid care and domestic work.  That is particularly the case where user fees are charged.  Even under a PPP providing for services free at the point of use, the costs and risks to the public purse are often high, transparency and accountability are usually low, and human rights violations are often exacerbated.  As NGOs committed to a human rights-based approach, we recognise basic needs as basic rights and oppose all forms of exclusion and discrimination.  We regard strengthening the accountable provision of quality, universal and gender-responsive public services, financed through systems of progressive taxation, as central to the equitable fulfilment of rights.  We consider privatisation and PPPs as fundamental human rights issues.<\/p> <p>  We believe it is illogical to expect that the private sector, with a mandate to generate maximum profit and increase shareholder wealth, will take responsibility for delivering quality public services and basic rights to all people, including those living in poverty.  Yet this perspective, which has been long held by international financial institutions such as the IMF, World Bank and the Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development, OECD, is also evident in many discussions concerning the financing and implementation of the SDGs.  It is also increasingly influential among some bilateral donors.  I heard about an example in Ethiopia from some of my colleagues last week.  It concerned a private school which expelled students whose parents could no longer afford to pay the required fees.  Not only were they expelled from the private school, they were also not allowed to take any of their documentation with them, such as results from exams etc., making it impossible for them to continue their education at another school.<\/p> <p>  Our requests of governments in the north include refraining from proposing, supporting, endorsing or financing privatisation processes or PPPs in their home countries and abroad.  That encompasses the roles of those governments as donors, trading partners, shareholders of multilateral development banks and in international fora such as the United Nations and the Global Partnership for Education.  We also ask that those governments be explicit in word and deed about how privatisation and PPPs undermine human rights and, specifically, further marginalise vulnerable excluded women and girls by increasing violence and unpaid care and domestic work.  They also reinforce risky working conditions.  In addition, we ask governments to make explicit, global commitments to supporting public services.  These are the foundations for advancing progress on human rights and sustainable development and it is particularly important in ensuring that no one is left behind.  We equally encourage governments to abide by the newly-developed Abidjan Principles concerning the human rights obligations of states to provide public education and regulate private involvement in education.<\/p> <p>  ActionAid recently completed a study on the impact of privatisation on the right to education and it focused on seven countries, namely, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda.  I will supply a copy to the committee.  The report used the Abidjan Principle as a framework for analysis and clearly states that the overall impact of privatisation has been negative.  It encourages donors to support free, quality, public education for all and the development of a system-oriented approach to ensuring this is provided to the highest attainable quality for all children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Triona Pender"},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1437,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Pender.

Even though there were many disturbing elements, it was good to hear the positive actions under way because they can be built on.  I acknowledge the long-term role of Irish missionaries in setting up and establishing the importance of education.  That continues through their efforts and those of our very reputable NGOs working in this area.  It is great to see the emphasis on quality education.  I say that because so much of the focus of the SDGs was on numbers and reaching numbers in enrolment, participation and completion.<\/p><p> I have been very fortunate to visit schools in a number of African countries.  As a former teacher, I have come out asking myself what the kids are doing there apart from getting their daily meal.  It seems that that is really the only benefit they get.  With the best will in the world, nothing else was happening at the schools I visited.  As a result, it is great to see that quality education is key here.  The question comes down to the fact that to have quality education, one must have qualified teachers who know what they are doing.  Do any of our guests see any improvement in the provision of properly certified teacher education?  Our training colleges are very good.  I do not know whether there are connections with them that could be pursued.  That is the first matter.<\/p><p> This is about changing attitudes.  The best example of this came from one of our former ambassadors, Sinead Walsh, who worked with the President of Sierra Leone, offside and out of the public eye, to get him to agree to a project to educate pregnant girls and girls who have babies.  Perhaps we could get somebody in authority who could make the difference to agree to a particular form of education.  Sadly, these girls cannot sit state exams, but at least they are in school and getting an education.  I do not know whether there are any more such examples.  I think what Sr. Bridget has done is one example.  Misean Cara must have some great negotiating skills to get the men to sign those commitment forms.  There are probably lessons to be learned there.  Those are the kinds of things one builds up from.<\/p><p> The other matter I wish to raise relates to children with disabilities.  We saw some really good examples in this regard.  I think Sr. Mary was in Sierra Leone with deaf children.  Others were with children with leprosy and Down's syndrome and albino children, who have such a horrific time in Africa.  Another thing that strikes me - I do not know what our guests think about this - is that in some countries one sees ads for the school here, there and somewhere else and what they are offering but, again, unless there is state-sponsored quality education, it is very much hit-and-miss.  What Ms Pender said about private education was interesting.  I do not think Ireland can talk on that because we are still very supportive of divisions in education in the form of private education.<\/p><p> I thank our guests.  It has been very good having them here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#D00500","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1440,"content":"<p>Do any of our guests wish to comment on the Deputy's remarks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#E00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1441,"content":"<p>Yes.  I thank the Deputy.  She raised a lot of the challenges we face almost daily.  The issue of trained teachers is huge.  She asks whether there is progress.  There is but it is mixed.  I still visit schools in which the teachers are probably four or five years older than some of the students they are teaching and may themselves have completed only primary school.  I have visited other schools in which the government has been a lot more serious about training teachers and ensuring there is a standard, but sometimes it is a bit of a mixed bag.  It is very challenging to have female teachers in the rural areas, particularly as role models for girls going to school.  One will often find that the teachers who have been naughty or bold have been sent to the areas farthest away.  Rather than getting the best teachers, the students are probably getting the teachers who have misbehaved in other places.  The quality of teaching is a bit of a mixed bag as a result.  There is also the absence of female teachers in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  I totally agree with the point made about the language of quality and of inclusivity.  Plan International Ireland has been really trying to ensure that children with disabilities gain access.  One rarely sees children with disabilities in communities in sub-Saharan Africa because it is a shame to have a child with a disability.  Working with the parents, the communities and the teachers, it takes a lot of convincing to get them to bring those children to school, ensuring they have the right to access education.  Sometimes it may be a matter of ensuring there is a ramp at the school in order that the children can gain access.  Sometimes it is a matter of ensuring that there is a toilet which can take a wheelchair or a child with a disability.  Sometimes it is a matter of ensuring that one works with the teachers - we are doing that in various countries - in order that they can bring these children in and, rather than just showing them for having differences, showing that they have just the same ability as able-bodied children to access education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1442,"content":"<p>I will add just a little to that.  Mr. O'Brien is right: some progress is being made but there is a long way to go.  Until the governments of the countries in which we work begin to take seriously their responsibilities in delivering education for their populations, we will always have some of these hit-and-miss attitudes.  We work in places such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, where once the girls reach puberty and, as Mr. O'Brien mentioned, if there are no female teachers in the school, the girls cannot continue to go to school.  This immediately reinforces the stereotype of uneducated girls who are unavailable to take up positions that could be created and endorsed for them as they go through their careers.  We are starting at a huge disadvantage on that basis.  That whole thing needs to change substantially.<\/p> <p>  Some progress is being made in certain countries on attitude changes in keeping girls who are pregnant in school.  It requires quite an upscaling of advocacy, not just from the authorities at the top but also from communities themselves, to make it unacceptable within communities for girls to be taken out of school just because they are pregnant, going back to school only after the pregnancy has finished.  Until communities engage with this, it will not really change, so it is both a top-down and a bottom-up push to try to change attitudes.  We are using tools such as community conversations to engage with communities and to demand first of all protection for their children and, second, that if their children happen to be abused while they are in the school system or even of schoolgoing age, that does not mean the end of their lives and their education but rather that they can go back into education.  Steps are being taken on all these fronts, but the steps are very small and need to increase.  We need to continue to shine a light on these issues that particularly affect girls and people with disabilities because they are, as Mr. O'Brien said, hidden groups of people.  They are the people who are not getting any chances at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Mahoney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1443,"content":"<p>Speaking of the quality aspect, for Misean Cara there is definitely an emphasis on teacher training.  In some locations the missionaries are very involved in actively teaching the trainers or in ongoing education.  A lot of the time it is also a matter of trying to bring what are often the experiences of quality education in the missionary schools into system-strengthening through other schools.  This means engaging with departments, which are very much part of the public system, in bringing in curriculum development and professional teacher development, trying to bring in school leadership and improving those things.<\/p> <p>  Regarding access, as we have discussed, we are very keenly engaged with girls and people with disabilities.  In the context of the SDGs and Leave No One Behind, another group in situations such as that in South Sudan but also elsewhere is refugees and forcibly displaced persons.  We are trying to keep an eye especially on an increasing cohort of people who are being displaced or who are likely to be displaced through climate crisis.  Another key thing in which we are very involved is system-strengthening, including through advocacy by champions within the missionaries, but also through local authorities and tribal chiefs and trying to come up with social contracts, as Sr. Bridget mentioned.  At present, we are trying to see whether we can test that and roll it out in other contexts and other countries because it may not necessarily work.  We ask ourselves the question, if it was so successful there, could it be successful in other contexts?

Do they understand that there has to be a real step change in culture to try to address this issue?  Do the witnesses feel that their engagement with the representatives' organisations is just tokenism, even through the type of social contract that the witnesses outlined?  Are the people just tolerating the organisations or are they committed to a deep culture change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#F00200","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1446,"content":"<p>That is a very good question.  In South Sudan I would not think it is an issue for the President in terms of the very fragile peace agreement there.  I would say that he is totally focused on that.  It is more at a local level, where we are in the western lake states, that we got the ministerial decree to help us keep the girls in the school.  We have spent a lot of time building relationships.  It is the relationships with the chiefs, the sub-chiefs and the whole hierarchy that must be gone through.  I had a conversation with the paramount chief last year when we negotiated for these girls.  I asked him how seriously he was going to take it.  I explained that he was negotiating for us and I asked him if he really believed in it.  He sat smiling at me.  I said that he was an educated man.  He is educated, is a lawyer and has English.  Most people in his community would not have any education.  I believe that on his part he was doing this to favour us.  We have a school but we also have a clinic and we employ gardeners and so on.  We are very central to the community where we are.  We provide a lot for the local community.  Supporting us in this regard was his way of saying thanks.<\/p> <p>  South Sudan, however, is so far behind that I do not think they really recognise it, but we see the mothers changing.  Mothers are the ones who push for it.  Two weeks ago, 12 mothers came and wanted their daughters to be taken into the boarding school.  They knew that if the girls stayed much longer in the primary school, they would be taken away to be married.  They managed to get their husbands to sign the commitment form.  They want their daughters to complete their primary certificate, which very few of their mothers had managed to do because they were taken out of the primary school and married off.  We see a change in the mindset of the women.  They will advocate for their daughters and they might have some influence.  I agree with the Deputy that possibly it is a token.  South Sudan is just so far behind that I do not think it is an issue yet.  Many of the girls coming out from our school would be more educated than the Minister of Education in that state.  In that sense, sometimes we have to be careful.  The girls could be seen as a threat to the men.  We have to be careful how we tread, but at the same time we are ploughing another furrow.

We are using a protocol of behaviour change that is a scientific approach to get people to change their behaviours.  I will not go into the whole ins and outs of that but we sat with them and discussed why they did not want girls to go to school and why the local, community, and government leaders did not want that.  They said that they had bigger issues in the community such as drought and underdevelopment.  We did an analysis with them and they came to the realisation on their own that part of the reason they are so underdeveloped is because half of their population - the girls - are not in school.  When one brings it around and they come to the realisation on their own that a lot of the time they are contributing to this themselves by not educating girls, then there is buy-in from them.

The budget, however, is never enough.  We are pushing to get at least an allocation of 20% of the national budget to education, and it is not happening anywhere.  Without money the teachers cannot be paid properly and there cannot be a good school with all of the facilities needed for education.  I believe that we are getting there.  If we analyse the educational strategy plans across the board in the countries we work in, the majority of them are currently mainstreaming gender.  Whether this is actually applied is a big challenge.

I believe the MDGs got bums on seats.  Governments around the world made decisions to have free access to primary education for all.

There were classrooms going from 10 kids to 100 kids but with no improvement in the quality.  Kids came out of the school system with no better education.

I will follow on the conversation.  The witnesses spoke of the importance of encouraging girls into education.  Considering the Irish experience, it is not too different.  It is only two generations away when it was the boys in the family who went on to education and the girls who were kept at home.  It is not a huge distance.  I remember going to school and getting the milk and famous corned beef sandwich that was curled at the side or a bun or jam sandwich.  They were the supports for families.  When we came into this committee at 9.30 a.m. there were children getting breakfast in breakfast clubs, which we still have in Ireland.  That is important.  There is not huge distance between us in terms of supports for children who are living in poverty.  Consider literacy in the Irish context and the importance of literacy in the home.  A mother who does not read or a lone parent, for example, with no books in the home can be important factors that have an impact on the literacy of children in many of those households.  We must ask if this is a big difficulty or a big gap between the parent and the child.<\/p><p>Many people from a nationalist background in the North who were discriminated against in terms of housing, jobs, etc., went on to further education, got involved in civil rights and so on and demanded change.  Many things have happened around education.  It was stated that educated girls are less likely to be child brides.  I wish to develop that point.  Poverty is a big issue for many families.  I do not think any parent would give his or her child away to a rich man or similar unless there was a necessity to have one less child to feed.  It is not just cultural norms; much of the problem is caused by poverty.  I was going to ask about the privatisation of education but the witnesses have been clear on that matter.  The figures are staggering: one in five children is out of school, including 131 million girls.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the programmes in various countries.  Are they bespoke programmes taking into account cultural norms and so on in particular countries or is there a best practice approach on the basis that what works in Malawi might work in Zambia or Afghanistan?  Are there various local factors that cause difficulties in that regard?  There was reference to the experience in Afghanistan and the lack of women teachers there.  We know the impact caused by the Taliban in Afghanistan, as well as the impact of Boko Haram which targets boarding schools and the young women in them in Nigeria.  The students are on the front line.<\/p><p> How important is period poverty?  It is usually a woman or girl who is sent to get clean water.  I ask the witnesses to address the importance of access to free water.  It is important to have schools available in isolated areas such that people do not have to make dangerous long-distance journeys to school.<\/p><p> The transformative work being done by the witnesses is fantastic but it does not receive sufficient recognition.  There are significant challenges.  The more people who get educated, the more transformative it will be for society.  I began my contribution by referring to the big changes.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about children with special needs.  Yesterday, I raised the issue of a child in my constituency who has been waiting on supports for 52 months or nearly four and a half years.  If that is the Irish experience, what is the experience of children who are being left behind due to a club foot, polio or another disability in some of the countries where the witnesses work?  The cultural norms are different and it may be suggested that the child is possessed.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the importance of involving such children in the education system and the work being carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#F00700","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>The Deputy raised a large number of issues.  The issue of distance from school is a significant one, particularly for girls in many rural places in Africa.  There is generally a local or village primary school nearby but, as is the case in Ireland, there are fewer secondary schools and students must travel greater distances to get to them.  In many cases, doing so is unsafe.  We have been trying to build hostels for girls because if they rent rooms in towns, they are in great danger from men who may predate on them.  As Sr. Brigid stated, we are trying to establish boarding schools.  That may seem extreme, but in some cases it is probably the best way to keep girls going to secondary school safe and ensure they can progress.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of poverty and the significant dilemma parents may face.  Ideally, solving the poverty issue would solve a major portion of the issue of the priority allocated to girls' education.  In order to convince parents to allow girls to attend school, we offer to pay for scholarships, which is quite expensive but it recognises the value of girls.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the importance of mothers and the issue of girls becoming pregnant.  Last year, I was in Guinea-Bissau, where I encountered this issue.  I tried to remember, during the time when I was a child, who got the blame when a girl got pregnant.  Generally, the boy should get the blame because he is the father, but it was usually the mother who got the blame.  That was the case in Guinea-Bissau; the mother was blamed if her daughter got pregnant.  Mothers were doing a truly amazing thing, namely, they took their daughters to the local clinic to access contraception because they knew the girls were sexually active and wanted to protect them in order that they could continue to go to school.  That highlights the availability of contraception in local areas.  It may seem extreme, but mothers tend to be far more practical and much better able to protect their daughters and ensure they can continue to go to school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1453,"content":"<p>To pick up on Mr. O'Brien's comment on boarding schools, when I heard that we were establishing a boarding school when invited to start a secondary school in South Sudan 11 years ago, I was totally against it.  I taught in a boarding school in Dublin and had a western mindset.  On my first visit there, I encountered a girl in the primary school whose father was dead.  She lived in a hut known as a tukel, which has a straw roof, etc., with her mother and brother.  A boy armed with a rifle had broken into her hut the previous night and attempted to rape the girl but the mother clobbered him with a big stick and disarmed him.  The girl went to school the next day and said nothing.  Her mother came in later that day, told Sr. Orla the story and begged her to take the girl into the boarding school.  I found that I had to divest myself of my very strongly held opinions.  I looked at Sr. Orla and commented that it was not a boarding school; it was a safe haven or refuge for young women to get their education.  Many people, including some donors, have a particular reaction when they realise we are establishing a boarding school or a hostel.  We could not get funding for a hostel in a part of Kenya where the girls were living in awful conditions as we were establishing it in the area and beside our school.  We eventually managed to get the money and open the hostel.  It is full and those girls are getting an education.  If they had to stay at home in their informal dwellings, they would not be able to attend school and would be in danger of violence, rape, etc.  The hostel changed their lives completely.  A similar situation pertains in South Sudan and probably in all the other countries to which Mr. O'Brien referred.  The boarding schools are necessary to protect girls' safety, which is not the way that many in the West regard a boarding school.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to clean water.  Some of our funding comes from Irish Aid through Misean Cara.  One of the most recent projects we financed was to sink three wells in the local community in order to shorten the distance women and girls had to travel to get water and increase their safety.  The aid we receive is making a difference in people's lives.

It is valuable for the committee to hear of the work being done.   I join others in commending the great work being done, particularly in tackling low levels of school completion among girls in developing countries.  It is very useful to have a spotlight on the importance of promoting girls' education and challenging gender stereotypes.<\/p><p> I have three points.  First, I am struck by the huge number of obstacles to ensuring girls' equality of access to education in countries with enormous structural barriers such as a lack of a clean water supply, teachers or infrastructure, on which previous speakers focused.  We talked earlier about the SDGs and SDG4.  We were told that huge progress was made toward meeting SDG4, but that has levelled off since 2015.  Progress was made in the early years of this century and the numbers and percentages of children not in school were dropping, but since 2015 there has been a levelling off.  Can any of the witnesses explain why that progress has apparently stalled?  I presume the reasons are multifaceted, including increasing conflicts in some areas keeping children out of school, which was touched on.  Political decision-making at a macro level has also contributed to this issue.  Can anyone say why that is and what we can do about it?<\/p><p> Second, the lack of access to reproductive and sexual health affects women and girls' education completion, which we have touched on.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned access to contraception, which is hugely important, as is access to abortion, which can be vital in ensuring girls can finish their education.  That is lacking in so many countries, including Ireland until recently.  Our women's caucus is currently focused on period poverty, which has also been raised in many of the submissions.  Some 10% of girls in certain African countries are out of school during their periods, which means missing a quarter of their education straight away.  These are girls who are actually enrolled in school.  We clearly need to do more on this issue.  Do the witnesses have any comments on that, or are they working on any good models for it?<\/p><p> Finally, no one has mentioned female genital mutilation, FGM, which is another health issue for girls.  I will be speaking at an event on FGM next week which is being run by Akina Dada wa Africa, AkiDwA, together with the national steering committee on FGM.  Can we do more to tackle this issue through our Irish Aid programmes?  It has had huge health consequences for girls and women and even raised mortality rates in some cases.  What can we do in Ireland to ensure we are tackling this specific gendered issue of women's health, which is preventing so many girls from reaching their full potential?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#G00400","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>I will speak to the Senator's last point.  I will also be attending that AkiDwA conference next week and I am glad the Senator brought up FGM because it is so important.  It is linked with early marriage, in that when girls get circumcised, they are immediately taken out of school and married off.  Some say this is a cultural issue, but it is not.  It is a human rights issue.  We are trying to tackle this in all the communities in which we work and where it is practised.  In Ireland, we have funding for our programme on women's rights.  There is also a programme in Cork through which we work with the migrant communities on FGM.  More investment is needed from the Government to highlight this issue with the Irish police force and healthcare workers outside of the Dublin area, as most of these migrants are outside Dublin.  When people leave their home countries, they cling to their cultures much more.  One thing we do is explain to migrant communities here that we have dealt with this issue in some of the communities they are from, and that it has now been rejected and girls are back in school.  We try to show them that here.  That is one thing we are trying to do because FGM is so strongly linked with girls dropping out of school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Triona Pender"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>FGM is huge in many of the countries in which we operate.  It is not linked to religion but to culture.  We run a programme in Marsabit in northern Kenya, where FGM is a big part of the communities' culture, using a tool we call community conversations in order to engage adults on the impact of the practice.  We also engage the girls themselves through girls' clubs in school where they can come together and talk about the fact that they do not want FGM.  Girls are then able, with the support of their mothers, to challenge community norms and say it is no longer acceptable.  Religious leaders or government decrees or laws will not change this.  It is about getting into the fundamentals of the communities and changing behaviours and age-old cultural practices that seem unstoppable.  We must turn it around and give the power to the girls themselves, with the support of their mothers.  While the grandmothers are almost the enforcers of FGM in many communities, the mothers in particular are our allies in changing this dreadful human rights abuse, as Ms Pender has said.<\/p> <p>  Conflict is a huge issue which pushes back progress towards getting girls into school.  We are currently looking at northern Syria and what has happened to its education system, which was re-established eight or ten years ago when peace came to the region.  That has been destroyed in one weekend and people are running all over the place.  The tragedy of what is happening there is immeasurable, and we are all powerless to do anything to reverse it at this point.<\/p> <p>  On the quality of education, as mentioned earlier, there was a huge drive as part of the millennium development goals to get enormous numbers of children into school.  However, when we looked at the quality of the education those children were getting, it seemed there was a lack of investment in developing quality.  Children were going to school and learning nothing, and so parents pulled them out because there was no great advantage in keeping them in school.  We now have to tackle and reverse that trend.  A combination of factors has contributed to the levelling off of progress in getting children into school and keeping them there.<\/p> <p>  Girls' absences from school during their periods is also a huge issue, although some countries are beginning to tackle it.  Some girls are staying out of school for three, four or five days a month.  They are not making progress or keeping pace with their classmates.  They then find they have missed too much and just give up.  We must enable girls to stay in school during their periods by providing the resources which enable them to do that.

Syria was mentioned, but there are also issues with Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lake Chad region and other crises all around the world.<\/p> <p>  On quality of education, many parents came back to us to say we had convinced them that education was the way to go, and so they sent their children to school.  However, after a few years, they say that the children are not learning anything, so it is better for them to go to the field where they can at least help the family's income.  What do we say to that?  The same happens with children with disability.  We sensitised the community and they agreed to send their children to school, but they are not learning anything at school.  Parents then question why they should make that effort.  Sending children to school is important but we need to keep them in school and learning.  The problem with education is that it takes time.  It is not a fast solution; it takes years.  One does not see results or impacts in one or two years but in cycles or generations.<\/p> <p>  There are good practices.  Families must see that by sending girls to school, they can get good jobs, earn an income and help the family, as long as they finish primary or secondary school first.  Another way of keeping girls in school is to give them food to bring back to their families in order that they are an added value for the family.  That way, while the girls are not home and so cannot help with the field or the family's income, they are at least bringing in food every day.  It is not the solution but, over time, those girls will enter the work market and start to earn, and the family will see that there is much more to school than the food.  If girls can earn money and bring it home, they have added value.  The problem is that at the moment, all the funding is going towards crises, which is only right as we need to save human lives.  However, if we do not tackle the root causes around the world, crises will keep occurring.<\/p><p>We need to go back and think.  Education is a solution but it will take time.

In the recent past, we have had that experience, and not a very pleasant experience when we think back.  We can be to the fore in demanding that greater efforts are made and moneys spent to afford people proper educational opportunities in their lives, particularly where there is abuse of females in the sense of them being second-class citizens when it comes to education, and where the boys are educated because they are seen as the ones who will get the jobs and the money.<\/p> <p>  When I was listening to the witnesses, I got frightened and I realised I am getting old because I can think back very clearly to my early teenage years, when it was acceptable that girls would not get the opportunity of going on after the intermediate certificate, and they were privileged even to get the intermediate certificate.  We tend to forget our experience in this country and the tremendous value we got from changing so that people get a proper education, which made an enormous difference.  We do not always appreciate it when getting older, but I begin to realise now how fortunate all of us in this country are that we had people who made sacrifices.  I can remember clearly the efforts that had to be made to find the fees for secondary education, never mind third level education.  People had to pay for secondary education and there were very few families in the 1950s and 1960s who could afford to pay because people were very poor and we were a very poor country.<\/p> <p>  Ireland got out of that situation, thank goodness.  I believe we now have a moral responsibility to listen to what the witnesses are saying and to promote the need for awareness to give other people in other parts of the world the opportunity that we got.  Many people of my vintage never got the opportunity, and women in particular did not get the opportunity.  We had the vocational colleges, which gave the skills to people to have a trade and so on, but for girls in particular, there were very limited opportunities.  I get frightened when I think of that now because it was very cruel.  That is happening in other parts of the world.  I feel the witnesses have woken me up to my moral responsibilities and that we should be out there, banging the door, so to speak, and insisting that everybody gets the opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Despite all the talk about equal rights and all of that, what is equal rights?  If people do not get an equal right to an education, they have no rights.  It is quite simple, when we think about it.  Having lived through that period, I can appreciate the sacrifices that my parents had to make.  We take so much for granted now that we have become lazy in terms of defending the rights of people to get a proper education and proper skills for work.  We go on about opportunities, but if people do not have the basic skills for work, they are going nowhere.<\/p> <p>  When the witnesses speak of different parts of the world where they have experience, I get frightened that this is continuing to happen despite the wealth in the world today compared with even 50 years ago.  The witnesses have awakened an awareness for everybody.  I hope those in the Gallery, in particular the journalists, give this proper coverage to make people aware that this is happening next door to us and that people are suffering from a lack of opportunities.  When we think of the wealth of the world, it is frightening that it is continuing.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming in, waking me up a bit and frightening me.  There is an obligation on all of us to speak out about this.  I genuinely thank the witnesses for being here and making us aware.  I sincerely hope their advice and comments will get wider coverage because it is important that we are all reawakened to where we came from, certainly those of my vintage.  We had very little in this country and it was a privilege to get secondary education, given the sacrifices people had to make.  I thank the witnesses for attending.

I believe there are two issues, although I do not have the evidence for that.  The first is enrolment.  We can get a very big bang initially with enrolment, but as we have been alluding to, it is not necessarily about enrolment, and it is actually around the quality and outcomes in education, rather than just getting children into school.<\/p> <p>  The second point is that there is a big attack on education in a number of countries at the moment.  People have referred to Boko Haram.  The words \"Boko Haram\" mean \"No Western education\" in Hausa.  We are seeing this spreading across the Sahel.  The week before last, I was in Burkina Faso, a country that was called Upper Volta when I was at school.  It has an Islamic insurgency coming in from two sides, from Niger and from Mali in the north.  While I was there, more than 2,000 primary school were closed because of this insurgency and more than 400,000 people were internally displaced.  We do not see this in the Irish media at all because it is just a tiny place that nobody really cares about.  However, we have Irish Aid money there and we are working in an area that is currently not affected on a programme around inclusive quality education.<\/p> <p>  I want to pick up on one point.  Investment in education is very important and it cannot be something short-term.  It is not for two or three years.  It has to be something longer-term.  We encourage Irish Aid in the investments it has made in the Global Partnership for Education in regard to education and development, and more recently we are really encouraging about Education Cannot Wait, which is on the emergency side.  For example, I heard people say recently that they left Syria for the reason that they could not send their children to school.<\/p><p>It was not just because it was dangerous, they could not send their children to school and quickly recognised how they would have a lost generation if they could not get their children into school.  That was seemingly part of the reasoning behind people going to Turkey and other places.  It was that they could continue the education of their children.  While this may seem very doom and gloom in many ways, I am convinced that many parents are convinced, as are we, of the importance of sending their children to school.  If given the opportunity, they can also prioritise their daughters going to school.  This might take a bit more time in terms of poverty and some of the other issues about which we talked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1571266800,"counter":1463,"content":"<p>Deputy Crowe asked about best practice and standards versus unique approaches.  In a way, it is a bit of both.  Misean Cara has three pillars that we always try to support through members.  One is equitable access, while another is a constant focus on quality.  This is demand-driven because it comes from the students, especially the girls, their parents and the communities.  If we improve the quality, people see that merit and are more interested in going there.  Another pillar is system strengthening.  Much of that is about having advocates and champions and building the relationships about which Sr. Tunney spoke.  This involves low and slow work.  Much of it involves advocating for girls, inclusion and people with disabilities - those furthest behind and Leave No One Behind, as the sustainable development goals asked us to do.<\/p> <p>  Senator Bacik asked whether there are particular things we can think of regarding funding and policy.  One thing that is really important and that was also mentioned by Deputy Barrett is investment.  The 0.7% commitment is a really important aspect that has not gone away.  It is particularly important for Leave No One Behind and the farthest-behind-first agendas, which are integral to international development policy.  In respect of some of the countries about which we are talking, which are really poor, along with really poor or hard-to-reach places within countries or really poor contexts or cohorts of population that are very hard to reach, their governments cannot or will not fund education.  This is where ODA funding really comes into play.  It is same kind of funding that Ireland got from the EU as a disadvantaged country when it was needed.  It is not really aid, it is investment in people, the planet and the future, which we really need, and within that, continued commitment to untied aid, poor countries and, as we have recently seen, investment in public education and initiatives of the education cannot wait type.  In terms of policy, there is a balance between putting money into multilateral arrangements, which are certainly important, and global funds and supporting some of the NGOs and the work of missionaries, who are sometimes better able to deliver for way-off-the-tarmac people, namely, those who live in rural areas and are isolated.  Typically, these people are not reached by big multilateral programmes.  They are usually reached by slow, incremental and committed work over many years, which is the type of work Irish missionaries and NGOs do.  A policy balance needs to be struck regarding where we put our education funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1464,"content":"<p>I often wonder whether we are going backwards in some respects in the context of our global role in educating and helping others.  As a result of the fact that Ireland is wealthier and we are all better off, do we have the same level of commitment we should have towards what we would term the Third World?  There is a real fear that when a country moves on from being very poor , as ours has done, it might miss out in terms of the commitment it used to have?  Is that commitment still there in terms of helping those who need help?  Our experience is unique insofar as we can talk about things.  People who are my age remember what things used to be like because we experienced them.  I often wonder whether, as we grow wealthier, there is a danger that we will lose the things that made us great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#K00300","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1571266800,"counter":1465,"content":"<p>I refer to the Deputy's very apt comment.  In her statement after the budget, Suzanne Keatinge, CEO of D&oacute;chas, stated that there is clear evidence from all surveys that 94% of people support Government aid for poorer countries and aid that aims to eliminate and deal with injustice, conflict and hunger.  This means that there is a very strong attachment in this country.  Despite the economic challenges of the past decade, ODA has been remained at a good level under successive Governments.  We would all like to see it become stronger.  Ms Keatinge again called for re-engagement and the development of a roadmap with cross-party political consensus towards achieving the 0.7% of GNI target as our contribution to ODA.  This committee has been a very strong advocate of that.  I thank Sr. Tunney for referring to two of the recommendations we made in our 2018 review of Irish Aid whereby we asked the Government to consider additional support for missionaries.  Every group that appeared before us or that we met abroad consistently cited the work of Irish missionaries in the early days, be it in the delivery of education or health services or infrastructural development in those local communities such as providing water supply or a well.  We must always be conscious of that pioneering work, which is carried on so well today by missionaries, including lay missionaries, and the different NGOs working with their international counterparts.<\/p><p>Deputy Crowe mentioned the significant change in this country from the mid-1960s, when Donogh O'Malley introduced access to second-level education for everybody, onwards.  I know that each child going to primary school in Dublin at that time got a bottle of milk and a sandwich each day.  As a country person, I can say that we did not get any of that so there was even discrimination at that time against us country people, which, unfortunately, continues today.<\/p><p>Deputy Crowe also mentioned discrimination in Northern Ireland, be it with regard to housing, basic civil rights or education.  Last night, I attended the launch of a book authored by Joe Duffy and Freya McClements and entitled <i>Children of the Troubles: The Untold Story of the Children Killed in the Northern Ireland Conflict<\/i>.  The book was launched by the former President, Professor Mary McAleese, who, as usual, gave an outstanding speech.  She chronicled that era during which, unfortunately, 186 children were killed in the North and the South.  Some of those deaths occurred in my constituency, including a young girl from a family with which I am friends.  Professor McAleese referenced the day when she and her neighbour, another young lady, got her A level results.  Both of them got the necessary results that allowed them to go to university.  She made the point that the fact that two young women were going to third-level education was a celebration for the whole parish of Ardoyne.<\/p><p>That was in 1969.  Thankfully, there has been a significant improvement in gaining access to education.  By 2009 the State had achieved the highest level of participation in tertiary education in the European Union.  Although the figure for Northern Ireland might not be quite as high, the island as a whole has made considerable strides in that regard.<\/p><p> Following on from the committee's Irish Aid report which we all played a part in authoring, with our support staff, we were anxious to have an opportunity to meet our guests to lay particular emphasis on the need for high quality girls' education, an issue our colleague Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has always raised.  Violence against girls and women is another issue the committee has tried to highlight and address to raise awareness.  We are conscious of the good work done by our guests and their colleagues in so many difficult areas.  It is obvious that education is important to bring people out of the cycle of poverty and provide opportunities to maximise the potential of their country.  We have seen what the transfer of knowledge can do.  As a committee, we have engaged with Teagasc and other State agencies on the transfer of knowledge to countries where there is potential for the development of agronomy, the growth of crops and the production of food.  Teacher training which was mentioned by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan may be an issue on which we can engage with the universities and colleges of education to determine whether greater assistance can be given to those who work in education in developing countries.<\/p><p> We thank our guests sincerely for their comprehensive, yet succinct, presentations and engagement with members of the committee.  The issues raised by them are close to all of us in our work on the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2019101700002#K00400","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1571266800,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 11.15 a.m. until 10 a.m. on Thursday, 31 October 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
