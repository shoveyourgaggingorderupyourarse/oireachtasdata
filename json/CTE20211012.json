On correspondence, we have a number of matters to note.  Correspondence on the EU-UK Parliamentary Assembly, dated 7 October 2021, was sent by the Houses of the Oireachtas liaison officer to the EU Parliament dated 7 October 2021.  There is correspondence from the House of Lords European Affairs sub-committee on the protocol, dated 1 October 2021, regarding the proposed format of meeting with the clerk to the EU affairs committee.  The third item is a brief note by the clerk to the committee, dated 7 October 2021, on the visit to the Northern Ireland Executive committee.  Can I ask that correspondence be noted?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The minutes from our public meeting on 30 September also have to be noted.  The meeting in question was terminated due to IT issues, but can we adopt the minutes in any event?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the dispute resolution mechanism for the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, and the withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  I welcome our witnesses from the European Union division of the Department of Foreign Affairs: Ms Maeve Collins, director general; Ms Deirdre Farrell, director, EU-UK unit; and Mr. Karl Gardner, director, EU-UK unit.<\/p><p> I must inform our guests that witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence that they give to the committee.  This means that a witness has a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a meeting of the committee.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third party or entity.<\/p><p> As witnesses are all present in the committee room, there is no need for the next section. Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matter arising from the proceedings.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located within the Leinster House complex.  In this regard I ask all members prior to making their initial contribution to the meeting to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, please respect that direction.<\/p><p> With regard to Covid-19 guidance, members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and also to wear masks.<\/p><p> Without any further ado, I invite our witnesses to make their opening statements.  I call Ms Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#C00100","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633993200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and Senators for the opportunity to speak to the committee.  I have just returned from Brussels where I was serving as Ireland's deputy permanent representative to the EU.  I took up duty in my new post last Thursday.  I am delighted to have a chance to join the committee so early in my tenure as the new director general for the EU division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.<\/p> <p>  While I am new to this role, my time in Brussels has provided me with an awareness of the many challenges that Brexit brings to so many sectors across the European Union, but especially in Ireland.  I am also aware of the valuable contributions Members of the Oireachtas have made to Ireland's Brexit response.  Between them, the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, which includes the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the TCA underpin the UK's withdrawal from the EU and establish the framework for our new relationship.  While both agreements contain provisions and structures for governing the relationship, like most international agreements, they prudently also outline how the parties should engage where difficulties or issues of concern or disputes arise.<\/p> <p>  The avenues available for resolving disputes differ between the agreements and between the specific parts of the agreements depending on the issue in question.  However, the most important recourse is to try to resolve differences through dialogue.  This takes place, in the first instance, within a series of governing structures.  In the case of the withdrawal agreement, the joint committee is the overarching committee.<\/p><p>In the case of the withdrawal agreement, the joint committee is the overarching committee.  For the EU&ndash;UK trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, this is the partnership committee.  Both are led by Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi for the European Union, and Lord Frost for the UK.  This ensures that the appropriate political engagement and direction can be provided.  Each agreement provides for additional co-chaired specialised committees and working groups where EU and UK officials can engage on specific issues and discuss any points that could give rise to difficulties.<\/p><p> Ireland closely monitors the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the TCA.  We are fully engaged with the Commission and other member states to raise any concerns we might have about the implementation of the agreements and to make sure that our voice is heard.  In the case of the specialised committee on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Irish delegate is the only member state observer invited to speak for the EU side.  In hopefully infrequent cases where difficulties cannot be addressed in the committee structures, both agreements provide a framework for dispute resolution through arbitration.  The main features of the two arbitration systems are set out in the briefing note that we provided.  The note also highlights differences in approaches on issues such as timelines, panel sizes and remedies for non-compliance with an arbitration ruling.  A significant difference is that the withdrawal agreement allows for possible recourse to the European Court of Justice.  However, in both agreements, non-compliance can lead to suspension of treaty obligations.  Both agreements mandate the establishment of separate independent arbitration bodies.  For the withdrawal agreement, a panel of 25 members is now in place and includes one member who is Irish.  The 25-person panel for the TCA is in the process of being established.  While the arbitration process has not been invoked, should it be required, members will be selected from the appropriate panel.<\/p><p> I will address two other areas that may be of interest.  The TCA provides for the creation of an EU-UK parliamentary assembly to include 35 members each from the European Parliament and the UK Parliament.  Once established, it will be informed of the partnership council&rsquo;s decisions and can make recommendations to it.  The European Parliament has agreed its approach, and is in the process of determining which of its members will attend.  The UK Parliament is yet to determine its approach.<\/p><p> The protocol also includes elements relevant to dispute resolution.  The EU has twice initiated infringement proceedings against the UK for breach of obligations under the protocol.  The first of these was dropped after the offending clauses from the UK&rsquo;s Internal Market Bill were removed.  The second is currently on hold pending wider developments in EU-UK engagement on the implementation of the protocol.  Article 16, which we hear so much about, is a safeguard option which either party can invoke, if the application of the protocol leads to \"serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist\" or to \"diversion of trade\".  It is important to note that invoking Article 16 does not immediately suspend the protocol or allow either party to dispense with it.  It starts a process of engagement with a view to finding a commonly acceptable solution engagement.<\/p><p> While we have focused today on how we would address any difficulties that may arise, we hope that recourse to formal dispute resolution procedures under both of these agreements is not something that needs to be regularly relied upon by either party.  The agreements are about building a positive and mutually beneficial set of arrangements, supported by sustained, regular and detailed dialogue at official and political levels.  We remain committed to doing our part in making the relationship work.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I am happy to take any questions, as are my colleagues, who are probably more familiar with the technical details than I am.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633993200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Collins.  I am sure she is being modest.  I wish her the best of luck in her new role.  It is great to have this opportunity to engage with her, Ms Farrell and Mr. Gardner.  We did not foresee when we set up this meeting that it would be so timely.  We are all acutely aware of the political happenings related to this.  We want to be cautious and make sure that we do not do anything to disrupt that process in any negative way.<\/p><p>I ask members to indicate if they have a question but I might come in first.  There is quite a lot in that.  The witnesses have done a good job in putting together a succinct document.  It is all factual and every sentence is relevant.  It is a good opening statement and briefing document.  We might just break the discussion into two sections, first the withdrawal agreement and then the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  We might first focus on the withdrawal agreement, which currently is the main topic for discussion.  We are probably realising more and more how important it is to have those dispute resolution mechanisms.  While we hope that we never need to use them, they could be one of the more lasting things that stay with us when we move to the next phase of Brexit and the phase after that.  This will obviously be an ongoing process for many years.  <\/p><p> On the withdrawal agreement and the specialist committee, the witnesses should give a little more detail on how that works.  The Irish delegate has an opportunity to speak.  In the witnesses' opinion what is the strength of that?  Is the delegate's view heard?  At present, Commissioner &Scaron;efovi is representing the European Union, both overall and in the committee, and then there is the UK representative.  There has been an accusation previously that there is a lack of democratic oversight in terms of an elected person who could represent Ireland's interests.  Obviously therefore, this delegate is important to us in having our views heard.  To what extent does this delegate make his or her views known and to what is the strength of that?  What does that mean in practical terms?  If we have a dispute with all of the different agendas at play and all of the different wants and demands at play, how protected are we to make sure that in ten or 20 years&rsquo; time, we will be able to protect Ireland&rsquo;s interests?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#E00200","speaker":"1642","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633993200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  The key point is that by the time we get to those meetings, a huge amount of work has been done in advance.  A huge amount of engagement in respect of the agenda and our key points happens both in Brussels and through headquarters in Dublin before those meetings even happen.  In terms of political input, there is constant engagement between the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Commissioner &Scaron;efovi.  Ireland&rsquo;s inputs are fed into this process from an early point.  I am the delegate on the specialised committee and by the time one gets to the meeting, in general nothing will be said that will be a shock or a surprise to anyone.  On the day, we will be reinforcing our message again, as well as ensuring that it is not just the voice of the Commission and the UK, but that member states are watching this closely and are clearly engaged in the process.<\/p> <p>  As I am an official, I do not engage in the kind of political input the Chair is talking about.  However, as I said, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, have direct engagement with senior Commission officials and with the Commissioners and so on.

There are several specialised committees and we are focusing on the committee that deals with the protocol, which is the one in which the Chair is interested.  The specialised committee talks through the agreed agenda.  It was a useful meeting on the last occasion because it gave us a chance to catch up on elements of the protocol that the EU had concerns about, as well as to hear what the UK was doing in terms of implementation.  More broadly, it was a chance to allow the EU to once again repeat the need for complete, fuller implementation by the UK side.

We are waiting for one side to catch up in some aspects of it.<\/p> <p>  Returning to the specialist committee, it has been debating and deliberating over the last number of weeks around ways to make the protocol work a bit better for people.  It has been fantastic to see the engagement between the Vice President, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, the Irish Government, the Department and all the stakeholders in Northern Ireland to really get to the crux of what the problem is.  There seem to be very practical issues.  From the officials' work in the Department, what have been the key issues businesses and citizens are saying they want us to look at, in terms of day-to-day, practical living and business requirements?  What are their asks, essentially?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#H01400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633993200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Their biggest ask for them all is certainty, as the committee will have heard.  Businesses do not particularly like any form of uncertainty.  It is important to note that it has been good on citizens and business, it is not just focused on economics but the broader community.  They would like to see some form of clarity on customs and how the process is to work.  SPS checks have been raised in our engagements with businesses there and the committee will have heard that too.  Medicines are raised all the time.  The fourth thing is similar to the point the Chair made earlier which is the need for some form of engagement process between Northern Ireland and the Commission, that they understand what is happening in the Commission that impacts on them.  Those are the four broad areas that tend to be covered in our engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Gardner"},{"type":"speech","time":1633993200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The engagement process is something that would have been raised at the committee.

At a political level, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and so on, are constantly engaged with the parties in Northern Ireland, and not just the parties but also civic society, and business groups to make sure that what we are hearing also feeds into the Commission in the work we spoke of earlier, ensuring that the Commission is aware of what we are hearing on the ground.<\/p> <p>  Much of this not only falls on the Commission and the EU side; the UK can also decide how it will engage and bring certain elements of Northern Ireland, whether politics or civic society, into the debate as well.

There was a list of candidates all of whom had to be qualified and eligible to hold the highest judicial office in the land, so they all had a detailed legal background.  An assessment panel was then set up which included senior officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach and from the Office of the Attorney General.  It reviewed the CVs, publications and track records of the candidates and finally put forward two candidates, one of whom was agreed in Brussels as a suitable candidate for this panel.  My assumption is that other member states followed quite a similar process.  From the Irish perspective, it has the potential to be a very important role indeed so it was crucial to have a very rigorous assessment process of the person's professional and technical abilities and qualifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633993200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>Just to add, that was the arbitration panel for the withdrawal agreement which includes the protocol but the process is still under way for the arbitration panel for the TCA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1633993200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Is that a similar process for us domestically and beyond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2021101200002#K00100","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633993200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>If I recall correctly, the European Commission runs the process in a similar way to free trade agreements and other international agreements.
