The Action Plan was heavily informed by consultations with various groups over 2015 and 2016, and contains information related to school age childcare provision in Ireland and international best practice.  The Action Plan sets out the actions that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills can immediately progress to address the needs identified.  Progress on the Action Plan will be monitored and independently reviewed after three years.  The Plan highlights that the essential components of a child centred and effective model of school age childcare are access, affordability, and quality.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the actions committed to in the plan do not require additional funding at this point in time but will be delivered with existing resources.  For example, an immediate priority is the development of a comprehensive set of quality standards to specifically address the needs of school age children.  A robust system of quality assurance against the standards will also be designed and will be a requirement to be eligible for any State funding.  The Learner Fund my Department operates will be redesigned to include dedicated funding each year for education on school age childcare.  The Department of Education and Skills will use its existing resource to develop guidelines for schools interested in providing school age childcare services. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;3 million has been provided in 2017 for major and minor capital grants to ensure sufficient access to high quality and affordable school age childcare.  The new capital scheme will be open to both community\/not-for-profit and private services and will comprise three separate strands.  The first strand, for the establishment of new School Age Childcare services, will see a grant of up to &euro;20,000 being made available.  The second strand will see a grant of up to &euro;10,000 being made available for the expansion of existing services to provide additional places.  The third strand will see a grant of up to &euro;5,000 being made available to existing services to improve quality. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a budget of over &euro;460m per annum to address both the affordability and quality of early years and school age childcare.  Approximately 110,000 children benefit annually from the free pre-school scheme.  Another 31,000 children benefited from subsidised early years and school age childcare in 2015\/2016 with a budget available of approximately &euro;86m. <\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme which I plan to introduce on a phased basis from September is a key part of the School Age Childcare Action Plan.  It will provide a critical infrastructure for the provision of subsidised childcare to a much wider population, by suitably quality assured services.  The scheme will enable Government to make additional investment available, year on year I hope, to reduce the cost of childcare, ideally to reach a stage where Ireland compares favourably with its OECD counterparts.  The annual Estimates process will provide the mechanism for Government to consider the level of further investment possible for childcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 23 to 29, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[15225\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the interim report on the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[15210\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the second interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes will be published; the reason for the delay; if the scope of the terms of reference of the commission will be expanded; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 35 together.<\/p>  <p>  The survivors and loved ones of those who were resident in the Mother and Baby Homes must be central to our consideration of this complex and very emotive issue.  Like many of the Deputies in this house I have met and engaged with them.  Indeed one of the most memorable days of my time as Minister was at the site in Tuam before the Commission began its work.  There I met with survivors and Catherine Corless, who had recollections of the home.<\/p>  <p>  Some of those I met at the site are trying to find out what happened to loved ones who were resident there.  They want answers, they want the truth - and that is completely understandable.  As Deputies will understand it was an emotional day for all &ndash; as by coincidence later in the afternoon the Mother and Baby Home Commission confirmed it was going ahead with an investigation of the site.  In that regard I can also understand the impatience for the publication of the Second Interim Report - indeed I share that impatience.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware from previous PQs that it has been necessary for me to engage with Cabinet colleagues on issues in the report which extend beyond my own remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I again briefed Cabinet on the matter this morning and underlined the need for us to move swiftly to a conclusion.  Within the coming week the Government will be ready to clarify completion of this process.  Let me assure the House now that officials within my Department will ensure that survivor and other representative groups are advised of developments prior to any public announcements.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies are also asking about the terms of reference of the Mother and Baby Home Commission.  I am of course aware that there have been many calls for an extension of the terms.  I am  committed to a scoping exercise to examine that possibility.  It will examine whether broader terms of reference will help answer the questions of survivors, loved ones or indeed those questions we must face as a nation.  As Minister I need to consult with the Commission on this matter.  I will do so and make further announcements in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  It would be remiss of me however not to remind deputies that we must not lose sight of the breadth and considerable scope of the Commissions existing terms of reference.  The Commission does have significant autonomy to follow where the investigation takes it and can make any recommendations it deems necessary to Government.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies we are examining a dark period in our history - for too long only whispered about, that&rsquo;s if it was acknowledged at all.  The work and investigations being carried out are bringing a spotlight to these events.  It is and will continue to be emotional for all involved - it is and will continue to be uncomfortable for our country.  However it is work which must be done.  The Commission is two years into a three year work programme.  We must not say anything or take actions which will threaten to undermine that work.  Can I acknowledge the political unity which exists to achieve that truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[15202\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to restore funding to the youth services and facilities fund back to 2011 levels; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>I am pleased to confirm that I have allocated an extra &euro;5.5m in current funding to support the provision of youth services in 2017.

Where a family has childcare needs and has a net family income below &euro;47,500, they will be eligible for an income-related subsidy under the scheme.  The highest rates of subsidy will apply to families with net incomes below &euro;22,700, which includes all families whose incomes are below the relative income poverty line.  Approximately 99% of current beneficiaries of targeted childcare schemes will be eligible for a subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that in any situation where a current beneficiary of the Community Childcare Subvention or any other targeted childcare scheme would see their level of subsidy fall when the Affordable Childcare Scheme is introduced, their current level of support will be maintained for a transitional period.<\/p>  <p>  One change from the current targeted schemes is that, under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, if a parent is not engaged in any form of work, education or training, then at most 15 hours of subsidy will be available.  If the parent takes up any form of work (including part-time work) or training, they will be eligible for up to 40 hours of subsidy.  This approach reflects the fact that one of the core objectives of the Affordable Childcare Scheme is to support labour market activation.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will be a significant support helping families get out of poverty through work, education and training. <\/p>  <p>  When a parent is not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard hours basis.  This approach will mean that this scheme is open - albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours - to parents who stay at home to care for their children, and are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.  In the case of school-going children, the child development objectives are met through school-going hours and, as such, the 15 standard hours childcare applies to non-term time.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a small but important group of families for whom childcare is needed on child welfare grounds or for whom childcare is a necessary early intervention support, and where there is a referral to the Community Childcare Subvention scheme by Tusla.  For the Affordable Childcare Scheme, it is proposed that, where such a referral is made, families would automatically qualify for a subsidy without having to satisfy any income or work\/study test.  Tusla would recommend the hours of childcare needed, i.e. whether an enhanced or standard subsidy is required.  The scheme would then provide the maximum rate of subsidy in respect of those hours of care, and no payment would be asked of the parents in these circumstances.  This approach is consistent with current practice under CCS and is critical to supporting strong child welfare and protection practices.  My officials are currently in discussion with Tusla in relation to the way in which this referral process will operate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection Services Provision","counter":24,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":25,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[15023\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800057#WRA02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children in Tusla who have an allocated social worker; the number who do not have an allocated social worker, indicating the length of time without an allocated social worker; the categories of the unallocated cases such as priority, high risk, low risk and so on; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":26,"content":"<p>I have placed a high priority on addressing the number of children who are without an allocated social worker.

The aim of the ABC Programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children and families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  All sites are currently in contract for 2017 and operating according to their agreed budgets for 2017.  Due to contractual arrangements, each of the existing 13 sites is scheduled to come to the end of their contracts at various points throughout 2017. <\/p>  <p>  My department secured an additional &euro;4.5million in Budget 2016 to extend all of the existing ABC Programmes to the end of December 2017, bringing the total investment to &euro;34.2 million.

In addition to more than 4,000 centre-based childcare providers, which operate independently in a market context, all Tusla-registered childminders will also be eligible to participate in this Scheme.  It is acknowledged however, that the number of Tusla-registered childminders is currently small.  In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a childminder, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, my Department has established a Working Group on Childminders.  This Working Group, which is chaired by Childminding Ireland, and includes officials from Tusla and my Department, will make recommendations on reforms and supports necessary for the childminding sector in the short, medium and long term.  As part of their deliberations, the Working Group will consider the reforms and supports necessary to enable the cohort of childminders who are not currently eligible to participate in the Affordable Childcare Scheme  to do so.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question on addressing childcare costs, the Affordable Childcare Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare subsidisation schemes with a single, streamlined scheme which is more user-friendly for both parents and providers.  The new scheme will make childcare more affordable, and will enable both universal and targeted subsidies for parents towards their childcare costs.  Targeted subsidies will be available for children aged from 6 months up to 15 years and will address families&rsquo; full-time and part-time childcare needs, including outside of school hours and during school holiday time.  The level of subsidy will vary based on the parent&rsquo;s income, with the highest levels of subsidy provided to those on the lowest incomes, helping families to overcome disadvantage and contributing to a reduction in child poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The impact of the scheme on affordability depends on the subsidy rates and income thresholds set within the scheme, which reflect the level of public funding available.  Budget 2017 allocated an additional &euro;19m on top of funding from the existing targeted schemes.  As a result of the subsidy rates and income-thresholds proposed for the initial rollout of the scheme, I expect that the majority of current beneficiaries will see an increase in their level of subsidy.  In addition there will be a significant increase in the number of families that will benefit from subsidised childcare for the first time, including up to 25,000 families that will receive the universal subsidy.<\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is intended to provide a robust and flexible framework for future public investment.  Any future increases in the level of public investment will allow for additional support to further improve the affordability of childcare.

In preparing it, I want to make sure that it takes full account of a number of important inputs.  Firstly, the recently published Review of the DEIS Programme, which targets supports to schools and students in the most disadvantaged areas will inform the development of the School Completion Strategy.

Tusla has already taken steps in this area to strengthen the operation of the existing School Completion Programme.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility.  I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in decisions in this regard.  Under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates.  The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation, multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to valuation, Section 28(4) of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides that a revision of valuation to a particular property can be undertaken only if a material change of circumstances has occurred since the valuation of the property was last revised.  A material change in circumstances is defined as a change of circumstances, which consists of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors.  I am advised by the Valuation Office that if such a material change, within the definition in the Act, has occurred in relation to a specific property, the occupier can apply for a revision of the valuation in respect of the premises for a prescribed fee of &euro;250.  The relevant application form, Form R1, is available on the Valuation Office's website, www.valoff.ie, along with associated explanatory documentation. <\/p>  <p>  Where the Valuation Office proposes to enter a new valuation or amend an existing valuation on a Valuation List, there is an extensive process available to cater for ratepayers who may be dissatisfied with the proposed valuation they receive from the Valuation Office.  A dissatisfied person can make representations to the Valuation Office within 40 days of the date of the issue of the proposed valuation certificate.  The Valuation Office will consider any such representations and may or may not change the proposed valuation depending on the circumstances of each individual property.  If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with the final valuation to be placed on their property following consideration of the representations, they have a right to lodge a formal appeal with the Valuation Tribunal, which is an independent statutory body established for the purpose of hearing appeals against decisions of the Commissioner of Valuation.<\/p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors.  This has been the policy of successive governments for many years and is the express purpose of the National Revaluation Programme now being rolled out by the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.  The Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis.  This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made to date.  Revaluation is an important instrument in addressing historical anomalies in relation to commercial rates for both urban and rural properties and between particular classes of property within a local authority area.  In fact, the general outcome of the revaluations conducted to date by the Valuation Office has been that about 60% of ratepayers have had their liability for rates reduced following a revaluation and about 40% had an increase, a pattern which is most welcome and is expected to be replicated elsewhere as the programme advances.<\/p>  <p>  The current phase of the national revaluation programme is known as \"REVAL 2017\" and covers the revaluation of all rateable properties in counties Longford, Leitrim, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly, Kildare, Sligo, Carlow and Kilkenny where a revaluation is being undertaken for the first time since the nineteenth century and which also includes the second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area.  The revaluation in these counties will be completed in September 2017 and become effective for rating purposes from 2018 onwards.  The programme will then be extended to other counties including County Wexford which is tentatively listed for inclusion in the next phase of revaluation to be commenced this year.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that it is not the practice of the Valuation Office to comment on the specifics of individual properties.  I am advised that the property in question was last subject to a revision of valuation in 2000, at the request of Wexford County Council.  At that time, the existing valuation was considered to be adequate and was not revised.  However, as outlined above, it would be possible for the owners of the property in question to apply for a revision of valuation if a material change in circumstances has occurred in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800059#WRC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800059#WRC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[15364\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800059#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will confirm receipt of a file on Garda corruption handed to the Taoiseach at a location (details supplied) on 11 November 2011.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>As I have already informed the Deputy on 22 February 2017 in my response to a similar question on this matter, a complaint made by the person whom the Deputy refers to in her question was referred to the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM).

This means that 92% of the Report's 173 recommendations are now implemented, partially implemented or are in progress.  This is a significant increase on the 80% reported in the first audit of progress published last June.  I am especially pleased that the key recommendation of the Working Group, the introduction of a single application procedure within our international protection process, has been implemented, following commencement of the International Protection Act, 2015 on 31 December last.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the single procedure, an applicant will make one application, and will have all grounds for seeking international protection and to be permitted to remain in the State examined and determined in one process.  This will positively address another key recommendation of the Working Group, the length of time which applicants spend in the process and consequently in the Direct Provision system.<\/p>  <p>  I can also confirm that legal issues around the extension of the remit of the Offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include access for residents in Direct Provision centres have now been clarified.  I am pleased to say we can now give effect to this recommendation and I now expect that information will be made available by both Offices to residents in all accommodation centres.<\/p>  <p>  The latest audit report also highlights the many improvements in living conditions for applicants and their families in Direct Provision Centres including the introduction of an independent living system in Mosney which will be rolled out to other centres during the course of 2017 and beyond.  These improvements are in line with our commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reform the Direct Provision system.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has also been made in dealing with those in the protection process for the longest time.  When the Working Group examined the figures in 2015 there were 2,695 people in Direct Provision for 3 or more years.  As of 1st January this year, this has been reduced by 55% to 1,204 people.  The number of people in the system for 5 years or more has reduced by 58% from 1,946 to  811.  Only 251 of these are awaiting a final decision on their protection application and the vast majority of these cannot be processed for various reasons such as pending judicial review proceedings.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. <\/p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government  also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.

A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme.<\/p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.

A copy of the policy can be found on the Department's website (www.justice.ie) and it has been communicated to all relevant staff who have also received specialist training in the provisions of the Act and the policy.  The other vote holding bodies in the Justice sector have their own individual Protected Disclosure policies in place in line with the requirements of the Act. <\/p><p>The policy advises workers to report to their line manager in the first instance.  If a worker is reluctant to do this, they can report to the next highest level of management or to the Head of Internal Audit who acts as the final recipient for internal reporting.  Alternatively, as provided for in the Act, an individual can make a disclosure externally to other recipients. <\/p><p>On receipt, the procedure is that each disclosure is assessed by the Internal Audit Unit.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Internal Audit Unit is an independent function reporting to an Audit Committee and also to the Secretary General.  The preliminary assessment will determine if the disclosure comes within the scope of the legislation.  Some issues, for example, may be more appropriate to the Civil Service <i>Dignity at Work <\/i>policy.  The assessment will determine if the disclosure can be defined as a Protected Disclosure which will then be investigated.  At all times the details of the discloser are maintained in a confidential manner in line with the requirements of the Act.  <\/p><p>The disclosure will generally be investigated by the Internal Audit Unit although in some circumstances it may be appropriate to appoint an external investigator.  I am informed the investigator will meet with the Discloser personally and discuss the issue in more detail.  The investigation process considers all evidence and determines if a wrongdoing has occurred.  On completion of the investigation, the investigator makes a determination, assesses the further action required and outlines same in a report that is given to both the Discloser and the organisation.  The Discloser is kept informed throughout the process.  <\/p><p>The policy provides the option of a review process where a Discloser is not satisfied with the outcome of the initial investigation.  An external reviewer reviews the file and assesses whether the evidence is available on file to back up the determination and findings made from the initial investigation.  My Department has appointed a retired judge as the External Reviewer for this purpose.  <\/p><p>In line with section 22 of the 2014 Act, my Department publishes an annual report on matters dealt with under this internal policy.  In 2015 there were 5 such communications received, of these 3 did not relate to my department, 1 was deemed not to be a protected disclosure and 1 disclosure was investigated and upheld.  10 communications were received in 2016; however 6 did not relate to my Department, 3 were deemed not to come within the scope of the Act and 1 is under review.  An annual report in respect of 2016 will be published on the Department's website in due course.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that in certain instances my Department receives correspondence which is more appropriate for investigation by other organisations or agencies.  In these instances the discloser will be informed that the communication is to be forwarded to the appropriate organisation for follow up.  For example, where appropriate, correspondence may be forwarded to, for example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission or the Courts Service or another Government Department. <\/p><p>The Department is fully committed to ensuring that high standards are put in place throughout the organisation and its agencies, with a view to encouraging people to speak up.  A number of steps have been taken to promote and support those who wish to make a disclosure, including detailed training delivered by external experts to approximately 500 managers on the 2014 Act and the relevant policies.  In addition, both the Department and a number of its agencies have signed up to the Integrity at Work initiative delivered by Transparency International Ireland.  This is aimed at promoting awareness of the Protected Disclosure Act and supportive working environments for anyone reporting concerns about wrongdoing and driving improvements in the culture and conditions in organisations relating to disclosures.  My Department's policy encourages workers who wish to make a disclosure to contact Transparency International Ireland for support and advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Data","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[15094\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to reply to Parliamentary Question No. 53 of 16 February 2017, and a further reply of 7 March 2017, the number of drink driving offences that were struck out in each court due to non-service of a summons in the years 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>Further to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question number 53 of 16 February 2017, and my post-reply to him dated 7 March 2017, the Courts Service has provided the following table relating to the number of drink driving offences that were struck out in each court due to non-service of a summons in the years 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017.<\/p><p>It should be noted that a working group was established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine how the rate of summons serving can be improved and to regularly monitor the level of summons service throughout the country.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. <\/p><p>  It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.<\/p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. <\/p><p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and commenced Second Stage on 31 January 2017.

Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":214,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates Eligibility","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[15041\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800060#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the criteria required for a primary medical certificate to include those with degenerative illnesses, such as in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, payment of\u00a0a fuel grant, and an exemption from Motor Tax. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme, an applicant must have a permanent and severe physical disability within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations (S.I. 353 of 1994)\u00a0and satisfy one of the six qualifying criteria outlined in the Regulations.

to domestic assets for those resident here for tax purposes.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":276,"content":"<p>In order to estimate the potential revenue from a wealth tax, it is necessary to identify the wealth held by individuals.  As there is currently no such wealth tax in operation in Ireland, the Department understands that the Revenue Commissioners have no basis or requirement to compile the data needed to produce estimates in relation to a potential wealth tax.  Although an individual's assets and liabilities are declared to the Revenue in a number of specific circumstances (for example, after a death), this information is not a complete measure of assets and liabilities in the State, nor is it recorded in a manner that would allow analysis of the implications of an overarching wealth based tax. <\/p>  <p>  However, in 2013 the Central Statistics Office conducted the first comprehensive survey of household wealth in Ireland (the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS)).  The survey provides information on the ownership and values of different types of assets and liabilities along with more general information on income, employment and household composition. <\/p>  <p>  During 2016, my Department, jointly with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), conducted a research project into the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the potential implications of a wealth tax using the HFCS.  The research formed part of an on-going joint-research programme with the ESRI on the Macro-Economy and Taxation.  The research paper, available on the ESRI website, presented results on the composition of wealth across both the wealth and income distributions in Ireland.  A number of wealth tax scenarios were then applied to the Irish data (wealth tax regimes from other jurisdictions and hypothetical scenarios).  In each case,\u00a0the associated tax bases and revenue yields, the number of liable households across the income distribution, and the characteristics of the households affected are outlined. <\/p>  <p>  The wealth tax scenario in the research paper that is closest to the wealth tax outlined by the Deputy in his question is the high threshold-large exemptions scenario as outlined in Table 5 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study.  This scenario has a personal threshold of &euro;1.0 million (doubled if married and a &euro;500,000 increase per child), applies a 1% tax rate and excludes farms, the household main residence, business and pension assets.  Given it is not identical to the scenario outlined in the Deputy's question, care should be taken in interpreting the revenue estimates.  This scenario, given the distribution of household wealth in Ireland in 2013, is estimated to raise &euro;53 million as outlined in Table 8 of the Department of Finance\/ESRI study.  The research notes that its tax revenue estimates are static; in other words, no behavioural response to the tax is modelled.  The estimate of &euro;53 million, therefore, is likely to be an upper estimate of the revenue that could be raised.<\/p>  <p>  In order to estimate the yield from a tax with the precise parameters as outlined in the Deputy's question, it would be necessary to seek the agreement of the CSO to revisit its original survey data for this specified purpose.

Its conclusion was\u00a0\u00a0that it is not possible under the current legislative framework to provide for individuals to source motor insurance for Irish registered vehicles from insurers in other Member States.<\/p>  <p>  In coming to this conclusion, it examined the existing\u00a0legal and regulatory framework for the provision of insurance in the European Union (EU), as well as Irish law.\u00a0\u00a0The EU\u00a0framework allows for the freedom to provide services from one Member State into another throughout the Union.  This is a key principle of the European Union and is availed of by a number of insurance firms established in Ireland\u00a0in order to conduct business into other EU Member States, and also by companies authorised elsewhere conducting business into the Irish market.  This can be done either\u00a0through:<\/p>  <p>- establishing a branch operation in the host country and thus conducting business on a 'freedom of establishment' (FOE) basis; or <\/p>  <p>- writing business from the home country (i.e. where authorised) into the host country on a 'freedom of services' (FOS) basis.<\/p>  <p>  In both situations for companies wishing to do business in Ireland, \u00a0there is a requirement to become a member of the national bureau (\u00a0Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI)) under Section 78 of the Road Traffic Act.\u00a0This is an important requirement as the MIBI is the body in Ireland tasked with meeting the EU requirement of compensating victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0This position has been upheld in the case of DPP v Lepina and Suhanovs where one of the conclusions was that a vehicle registered \u00a0in the State must be insured by a vehicle \u00a0insurer who is a member of the national bureau (MIBI).<\/p>  <p>  In summary, therefore a vehicle registered and based in Ireland can legally only take out insurance with a company who is a member of MIBI which means that by definition they cannot purchase motor insurance in another Member State\u00a0where such companies will be members only of their own national bureau.<\/p>  <p>  This is a\u00a0complex issue which\u00a0would require a solution at EU level.\u00a0 The Working Group therefore recommended that my Department support efforts and raise awareness of the need to improve cross-border motor\u00a0insurance provision at the European\u00a0level.\u00a0 This work is ongoing and my officials continue to monitor the issue and raise it in the relevant forums.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800062#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Institutions Resolution Fund","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800062#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[15461\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800062#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money which has been paid into the Credit Institutions Resolution Fund since its establishment in 2012; the names of the credit institutions that have contributed; the amount they have contributed for each of the years since 2012; the amounts that have been paid out and to whom; the amount in the fund presently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Central Bank manages and administers\u00a0the Resolution Fund.\u00a0The purpose of the Resolution Fund under the 2011 Act\u00a0is to provide a source of funding for the resolution of financial instability in, or an imminent serious threat to the financial stability of, an authorised credit institution.

Its aim is make sustainable and appropriately priced finance available to viable Irish SMEs and support investment by them that encourages growth and facilitates employment across the whole country.  The SBCI does not lend directly, rather it lends its funds to SMEs through lending partners, known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has eight on-lending partners, three bank and five non-bank.  The SBCI is seeking to broaden its distribution capability and market coverage by adding new on-lenders and working to develop innovative products, thereby serving to drive competition in the SME finance market. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that, to the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent circa &euro;544 million to 12,589 SMEs supporting an estimated 67,150 jobs.  These figures represent a significant increase in lending by the SBCI during 2016.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors and are spread across every region of the country.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.\u00a0 The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.<\/p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  In recent months we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships coming on stream with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, developed jointly by the Insurance Institute of Ireland and the Institute of Technology Sligo, in September 2016.  The new Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship\u00a0also got underway last year, commencing in November 2016.  Some 13 further new apprenticeships are due to get underway later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0have also\u00a0launched an Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year.  Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Registrations in the 27 craft apprenticeship trades are rising strongly as the employment and economic situation improves and\u00a0I welcome that employers throughout the country are engaging strongly with the apprenticeship system.\u00a0 In 2015 there were 3,153 registrations in existing apprenticeships which represented a 17% increase on the previous year.  In 2016 there were 3,742 new registrations in craft apprenticeships, a further 19% increase.  This year the strong growth in new registrations continues with 893 apprentices registered at the end of February, 36% increase on the same period last year.  Current forecasts are that annual registrations will increase to 4,147 in 2017 and 4,697 in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council.

The DEIS Plan for 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.<\/p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.\u00a0 Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools in the DEIS School Support Programme.<\/p><p>Schools included in the list published\u00a0by my Department on\u00a013th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 This includes 15 new Urban Band 1 schools, 30 Urban Band 2 schools raised to Urban Band 1 status, 51 new Rural DEIS schools and 13 new Post Primary DEIS schools.\u00a0 Of the 79 new schools announced as DEIS schools in February, 25% are based in Donegal. <\/p><p>The key data sources used in the identification process\u00a0are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas\u00a0which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.\u00a0 Variables used in the\u00a0compilation of the\u00a0HP Index include\u00a0those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social\u00a0class, occupation and unemployment rates.\u00a0 This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.\u00a0 This data is applied uniformly across all schools in the country.\u00a0 Schools were not required to submit an application for inclusion in the programme as the centrally held data required was already held by my Department.<\/p><p>Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Schools which have not been included or upgraded\u00a0at this stage, including the schools referred to by the Deputy,\u00a0are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new identification process, which is fair and objective.<\/p><p>The DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to <i>social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13 February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. \u00a0I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others. \u00a0Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.\u00a0 The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800063#WRG07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit

Schools will be front-loaded with resources to provide additional\u00a0teaching support to all pupils who need such support.\u00a0<\/p><p>Where parents have concerns that their child is not getting access to the support the child needs, they should raise this concern with the Principal and in the event that they are not happy with the response they should raise this with the Board of Management. <\/p><p>As the profiled allocation is made to the school, schools may appeal the basis of this allocation and specifically whether the data used to calculate the profile was correct and whether it was correctly applied in the case of the school.<\/p><p>The NCSE\u00a0has published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: <i>www.ncse.ie<\/i>. \u00a0Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. <\/p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. \u00a0<\/p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>The model\u00a0will\u00a0also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are also being prepared and will be published shortly.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800064#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800064#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[15384\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800064#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a proposed school (details supplied);

The options included a predominantly state-funded system,\u00a0increased state funding with continuing upfront student fee and increased state funding with deferred payment of fees.  The report also recommended that employers should contribute more to the funding of higher education and that the scope of the National Training Fund should be extended to include greater support for programmes in higher education and the levy should be increased to facilitate this.<\/p>  <p>  The report is currently being examined by the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills with a view to making recommendations on a future funding model for higher education.<\/p>  <p>  The state currently provides a significant proportion of the core funding for higher education.  In Budget 2017 increased Exchequer investment in\u00a0 higher education of &euro;36.5m was secured, the first significant reinvestment in higher education since the beginning of the financial crisis and was made in response in the first instance to intensifying demographic pressures.  In addition, provision is again being made in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for demographic increases in the higher education sector which cumulatively will represent an additional &euro;160m investment by the Exchequer in the sector in the period 2017 &ndash; 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on foot of a commitment in Budget 2017 and arising from a recommendation in the Expert Group report, I and my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, launched a public consultation process on 10 March 2017\u00a0on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  The investment mechanism on which views are sought in the consultation process is the proposed incremental increase of the National Training Fund levy by 0.1% each year between 2018 &ndash; 2020.  It is estimated that should employment levels reach those forecast for 2020, together with the assumption of moderate growth in incomes, an increase in the levy from the current rate of 0.7% to 1% by 2020 could yield close to an additional &euro;200m.  Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform by 5 p.m. on Thursday 13 April 2017.  Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the development of a sustainable long-term funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors and will help to drive continued reform, quality and performance improvement across the sectors in line with the ambitions and objectives set out in the policy frameworks for the sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800064#WRH04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800065#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[15518\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800065#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps taken at primary and secondary levels to ensure that pupils learn money management skills which will be important throughout their lives;

It should be noted that they do not include some 15,000 duplicate\u00a0discs that were issued over the course of the year.<\/p><p><b>Number of Tax Discs issued in 2016 by Motor Tax Category<\/b><\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>Assessment   Class<\/b><\/th><th><b>Annual<\/b><\/th><th><b>Half   Yearly<\/b><\/th><th><b>Quarterly<\/b><\/th><th><b> Total<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Private   taxed on engine capacity (c.c.)<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>not   over 1,000<\/td><td>45,264<\/td><td>28,626<\/td><td>114,860<\/td><td>188,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,001   to 1,100<\/td><td>1,949<\/td><td>1,815<\/td><td>7,294<\/td><td>11,058<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,101   to 1,200<\/td><td>21,865<\/td><td>22,343<\/td><td>111,920<\/td><td>156,128<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,201   to 1,300<\/td><td>28,254<\/td><td>25,578<\/td><td>115,199<\/td><td>169,031<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,301   to 1,400<\/td><td>113,646<\/td><td>97,455<\/td><td>518,642<\/td><td>729,743<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,401   to 1,500<\/td><td>13,888<\/td><td>15,341<\/td><td>76,275<\/td><td>105,504<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,501   to 1,600<\/td><td>54,103<\/td><td>61,012<\/td><td>367,820<\/td><td>482,935<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,601   to 1,700<\/td><td>1,306<\/td><td>1,362<\/td><td>9,425<\/td><td>12,093<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,701   to 1,800<\/td><td>20,964<\/td><td>21,077<\/td><td>125,192<\/td><td>167,233<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,801   to 1,900<\/td><td>22,427<\/td><td>30,528<\/td><td>197,773<\/td><td>250,728<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1,901   to 2,000<\/td><td>32,915<\/td><td>35,555<\/td><td>244,075<\/td><td>312,545<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,001   to 2,100<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>486<\/td><td>656<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,101   to 2,200<\/td><td>4,707<\/td><td>4,698<\/td><td>27,908<\/td><td>37,313<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,201   to 2,300<\/td><td>1,660<\/td><td>1,725<\/td><td>10,244<\/td><td>13,629<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,301   to 2,400<\/td><td>836<\/td><td>844<\/td><td>3,157<\/td><td>4,837<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,401   to 2,500<\/td><td>4,198<\/td><td>3,716<\/td><td>20,825<\/td><td>28,739<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,501   to 2,600<\/td><td>350<\/td><td>308<\/td><td>1,569<\/td><td>2,227<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,601   to 2,700<\/td><td>462<\/td><td>501<\/td><td>3,175<\/td><td>4,138<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,701   to 2,800<\/td><td>1,117<\/td><td>992<\/td><td>3,431<\/td><td>5,540<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,801   to 2,900<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>139<\/td><td>182<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2,901   to 3,000<\/td><td>4,448<\/td><td>3,263<\/td><td>13,354<\/td><td>21,065<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3,001   or more<\/td><td>2,674<\/td><td>1,876<\/td><td>6,655<\/td><td>11,205<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Private   electric<\/td><td>53<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>61<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Private   taxed on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) - grams per km<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A0    -\u00a0 0 g\/km<\/td><td>1,492<\/td><td>191<\/td><td>473<\/td><td>2,156<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A1   -   1-80g\/km<\/td><td>2,506<\/td><td>438<\/td><td>602<\/td><td>3,546<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A2    - 81 - 100 g\/km<\/td><td>80,830<\/td><td>16,389<\/td><td>24,056<\/td><td>121,275<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A3    - 101 - 110 g\/km<\/td><td>119,326<\/td><td>26,267<\/td><td>43,382<\/td><td>188,975<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>A4\u00a0 - 111 - 120 g\/km<\/td><td>207,768<\/td><td>46,862<\/td><td>96,886<\/td><td>351,516<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B1\u00a0 - 121 - 130 g\/km<\/td><td>110,512<\/td><td>37,661<\/td><td>73,186<\/td><td>221,359<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>B2   - 131 - 140 g\/km<\/td><td>145,817<\/td><td>53,988<\/td><td>118,413<\/td><td>318,218<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>C    - 141 - 155 g\/km<\/td><td>59,708<\/td><td>30,347<\/td><td>89,199<\/td><td>179,254<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D\u00a0 - 156 - 170 g\/km<\/td><td>20,032<\/td><td>10,512<\/td><td>37,293<\/td><td>67,837<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>E   - 171 - 190 g\/km<\/td><td>8,533<\/td><td>4,200<\/td><td>13,776<\/td><td>26,509<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>F\u00a0 - 191 - 225 g\/km<\/td><td>3,367<\/td><td>2,010<\/td><td>4,229<\/td><td>9,606<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>G\u00a0 - over 225 g\/km<\/td><td>442<\/td><td>224<\/td><td>413<\/td><td>1,079<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Goods   vehicles - unladen weight (k.g.)<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Not   over 3,000 k.g.<\/td><td>225,733<\/td><td>83,334<\/td><td>157,888<\/td><td>466,955<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3,001   to 4,000\u00a0 k.g<\/td><td>3,045<\/td><td>1,023<\/td><td>1,287<\/td><td>5,355<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>4,001   to 12,000 k.g<\/td><td>16,387<\/td><td>5,409<\/td><td>6,330<\/td><td>28,126<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>12,001   or higher k.g.<\/td><td>9,760<\/td><td>3,124<\/td><td>4,343<\/td><td>17,227<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Goods   electric<\/td><td>76<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Buses   - Youth &amp;amp;

In that jurisdiction, a vehicle excise duty evasion survey is carried out on a bi-annual basis.  The results of the 2015 survey, the first following the abolition of the disc, found that the rate of unlicensed vehicles observed on the road was much higher than had been observed in the previous survey in 2013, prior to the abolition of the disc.  The survey concluded that the increase is probably due to the changes in the vehicle licensing system which took effect from October 2014.

The decision of the Working Group was that it was not recommending the phasing out of the paper-based insurance disc at this time.  In arriving at its conclusion, the Group noted the experience in the U.K. following the removal of the paper motor tax disc and, in terms of enforcement, set out that Ireland is not yet in a position to underpin an enforcement regime where technology would be the primary method of enforcement.  In relation to the use of ANPR, the Group recommended that the phasing out of the paper insurance disc should be reviewed in the future as the development of technology progresses.

While the 2009 Act provides the Minister with limited powers to issue directions and guidance to authorities as to the performance of their housing functions, Section 6 of the 2009 Act specifically precludes the Minister from intervening in individual housing cases.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent\u00a0in performing their functions, as provided for under section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001.  The Minister has no role in the normal day-to-day operations of individual local authorities.  The Minister's role in respect of local government is primarily to provide the policy, financial and legislative framework within which local authorities perform their functions.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, it is important to note that the Local Government Act 2001, Part 15, includes important provisions in relation to the ethical framework applicable to the local government sector, including providing a statutory basis for a code of conduct that has been issued for all local authority employees.  In the ordinary course of events, it would be a matter for the relevant local authority, in the first instance, to investigate any allegations of malpractice regarding the operation of its housing allocation system.  Subject to the outcome of any such investigation, it would then be for the local authority to consider what further action, either internally or by way of referring the matter to other relevant appropriate authorities, may be required.  However, where the outcome of any such investigation undertaken\u00a0were to give\u00a0rise to\u00a0legislation or policy issues\u00a0which fall within the remit of my Department, these would of course be considered.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Galway City Council undertook an investigation into an improper housing allocation.  The Council has advised that the outcome of\u00a0the investigation was that actions taken in relation to a social housing allocation were outside of the standard protocols and procedures for social housing allocations.  In addition to disciplinary action which I understand was taken by the Council, housing allocations procedures have also been reviewed by the Council and a Housing Allocations Group has been established within the Council&rsquo;s Housing Department to review and agree on social housing allocations before a recommendation is made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800065#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Mortgages","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800065#WRJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[14833\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800065#WRJ04100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason for the refusal of a choice home loan application in respect of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1329","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>I am not in a position to comment on the particular case referred to nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.<\/p>  <p>  An application for a Home Choice Loan\u00a0is submitted\u00a0via an authorised\u00a0mortgage broker to the Home Choice Loan central processing unit for assessment.

Almost three quarters of the\u00a0 households removed by Sligo County Council were excluded for failing to engage with the Council or a failure to meet all of the eligibility criteria.  A similar proportion of the numbers removed by Leitrim County Council were for a failure by\u00a0households to meet all of the eligibility criteria, households no longer residing in the Council's administrative area\u00a0or\u00a0a failure to engage with the Council.<\/p>  <p>  Under the 2016 SSHA\u00a0process, housing authorities were required\u00a0to review those households who were on their housing list to ensure that the details of the applicant households are up to date and accurate and that they remain eligible for, and in need of, social housing support in accordance with the criteria set down in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations.  As part of this assessment, all local authorities wrote to relevant households during 2016, including those in transitional and shared or emergency accommodation\u00a0where relevant, informing them of the assessment process and seeking updated information where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Where a household responded and was found to no longer meet the qualification criteria for social housing support in light of their updated details, they were removed from the list.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of an initial non-response by a household to a request for updated information, guidance issued by the Housing Agency advised housing authorities to contact the household again and to use all reasonable means of communication available to them in contacting the applicant.  Authorities were also advised to undertake local advertising campaigns informing households about the Summary.  Where a number of attempts to contact a household failed to elicit a response, authorities were advised that it was not unreasonable to then close the household&rsquo;s application.  However, housing authorities were also advised that should the household subsequently respond with the information required within a reasonable time, the application could be re-activated.<\/p>  <p>  Detailed and complete data on the total number of households removed from all housing authority lists as part of the process for the SSHA 2016, and the reasons for such removal, is not yet available.

First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work, to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. <\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 14.5% (30,500 persons) in February 2017 estimated by CSO, as compared to 17.2% (32,600) persons in February 2016 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons) in 2012.  Unemployment data are not available at the county level.  <\/p>  <p>  However, the number of young people signing on the Live Register in offices in Sligo and Leitrim (which may serve as an indicator of trends in unemployment) has fallen from 1,430 in February 2012 to 720 in February 2017.  I know that the Deputy will very much welcome this information. <\/p>  <p>  While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes for specific programmes nationally or at county level, some indicative figures are available for people aged under 25 at a national level.  For example:<\/p>  <p>-  The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey.  Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).<\/p>  <p>  -  JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefiting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.<\/p>  <p>  -  In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, of a possible maximum of 5.<\/p>  <p>  -  2016 results from the Customer Satisfaction Survey will be published shortly and show a similar high level of satisfaction among under 25 year olds Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes\/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth. Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.   <\/p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets additional targets in relation to addressing youth unemployment: 1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed; 2) to ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month; 3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers &ndash; these consolidate reforms undertaken in previous Pathways to Work strategies; the fourth action, to implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme, is a new programme.  The First Steps Programme has now been restructured and the pilot Skills For Life programme has been completed.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800066#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Benefits Data","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800066#WRK03600"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[14972\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800066#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons currently in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit in counties Sligo and Leitrim; the extent to which such numbers have fluctuated in the course of the past four years and to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":565,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is detailed in the following table.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the county level statistics indicate the number of people signing-on for payment at an office located in the county indicated.

Both schemes provide significant support to unemployed people such that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced payment, subject to continuing to satisfy all of the qualifying conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  The goal of Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy is to ensure that as many jobs as possible go to people on the Live Register.  Ensuring that work always pays and preventing long-term dependency on welfare are important aspects of this strategy.  In-work supports such as family income supplement (FIS) and the back to work family dividend (BTWFD) are key because they are stepping stones to ensure that recipients are better off in employment and can work towards financial independence over time.<\/p>  <p>  FIS targets families with children on low incomes where the parent works at least 19 hours per week.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might otherwise be only marginally better off than if s\/he were claiming other social welfare payments. <\/p>  <p>  The BTWFD allows those who had been in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment (including jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment) and recipients of the one-parent family payment, to retain their full increase for a qualified child payment for the first year of employment, tapering to 50 per cent in the second year.<\/p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.<\/p>  <p>  ESRI research, based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits and taxes, has found that people are better off in work than on welfare.  It demonstrates that more than 8 out of 10 unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40 per cent upon taking up employment.  Fewer than 3 per cent would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work.  Although the risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, less than 1 in 15 of that group would be financially better off not working.  The BTWFD reduces that figure to 1 in 20.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.  The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15 per cent in 2012 to 6.6 per cent in January 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the combination of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments, FIS, BTWFD and the part-time job incentive scheme provides considerable support for people to take up employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.  However, my Department is currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children in the context of a working family payment.  The main principles guiding this work are to make work pay and to reduce child poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800066#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Levels","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800066#WRK04500"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[14975\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800066#WRK04600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which he continues to monitor the age profile of those on the live register long term with a view to initiating measures to address the issue throughout the country and particularly in counties Sligo and Leitrim; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>The official measure of unemployment is sourced from the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS).  Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level. <\/p><p>This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories.  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments. <\/p><p>The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above. <\/p><p>By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service.

The decision taken simply reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  <\/p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone Services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up by CIB to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, professional fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.   <\/p>  <p>  The aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800067#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800067#WRL00950"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[14461\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800067#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the action he is taking to specifically assist the 79,700 long-term unemployed in the fourth quarter of 2016, representing over 54% of the total unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>Government policy to reduce unemployment is twofold.

The rate of long-term unemployment has fallen from a peak of 9.5% to 3.6% in Q4 2016.  The actual number of people who were long-term unemployed in Q4 2016, at 79,700 as cited in the question, is also very substantially down  from a peak of over 200,000 in early 2012.

In this regard, unless a farmer (or his or her spouse\/partner) met these qualifying criteria, he or she would not qualify for a FIS payment.

To qualify for the scheme a person must satisfy the means test and be engaged in farming.  The 2017 Revised Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure of approximately &euro;83 million on the farm assist scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation defines a farmer as a person engaged in farming, farming farm land including commonage, which is owned, and used for the purposes of husbandry, is leased, and used for the purposes of husbandry, or does not form part of a larger holding and is used for the purposes of husbandry.  Husbandry is defined as the working of the land with the object of extracting the traditional produce of the land.  This can include the cultivation of crops or trees (forestry) and the keeping of livestock and poultry.  There is no definition of a farm in social welfare legislation and there is no minimum acreage requirement.<\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient for a person simply to own a farm of land to qualify for farm assist.  The legislation prescribes that the claimant himself\/herself must be engaged in farming.  Therefore, a person who owns a farm of land, but leases, lets or rents out the entire holding does not satisfy this condition and so cannot qualify for farm assist.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing means for social assistance payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, account is taken of the income and the value of property, including capital, of the claimant and their spouse or partner.  Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property, including capital, owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes.  In such cases, the current market value of the property or land is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages, if any.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed as capital as follows: an initial amount (&euro;20,000 for most social assistance schemes) is disregarded; amounts between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000 are assessed at &euro;1 per &euro;1,000; amounts between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 are assessed at &euro;2 per &euro;1,000; and amounts over &euro;40,000 are assessed at &euro;4 per &euro;1,000.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that capital assessment does not include property which is being personally used or enjoyed by the claimant such as the family home where they reside or a premises or a farm of land used by the claimant in carrying out a business. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person is farming their land, the assessment of means, including for farm assist, is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming and looks at gross income, less allowable expenses necessarily incurred.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 I introduced new measures in relation to the assessment of means for farm assist.  Since 8 March 2017, farm income is now be assessed at 70%, down from 100%, with an additional annual means disregard of &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and subsequent children also introduced.  It is estimated that this will cost &euro;8.5 million in 2017.

My Department is working closely with the Department of the Taoiseach with a view to publishing a position paper with regard to the forthcoming negotiations before the European Council meets on 29 April.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has continued its programme of extensive engagement with EU partners with a view to ensuring that our unique priorities and concerns are clearly understood in advance of the negotiations.  It is also essential to understand the concerns and perspective of other Member States and of the EU Institutions.  In March alone, I have met with my counterparts from Italy, Luxembourg, Germany and Denmark.  Meetings at political level have been supplemented by numerous intensive discussions at official level, in Dublin and in other capitals.  By the end of this month, there will have been face-to-face meetings with all other Member States, in most cases a number of meetings.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that these efforts are bearing fruit, as instanced by the reference made during his recent address to the Committee of the Regions on 22 March, by Mr Barnier to the European Union&rsquo;s role in supporting the Good Friday Agreement and in ensuring that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU does not disturb the balance of the peace settlement and the process of reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  This is consistent with Mr Barnier&rsquo;s previous public comments, as well as the comments of European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, following his meeting with the Taoiseach last month. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has played a central role in preparing and supporting these efforts and will continue to do so.  Given the cross-cutting nature of the EU-UK dossier, a number of Divisions are very closely engaged with this issue, as are our Missions, under the overall direction of the Secretary General.  The European Union Division contains a specific team dedicated to the EU-UK negotiations, which will take the lead on the Article 50 process within the framework of the whole-of-government approach to Brexit, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representation to the European Union in Brussels will also play a key role. <\/p>  <p>  We will continue to build on this firm foundation in the coming weeks and months, so as to ensure that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe and are reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM00900"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[14999\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the resignation of a person (details supplied) from the UN due to its failure to accept two ESCWA reports describing an apartheid regime being applied in Israel; if his attention has further been drawn to these reports; his views on these reports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[15120\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the recent resignation of a person (details supplied) following the withdrawal of a report on current developments in the occupied territories of Palestine; his position and the measures he is taking on the matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[15121\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the resignation of a person (details supplied) in the United Nations; his plans to raise the reasons given by this person for their resignation at EU or UN level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 266, 271 and 272 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the resignation of the former UN Under-Secretary General and Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Executive Secretary, Rima Khalaf, and also of the report commissioned and published by the ESCWA member states on 15 March.  I understand also that another ESCWA report was withdrawn last month on the instruction of the UN Secretary General.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot comment on the content of the report, which has been withdrawn on the order of Secretary General Guterres.

Ireland has focused in particular on settlement expansion, and on related issues demolitions, evictions and expropriations, but also on a broader range of concerns such as the treatment of Palestinian children by the Israeli security forces, restrictions on the provision of humanitarian assistance to populations in need, and restriction of access to water supplies.  We have made known our concerns regarding discriminatory practices resulting from the occupation. <\/p>  <p>  A specific recent concern is the legislation passed by the Knesset in February, which aims to retrospectively legalise Jewish settlement outposts built on privately-owned Palestinian land. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, and the international community, remains committed to trying to achieve a two state solution to this conflict between neighbours.  The two state solution has been supported by public opinion and by responsible leaders in both Israeli and Palestinian society for many years, based on clear reasoning, and analysis of the various options and alternatives.  A two state outcome remains better than any other model that has been considered.    <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the two state solution, which can deliver peace, equality, security, freedom and justice for both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[15018\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800068#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that refugees who escape North Korea by crossing the border to China are regularly returned by China to North Korea; his views on whether this violates international law; and if he will raise the issue with his Chinese counterpart.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":687,"content":"<p>I am concerned about reports of cases of DPRK refugees and asylum seekers being arrested in China and facing refoulement to the DPRK.

While this policy had applied for many years, increased levels of recruitment to the Civil Service following the lifting of the moratorium gave rise to queries in respect of the appropriate pay point at which existing public\/civil servants should be assimilated.  It was recognised that starting at the minimum of the scale was a barrier to mobility where the successful candidates were existing public servants seeking a new appointment elsewhere in the public service at an analogous grade. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of Action 15 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan \"to expand career and mobility opportunities for staff across geographic, organisational and sectoral boundaries and the matter will be examined in further detail\" it was decided to review the policy relating to the starting pay of appointees from elsewhere in the public service, to the Civil Service. <\/p>  <p>  Such appointees had been treated as new entrants to the Civil Service and appointments were made at the minimum of the scale.\u00a0 It was decided that with effect from 30th November 2015, where the appointee had been serving elsewhere in the public service in analogous grade and pay-scale, the appointment could be made at the appointee's current point of scale.  This meant that such appointees could be assimilated on their current pay point on the same basis as a civil servant.\u00a0\u00a0Appointees would be required to mark time where their current salary was not an exact match in respect of incremental points. <\/p>  <p>  The revised arrangements outlined above apply only to appointments in an analogous grade and pay-scale and not to appointments to a higher grade which would be considered as a promotion.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the Civil Service, officers who secure promotion by way of internal competition, either via interdepartmental or departmental competition, have their starting pay calculated under the provisions of Circular 34\/77 Starting Pay on Promotion or Establishment.  In general, this means the minimum of the scale of the new post where the officer is currently on a lower point or, if more beneficial, at a point equivalent to existing pay plus accrued increment, if any, plus an immediate increment on the new scale.<\/p>  <p>  Where an officer secures a higher post by way of open competition, paragraph 11 of Circular 34\/77 applies and this provides that the starting pay of such officers is determined by the entry pay provisions of the Conditions of Service prescribed for the particular competition.  In most cases this will mean appointment at the minimum of the scale unless there is specific provision otherwise but in some cases an officer may enter the scale of the new grade above the minimum on an off-scale point.\u00a0 Essentially this allows the officer to retain their current level of pay\u00a0on a mark time basis. <\/p>  <p>  Currently there are no formal arrangements in place allowing similar treatment of staff moving from other State bodies to the Civil Service.

The site is privately owned and is one of the many locations managed by the OPW under the Guardianship provisions of the relevant National Monuments legislation.<\/p>  <p>  It came to the attention of the OPW in 2010 that the Donaghmore site had suffered some damage.  Specifically, one of the lintols had cracked.  Additionally, a number of vents providing airways into the structure appear to be blocked.  This rendered the site potentially unsafe for visitors and public access, which had previously been available through a local keyholder, was curtailed immediately the damage became known.   <\/p>  <p>  The OPW is not in a position to state conclusively who was responsible for the damage and is now focused on carrying out the necessary investigation works to assess the possible repairs to the structure.  To date however, the necessary staff have been addressing other more urgent priorities and it has not been possible to make a substantive start on assessment works.  It should also be reflected that, while a number of examinations of the site have been undertaken, the work is hampered by the unstable condition of the Monument and because, it is a confined space as defined by Health and Safety legislation.  This adds considerably to the logistical difficulties involved in accessing the interior of the structure to inspect it fully.   <\/p>  <p>  The damage sustained to the Monument is a potential structural failure in the first instance and although Archaeological advice is key, the solution and repair will be primarily led by engineering considerations.  Relevant archaeological staff of the Department of Arts Heritage Rural Regional and Gaeltacht Affairs have inspected the site and are working with the OPW to devise the necessary remedial work.   <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that the investigation will be progressed in 2017 and will be undertaken by the National Monuments Service staff based locally in Trim.  Given the underground nature of the site and the particular hazards associated with such spaces, it is not clear at this time  whether the reinstatement of public access to the Monument will be feasible.

The Independent Selection Committee will review the strategy towards the end of April.<\/p>  <p>  Provided that the strategy meets the required standard, I would expect to be in a position to sign a Funding Agreement for the delivery of the LEADER 2014-2020 Programme in east Galway shortly after the Selection Committee&rsquo;s deliberations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800069#WRN04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":803,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800070#WRO00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800070#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":803,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[14799\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800070#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the person or body that has responsibility for carrying out the transition review for the children who are leaving the early intervention class in a school (details supplied) in order that school authorities can make necessary arrangements.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":804,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

In 2006, the McKinsey report, <i>Children&rsquo;s Health First<\/i>, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  In 2012, the Dolphin Review Group was commissioned to advise on the progression of the new children's hospital.  Their report stated that &ldquo;co-location is essential and tri-location optimal&quot;, and identified St James&rsquo;s as the most suitable adult partner for the new children&rsquo;s hospital from both a clinical and research perspective.  St James&rsquo;s Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals, as well as a strong and well established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice.  In light of the above, the question of carrying out cost comparisons with other potential locations does not arise. <\/p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) was appointed in 2013 to plan, design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital on the St James's site and satellite outpatient and urgent care centres on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  An internationally recognised Design Team supported by an experienced Board and Project Team are in place, and have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project.  A highly competitive tender process, in which local and international companies participated, recently concluded for the core construction cost of the new children's hospital and satellite centres.  More than 35 people participated in review panels for the tenders.  The tenders were reviewed and measured against a number of technical and financial criteria, were independently peer-reviewed by construction experts with extensive experience of projects of this size and complexity and a company has been notified that it is the preferred bidder.  I understand that the final construction elements of the project compare favourably to the costs of international projects of a similar size and scale. <\/p><p>The updated capital costs have been incorporated into the Definitive Business Case for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, which has been prepared in accordance with the Public Spending Code which requires that projects are properly appraised, including the requirement for a Cost Benefit Analysis.

The plan is being rolled out at a regional and local level and involves full consultation with stakeholders. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  In May 2016, 2725 people lived in congregated settings and our objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.  A congregated setting is defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people. <\/p><p>The HSE has established a subgroup, under <i>&lsquo;Transforming Lives&rsquo;,<\/i>the Programme to implement the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions.

The first concerns the community rating levy on health insurance contracts and the second matter raised concerns charges for private patients in public hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the first matter, risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to support the objective of a community-rated health insurance market, whereby all customers pay the same net premium (adjusted to reflect any loadings applicable under lifetime community rating) for the same health insurance product, irrespective of age, gender or health status.  Under the risk equalisation scheme, credits are paid to insurers for their older and sicker members.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts written.  The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older and sicker members.  The scheme is self-funding and exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State. <\/p>  <p>  From 1 April 2017 the age-related credits paid to insurers in respect of older people will increase, to help to maintain the existing level of support for community rating.  Increasing the amount of age-based credits provided under the scheme requires changes in the stamp duty levy.  The levy will therefore increase by approximately 10% on all products written from 1 April onwards.  It is important to note that increasing the levy does not automatically increase costs across the market.  All of the monies collected are paid back to insurers in the form of credits.  The amount of any increase or decrease individual insurers pass on to consumers is a commercial decision for each of them.  Insurance companies operate as commercial providers and as Minister for Health, I have no legal power to intervene in relation to any insurer&rsquo;s pricing strategies. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the second issue, the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 provides for the charging of all private inpatients.  This Act addressed a situation identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 report whereby when a private inpatient was accommodated in a public or non-designated bed, no private inpatient charge applied.  The report noted that 45% of all private inpatient throughput was not the subject of a maintenance charge because the patient was accommodated in a designated public bed.  A further 5% was not charged for because the patient was accommodated in a non-designated bed, with the result that only 50% of private inpatient throughput gave rise to any maintenance charge at all.  This was despite the fact that due to treatment costs, the type of room in which a patient is accommodated is by no means the major contributor to the overall costs of a hospital stay.<\/p>  <p>  The absence of a maintenance charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system, to taxpayers and was an indirect subsidy to private insurance companies, which cover most private patients.  The charging regime set out in the Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was intended to decrease but not eliminate any gap in the cost of providing services to private in-patients.  The additional income generated as a result of the enactment of this legislation is a key element of the funding to the public hospital system and any curtailment of this funding stream would put pressure on the taxpayer to maintain services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800072#WRQ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures Data","counter":940,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800072#WRQ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":941,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[15077\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800072#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the process in his Department for dealing with protected disclosures under the 2014 Act; if the examinations of such disclosures are carried out by an independent authority or persons other than those in the organisation to which the disclosure refers; the number of disclosures received by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":942,"content":"<p>In keeping with the requirements of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and also in accordance with the Guidance provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department has developed Protected Disclosure Policy and Procedures for staff, to advise them on the approach to take when seeking to make a protected disclosure under the Act, or on how to respond on receipt of a protected disclosure from a body under my aegis.<\/p>  <p>  Protected disclosures received are always reported to the Secretary General in the first instance and assessed or investigated by a person at Principal Officer grade or above - none of the disclosures received related to the persons who investigated them.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 22 of the 2014 Act each Department must publish an annual report by 30 June each year on the number of disclosures received in the preceding year.

The National Positive Ageing Strategy (NPAS), published on 24 April 2013, highlights that ageing is not just a health issue, but rather requires a whole of Government approach to address a range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of our ageing citizens.  The NPAS provides a framework for cooperation to address age-related policy and service delivery across Government and society in the years ahead.  The Strategy is intended to promote older people&rsquo;s health and well being so that older people can continue to contribute to social, economic, cultural and family life in their own communities for as long as possible, thereby representing a vision for an age-friendly society.  <\/p><p>At the launch of the Strategy, a commitment was made to publish an Implementation Plan to facilitate the translation of the Goals and Objectives of the Strategy into action on the ground.  The approach to implementation originally included in the Strategy would have worked where a finite number of discrete and concrete steps could be taken after which the implementation could be deemed complete.  However, many of the objectives included in this Strategy are quite broad, and can be viewed as a set of principles to which Government has committed, and which will inform policies that affect older people on an indefinite basis into the future, rather than concrete objectives that can be delivered in the short term.<\/p><p>The Department has therefore formulated new arrangements to implement and monitor the implementation of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  The revised arrangements were approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform on 27 October, 2016.  The new proposals will see mechanisms established that will give stakeholder groups effective and on-going access to Government Departments and State Agencies relevant to older people.  An Annual Forum for stakeholders is being established which will seek to identify what stakeholders consider to be their key priorities for Government for the coming year and the next three years.  Issues will be considered on a thematic basis and will include Health, Social Protection, Transport, Security, Community Housing and Local Government etc.  Clear channels of communications will be established with relevant Government Departments assigning a named senior official to engage with stakeholder representatives on issues relevant to their remit.<\/p><p>The inaugural Stakeholder Forum will take place on 30 March 2017.<\/p><p>As part of the NPAS implementation process, a Healthy and Positive Ageing Initiative has been established in collaboration with the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies to measure the impact of the Strategy and establish an ongoing system for measuring and reporting on Positive Ageing.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and well-being linked to the Goals and Objectives of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of Positive Ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The Initiative is intended to provide evidence of the factors contributing to positive ageing, including at local level and ultimately inform policy responses to population ageing in Ireland.  The first national Positive Ageing Indicators report was published in 2016 and highlights many of the positive and negative aspects of growing old in Ireland.<\/p><p>The National Positive Ageing Strategy and the activities of the HaPAI are strongly embedded within the vision and actions set out for Healthy Ireland, the Government-led initiative which aims to create an Irish society where people of all ages can enjoy good physical and mental health, and where well-being<b><\/b>is<b><\/b>supported at every level of society.

NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination.  All relevant and appropriate information is taken into account when deciding to make changes to the State's immunisation programmes. <\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.  NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  <\/p>  <p>  Gardasil is the HPV vaccine used in Ireland in the context of the HSE schools immunisation programme.  In Ireland more than 660,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and almost 250,000 girls have been vaccinated against HPV.  Over 205 million doses of the HPV vaccine Gardasil have been distributed worldwide, either as part of national immunisation programmes or by private doctors.  Gardasil is currently used in over 25 European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.  The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.<\/p>  <p>  The focus for the HPV programme in 2017 is to counter the misinformation in relation to the safety of the HPV vaccine, and to increase the uptake rate in girls as part of the schools immunisation programme.

Under the risk equalisation scheme, credits are paid to insurers for their older and sicker members.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts written.  The scheme redistributes funds between insurers to meet some of the additional costs of insuring older and sicker members.  The scheme is self-funding and exchequer neutral, neither a cost nor a benefit to the State.<\/p>  <p>  From 1 April 2017 the age-related credits paid to insurers in respect of older people will increase to help to maintain the existing level of support for community rating.  Increasing the amount of age-based credits provided under the scheme requires changes in the stamp duty levy.  The levy will therefore increase by approximately 10% on all products written from 1 April onwards.  It is important to note that increasing the levy does not automatically increase costs across the market.  All of the monies collected are paid back to insurers in the form of credits.  The amount of any increase or decrease individual insurers pass on to consumers is a commercial decision for each of them.

The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the\u00a0Voisinage\u00a0arrangements.  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be legislated for is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as commencement order for the Bill.  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the\u00a0status quo\u00a0for fishing access that existed under the\u00a0Voisinage\u00a0arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October.  The only difference will be that the\u00a0Voisinage\u00a0arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.  The access arrangements for Northern Ireland boats will not change as a result of this Bill, Northern Ireland boats will simply regain fishing access they have had for decades under the\u00a0Voisinage arrangements in the zero to six nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State.  They will also continue to be subject to the same measures that apply to Irish-registered fishing boats.<\/p>  <p>  Fishing industry representatives have been briefed on the Bill and the associated measures at recent meetings with my Department.  I have also exchanged correspondence with fishing industry representatives and with deputies who made representations on behalf of concerned fishermen.\u00a0\u00a0I would reiterate that the purpose of the Bill is not to change long-standing fishing access arrangements but to take account of the Court&rsquo;s judgment and provide for arrangements that existed prior to 27 October 2016 to be reinstated within a legislative framework. \u00a0Access continues to be accommodated for Irish sea-fishing boats to fish within the Northern Ireland 0 to 6 nautical mile zone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800075#WRT01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":1155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800075#WRT01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1156,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[14855\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800075#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the current regulations for the protection of animal welfare while live animals are in situ or on docks awaiting loading on to a vessel.

","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1185,"content":"<p>The discussion on the future design of the CAP at the March Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting took place at an opportune time given the range of CAP-related discussions my European colleagues and I have had over recent months and in the light of the Commission&rsquo;s recent launch of its public consultation process on the modernisation and simplification of the policy.<\/p>  <p>  The future of the CAP is an issue of enormous importance for Ireland and indeed the European agriculture sector.\u00a0 The CAP has demonstrated its capacity to evolve very effectively in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands in recent years, to the point where it now plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.  It is vitally important for the CAP to continue its market orientation and to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European strategic objectives.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Maltese Presidency identified six priorities, which emerged from previous discussions, and which informed our discussion at March Council.\u00a0 The priorities are &ndash; building resilience, responding to environmental challenges, investing in rural viability and vitality, ensuring generational renewal, maintaining a market orientation and strengthening farmers&rsquo; position while simplification remains an over-arching principle for the future CAP.<\/p>  <p>  These priorities are largely consistent with what I and my Department view as the key challenges ahead.\u00a0 In my view the over-riding priority must be to support the sustainable intensification of food production to meet the requirements of a growing population while simultaneously meeting our environmental and climate change obligations.\u00a0 I believe this can be done by sharpening the focus on outcomes and by reducing the regulatory and audit burdens on Member States and farmers, as they implement measures to achieve these outcomes.  Innovation and the application of new technologies will play a critical role in this effort.<\/p>  <p>  The recent market difficulties experienced by farmers, demonstrated the need to build farmers resilience in the face of market volatility. \u00a0Modern and innovative measures to counteract these difficulties such as hedging arrangements, futures markets and fixed price contracts are areas worth considering and developing.  The direct payments system provides stability and certainty to farmers in the face of market volatility and should continue to be a key component of the future CAP.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am very supportive of efforts to encourage generational renewal as we have an ageing farmer population not unlike other Member States and the need to adopt new and innovative technologies as well as more sustainable methods of production will be paramount in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing these priorities, I think a more holistic approach is needed.\u00a0 For example, in the case of sustainable intensification, Member States need to be able to identify objectives &ndash; such as the production of more food in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way &ndash; and then be allowed to implement measures which will enable them to achieve those objectives.<\/p>  <p>  As regards CAP simplification, this remains an ongoing priority for us, given its capacity to reduce the administrative burden on farmers and national administrations.\u00a0 We are continuing to monitor the effectiveness of simplification and would like to see it go further, particularly in respect of the removal of guidelines and interpretations of regulations that have the effect of increasing the administrative burden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800075#WRT03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Issues","counter":1186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800075#WRT03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1187,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[14911\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800075#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the joint position by a dozen delegations at the recent EU Agriculture Ministers meeting which called for greater flexibility in the implementation of voluntary coupled aid and enhanced subsidiarity at national level, to grant coupled support in certain agricultural sectors that are particularly important for economic, social and environmental reasons and undergo certain difficulties.

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some agriculture sectors.  This Scheme is significant in this regard, providing farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital, which will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.<\/p><p>SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan's flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.<\/p><p>My Department's contribution of &euro;25million includes &euro;11 million from the EU's 'exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers'.  It was this exceptional aid package which facilitated the Scheme from an EU State Aid perspective, and additional funding is not possible under this particular arrangement.  Other sectors, such as tillage and horticulture, were facilitated by national funding under the '<i>de minimis'<\/i>' State Aid rules.<\/p><p>The Scheme is administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank and they will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, information is due to be provided shortly\u00a0and it will be made available as soon as possible.  However all of the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.

One of the Department's priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit, is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally, especially for the meat and dairy\u00a0sectors.  Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025.  We have achieved significant successes in recent years in conjunction with\u00a0the various stakeholders to increase the number of markets to which we\u00a0enjoy access.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of beef market access, 2016 saw the extension of our beef market access to the USA to include Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG) as well as the opening of the Canadian, New Zealand and Israeli beef markets.  Significant steps were also taken in terms of beef market access to China, South Korea and Vietnam in conjunction with the Trade Mission there.  2017 has already seen the re-opening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef and we expect that\u00a0beef exports may commence soon.  It has also seen the extension of our beef market access to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to include a range of minced and\u00a0processed\u00a0beef products, as part of my Trade Mission there.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working on expanding\u00a0market access for sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets.  For example, for\u00a0sheepmeat, the market in Iran opened in 2016.  It is also\u00a0working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which we already have access.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In relation to dairy, Irish dairy products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world.  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy.  In 2016 Ireland exported dairy products to over 130 countries.  Against the backdrop of our efforts to significantly increase dairy output and grow the sector, export market diversification is of the upmost importance, and this is particularly true in the context of a post-Brexit scenario. <\/p>  <p>  The meat market access work involves staff across the Department, including veterinary services, laboratory staff,\u00a0inspectorate staff,\u00a0International Trade Division\u00a0and a wide range of other divisions, in completing market access questionnaires, facilitating incoming inspection visits, diplomatic meetings,\u00a0agreeing\u00a0export health certificates etc.  All of this interconnected work facilitates the accessing of new markets.  The unit\u00a0also works very closely with external stakeholders such as Bord Bia, the industry,\u00a0Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its Embassies abroad. <\/p>  <p>  However, despite the significant successes achieved to date,\u00a0I am reviewing the Department's approach\u00a0to market access at present and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on this\u00a0in the near future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800078#WRW03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":1375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800078#WRW03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1376,"qnumday":518,"qnumall":"[15469\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800078#WRW03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress on gaining access for Irish meat products, that is, beef, lamb and pigment to China; the remaining stages in the approval process outstanding; and the approximate timeframe for all stages to be completed and full access granted.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1377,"content":"<p>Ireland enjoys market\u00a0access to the Chinese market for Irish pigmeat\u00a0 and a number of establishments are approved for export to China.

The SSC estimate the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on an average of the data\u00a0over the most recent five years.\u00a0 The use of a five year average ensures that a \"good\" or \"bad\" year in terms of salmon returns does not disproportionately impact assessments and that ephemeral incongruity is avoided in data sets and subsequent scientific advice.<\/p>  <p>  In contemplation of the 2017 fishing year, three scientific assessments of the salmon stock status on the river Slaney were undertaken.  These assessments were based on recent fish counter data, rod catch data, and catchment-wide electro-fishing data.  All three assessments indicate that the Slaney is not meeting its individual conservation limits for both one sea winter or multi sea winter salmon stocks.<\/p>  <p>  The scientific salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered best practice internationally, with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) that it deploys a significant protection and conservation resource into the river Slaney catchment including day and night surveillance operations, boat, kayak and foot patrols and monitoring of water quality.<\/p>  <p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following a Government decision in 2006\u00a0to cease the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery for conservation reasons.  Under this scheme, &euro;25 million was targeted at commercial salmon fishermen, who were active in the fishery at the time, and funding was provided to fishermen for them to permanently cease fishing and diversify into new activity.  In addition, &euro;5 million was provided for community based initiatives in areas affected by the cessation of fishing.\u00a0 It closed for applications on 31st December 2007 and was ceased, with all funds expended, in 2008.

I intend to publish a consultation\u00a0later this year to examine the potential for further phased increases to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme.\u00a0 These increases to the biofuels obligation rate on a phased basis will create increasing demand for biofuels and opportunities for their production.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government, my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport have established and are co-chairing a Low Emissions Vehicles (LEV) Task Force involving relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The work of the task force has been divided into two phases.  The first phase is focusing solely on Electric Vehicles\u00a0with the second phase\u00a0focusing on all other alternative fuels.<\/p>  <p>  The Task Force will report on an interim basis to Government on the first phase by June 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","counter":1424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1425,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[15354\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to remove or review section 15 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 related to immunity that the review group set up by his predecessor (details supplied) found in 2011, six years ago, might be unconstitutional; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1426,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[15355\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"when it is proposed that this investigation will commence further to the findings of the review group set up by his predecessor (details supplied) in 2011, six years ago, of alleged maladministration at the Environmental Protection Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1427,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 538 and 539 together.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA was established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 as a non-commercial and independent state-sponsored body.

The document does not refer to any actual allegation of maladministration against the EPA and thus there is no basis for an investigation as suggested in the question.<\/p>  <p>  The independent review of the EPA ultimately concluded that the EPA has the independence to arrive at informed and objective decisions, and to undertake objective assessment and reporting on the state of the environment.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;<\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.<\/p><p>There are c.27,500 premises in County Carlow, of which approximately 10,500 are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining 17,000 premises are located in the commercial blue area and\u00a0will be served by commercial operators.<\/p><p>All the townlands which the Deputy refers to fall within Amber areas on the map, with the exception of Kernanstown, which is predominantly Blue and so to be covered by commercial operators.\u00a0 Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.<\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.<\/p><p>In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.\u00a0 The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken\u00a0to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.  The Taskforce report is available at the following link: .<\/p><p>Minister Humphreys has established\u00a0two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services.\u00a0 Since July, there has been significant\u00a0progress made in discussions with\u00a0the key stakeholders including local authority management representation, Government Departments and State agencies, as well as interaction with ComReg and telecoms operators.<\/p><p>I have\u00a0signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with\u00a0the allocation of\u00a0spectrum in the 3.6GHz band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have\u00a0also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to\u00a0provide\u00a0enhanced mobile services.<\/p><p>These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country including County Carlow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX05500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":1434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1435,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[14934\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800079#WRX05500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if there are current EU directives that have to be enacted here that deal with an issue (details suppled).","asker":"1365","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1436,"content":"<p>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961 as amended, compulsory motor insurance applies to vehicles\u00a0used in a public place.

In today&rsquo;s increasingly inter-connected world, geopolitical, technological and financial forces that happen elsewhere have implications for Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth.\u00a0 Competition to attract FDI has intensified significantly, and all of FDI is hard won. <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 was published just over a year ago and sets a roadmap for longer term enterprise development.  Our vision for Ireland is to be the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.  Enterprise 2025 sets out actions that focus on building competitive advantage, on ensuring a supportive business environment, and on realising a significant uplift in the performance of enterprises based here in terms of innovation, export potential and productivity, and on attracting further investment. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s new trade and investment strategy, Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World, was published in March of this year and reflects, therefore, the current thinking and ambition of the entire range of Government departments and agencies involved in trade-related activities. \u00a0The Strategy reflects the importance of protecting and intensifying our well-established markets in the UK and the US while simultaneously diversifying into other global markets.\u00a0 This is reflected in targets such as:<\/p>  <p>  - 80% of export growth in indigenous enterprises to reach markets outside the UK <\/p>  <p>  - increase exports to the Eurozone by 50% <\/p>  <p>  - at least 60% of growth in food and drink exports to occur in Asia, North America and Africa. <\/p>  <p>  The policies we have put in place ensure we are anticipatory and responsive and build resilience in our enterprise base.  The evidence shows that these policies are working.<\/p>  <p>  According to the latest CSO data, there were over 2 million people at work at the end of 2016 and we are well on track to\u00a0achieve our ambition to have 2.18 people in employment by 2020.  There are almost 209,000 additional people at work since the start of the Action Plan for Jobs Process in 2012.  In the twelve months to the end of 2016, an additional 65,100 are at work.  The enterprise development agencies recorded another successful year in 2016 in terms of supporting job creation and investment.  The unemployment rate is now down to below 7.0%, from over 15.1% in 2012. \u00a0Ireland is now ranked 7th overall in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook &ndash; a significant improvement from 24th in 2011. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the very positive progress that has been made in recent years, I have already secured additional resources to allow us build on the momentum that has been generated. <\/p>  <p>  While I remain confident, therefore, of the continued relevance of Enterprise 2025 in terms of its focus on resilience of the enterprise base, it is nonetheless timely to review its progress and identify any additional actions or changes necessary in light of more recent global challenges.

The Competition Act 2002 as amended closely reflects these provisions in Irish law and this legal situation will continue after Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the European Commission is empowered by the Treaty to apply these rules and has a number of investigative powers (e.g. inspection at business and non-business premises, written requests for information, etc.) and may impose fines on undertakings which violate the EU rules. It works closely with Member States where anti-competitive practices are alleged to be taking place cross border or in more than one Member State to bring about an end to such practices. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of competition law is to protect and benefit consumers.  Greater competition provides good value for consumers, stimulates business, and enhances the economy as a whole while anti-competitive behaviour results in consumers paying higher prices without any extra benefits and undermines the competitiveness of the Irish economy.  The greatest harm comes from cartel type activity including price-fixing, which deprives consumers of the benefits of vigorous competition on price, service and innovation. Such activity is characterised by hidden costs and higher prices.<\/p>  <p>  It is too early to say what impact Brexit may have on the UK&rsquo;s regulatory and competition environment. Provisions on State Aids and competition policy are a common feature of EU Free Trade Agreements to ensure any aid granted by authorities to private entities does not distort competition.\u00a0 The terms of any future free trade agreement, including state aid rules, would be a matter for the EU 27 and the UK to agree as part of any negotiation.<\/p>  <p>  From a regional perspective, the Action Plan for Jobs 2017 includes a series of collaborative actions aimed at stimulating regional growth, including the progression, monitoring and support of the eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which aims to realise the national Action Plan&rsquo;s regional employment targets.<\/p>  <p>  The North East\/North West Plan aims to support the creation of 28,000 jobs across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth by 2020.

This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth. \u00a0The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets. \u00a0In 2017 we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.

Of the children in care, 93% were in foster care nationally; there were 4,102 (66%) children in general foster care, 1,715 (27%) in relative care and 316 (5%) children were in a residential care placement.  <\/p><p>The breakdown by age for children in foster care in 2016 is not available as yet, however Tusla has provided a breakdown of provisional figures for 2015.  At the end of December 2015 there were 4,110 children in foster care nationally.

At that time, 5,906 children were in general foster care nationally.  Of these, 523 (9%) had been diagnosed by a Clinical Specialist as having a moderate to severe disability.  The Census 2011 results published by the Central Statistics report that nationally the percentage of children aged 14 years and under with a disability was 5.4%.<\/p><p>I have placed a high priority on addressing the number of children who are without an allocated social worker.  I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure that a social worker is allocated to all children and young people who need one.  <\/p><p>The number of children without an allocated social worker at the end of 2016 was 5,413 representing a reduction of 19% (1,305) over the course of the year.

The EWS receives referrals from school authorities, parents and others relating to concerns for the educational welfare of individual children.

The Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) provided to 400 DEIS schools to facilitate positive relationships between parents and their children&rsquo;s school.  The School Completion Programme (SCP) provides intensive supports to students at risk of early school leaving to enable these students to complete their education.

The key principle of the Children Act 2001 is that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  When children come into contact with the criminal justice system there is an emphasis on the promotion of community based options in the first instance.  The Irish Youth Justice Service oversees a significant investment in community based programmes to divert young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  In 2016, approximately &euro;17m has been allocated by the Department of Justice and Equality to the Irish Youth Justice Service to administer Garda Youth Diversion Projects, Young Persons Probation Projects and a number of other youth diversion community-based projects.  These projects also benefit from support under the European Social Fund.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides funding to the Irish Youth Justice Service for services relating to the Oberstown Children Detention Campus (Oberstown) and the Bail Supervision Scheme which has recently been established on a pilot basis.  <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the Bail Supervision Scheme will provide more therapeutic supports in the community for children who are subject to bail conditions.

This requirement came into effect for newly-registering services on 30 June 2016 and for existing services on 31 December 2016.  The requirement to have a qualification to provide care and education to young children has been extensively welcomed.  <\/p>  <p>  I recognise the impact that this change is having on community settings &ndash; from my own experience, from a number of meetings I have had with providers and representative groups, and from the Early Years Forum I established to ensure that providers&rsquo; voices are heard.  I am acutely aware of the challenge that has been posed to services.  <\/p>  <p>  In preparation for the implementation of the Regulations, my Department commissioned Childcare Committees Ireland (CCI) to investigate the impact of the new childcare regulations on community childcare providers.  All Community Childcare services around the country were afforded an opportunity to engage with this project during 2016, and detailed analysis has been completed.  <\/p>  <p>  The CCI work indicated that the vast majority of services would not face financial hardship as a result of changes required under the regulations.  However it did find that some services had come to rely on Community Employment (CE) scheme workers, and I determined that these services should be provided with additional funding until September 2017, to enable them to transition to a more sustainable footing.  Of course, the position of CE scheme workers is only one aspect of the challenge facing community services, and I absolutely recognise that this funding is acutely required in light of these challenges.  <\/p>  <p>  The sector has taken the initiative in commissioning and completing research highlighting the challenges they face, and I am aware that we need to get the funding model right for these services.  This is a complex issue; and I hope that providers will appreciate that we have had to move to tackle the most urgent issues first, designing a new model of eligibility for families, tackling the CE scheme issue and providing funding for &lsquo;non-contact time&rsquo; for the first time.

A range of professionals including teachers, nurses, early years educators, Garda&iacute; and other health professionals, who see children regularly, are in a good position to identify children at risk.  Where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately contact Tusla.  The Children First Act, 2015, once it is fully commenced, will place a statutory obligation on key professionals (mandated persons) to report concerns of harm above a defined threshold to Tusla without delay.  It is my intention that these provisions will be commenced by the end of 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Child Care Act, 1991 and the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection.  When a child cannot live with their parents and is received into care, it is Tusla policy to place them in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community.  A very small minority of children under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behavioural or other difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability.  The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided residential services or a privately commissioned service.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has Foster Care Committees in place across the country and regularly seeks to recruit more foster carers.  In addition, Tusla procures and develops residential accommodation to deliver on its annual business plan objectives.  Tusla also procures a range of services from the private sector, including additional foster or residential placements, and such specialist services as are needed to address individual care plans.  Tusla also co-ordinates with the relevant State bodies, accessing supports across a range of areas, including health, psychosocial services and education.  <\/p>  <p>  Each referral received by the Agency is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the duty social work team.  It is of note that, at the end of Quarter 3, 2016, Tusla reported that approximately 60% of the referrals received were of a child welfare concern, and the remaining related to child protection concerns.  Tusla refers child welfare concerns to the relevant family and community support services.  At any stage, if circumstances change or new information comes to light and there is concern about abuse, the child protection pathway is followed.  <\/p>  <p>  Tusla provides me with information on a monthly and quarterly basis outlining the increasing demands for their services, and how they are dealing with children awaiting services.  This information provides me with the information needed to assess how well we are supporting vulnerable children.  Also, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), inspects Tusla child welfare and protection services, statutory children&rsquo;s residential care centres and foster care services while Tusla inspects children&rsquo;s residential centres run by the private and voluntary sectors.  <\/p>  <p>  This valuable and detailed information continues to inform the Department and Tusla in the business planning needed to maintain and further enhance the range of services for the care and protection of children.  Tusla is currently engaged in the second year of a three year recruitment programme to expand the cohort of social workers, social care workers and business support staff.  I have secured additional funding for Tusla to enable this and the current and capital Exchequer funding for Tusla is some &euro;713 million for 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800083#WRBB06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Functions","counter":1666,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800083#WRBB06350"},{"type":"question","counter":1667,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[15453\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017032800083#WRBB06400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which the investigative structures within her department are deemed adequate to meet current and future requirements as evaluated by reference to the time taken to respond to individual cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1668,"content":"<p>The nature of my Department's work is significantly oriented towards policy development and co-ordination of actions across agencies, rather than dealing with individual cases.

His application was assessed by the Board of Assessors (a Judge and two senior Old IRA officers) which was constituted under that Act to assess such applications and service.  Although he had claimed for Easter 1916 service, the Board did not award him service for pension purposes in respect of this period.  He was, however, awarded a Certificate of Military Service for the period 1 April 1920 to 30 September 1923 (including service in the National Army).<\/p><p>Section 3(6) of the Military Service Pensions Act 1924 provided that the Board of Assessors could at any time re-open their findings at the request of the Minister on the ground that evidence not previously available was now available.  The person in question did subsequently appeal to the then Minister for Defence in 1928 to have his case re-opened but his appeal was unsuccessful. <\/p><p>The power given to the Board of Assessors to reopen findings was removed by the Military Services Pensions Act 1949.  There is now no statutory provision to re-open the findings of the Board.  The process by which applications and petitions or appeals under the Military Service Pensions Acts were made, investigated and verified was wound up in 1958 and there is no statutory or other mechanism available now by which service can be investigated or verified. <\/p><p>The 1916 Medal was awarded to persons who were awarded 1916 service under the Military Service Pensions Acts, or to those who did not apply for a pension but who satisfied the Minister that they would have been awarded 1916 service if they had applied under the Acts. <\/p><p>There are witness statements held in the Military Archives which are stated to be relevant to this case.  I understand these are Witness Statements from the Bureau of Military History.  Decisions regarding the award of medals\/pensions are dependent on verification and corroborative evidence of the service involved.  Unfortunately, the &lsquo;Witness Statements&rsquo; which were collected from 1947-1957, were not verified and tested as part of a formal process under the relevant Acts, and therefore they cannot be accepted as evidence of service.<\/p><p>I should however say that the relevant pension files, which include material relating to his claimed activities in relation to Easter Week 1916, are now publicly available online on the Military Archives website ().  His activities in Easter Week 1916, while not reaching the threshold for a pension and thus a 1916 medal, are a matter of public record.  The Service Medal (1917-1921), with bar, was awarded to the person in question in respect of his service during the 1917-1921 period.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to do anything further regarding the issue of a 1916 Medal but I hope this helps to clarify matters. <\/p><p>In 2016 the State undertook a comprehensive programme of commemorations to mark the centenary year of the 1916 Easter Rising.

It also highlights a number of medium and long term strategies in the area of manpower planning.  The White Paper addresses the need to review and develop medium term planning requirements so as to deliver an effective and efficient mix in terms of age profile, skills, competencies and experience, and current policies to support this will be further developed and implemented.  To that end, White Paper projects are currently underway and are being jointly developed by military and civil personnel.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the purpose of the recent Defence Forces Climate Survey is to inform consideration of the ongoing human resource and strategic needs of the Defence Forces.  The responses to the issues raised in the Climate Survey resulted in the formulation of an Action Plan which is being led by the Chief of Staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Government in the White Paper on Defence 2015, committed to a Permanent Defence Force establishment of at least 9,500 serving personnel.  To this end, the Defence Forces have recruited 690 personnel in 2016 and have an overall recruitment target of 850 to 900 personnel across all three services in this current year.  The Defence Forces continue to recruit at cadet, specialist and general service levels for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Both the General Service and Cadet competitions are currently open and competitions for direct entry watch keepers in the Naval Service will result in inductions shortly.<\/p>  <p>  The retention of personnel, particularly experienced Pilot Officers in the Air Corps, has been a significant challenge for the Defence Organisation in recent years.  Actions are underway to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps.  In relation specifically to the resourcing of Air Traffic Controllers, six (6) Air Traffic Services personnel are part-way through their training and a further eight students commenced training on Monday, 27 March 2017.\u00a0   <\/p>  <p>  At present there are 3 Cadet Classes, totalling 27 personnel at various stages of Pilot Officer training.  Of the 27, seven (7) are due to qualify as pilots at the end of 2017.  In addition, an Air Corps Pilot Cadetship competition was launched on 22 March 2017, with a planned intake of up to 12 Cadets in the third quarter of this year.  However, it will take some time for cadets, when qualified, to develop their skills and expertise.  It is envisaged that a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps will be a gradual process and will be governed by the overarching requirements of safety. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of wider initiatives in place to address recruitment and retention across the Defence Forces.  One of the key policies supporting personnel retention is the opportunity for extensive personal and professional development offered by the Defence Forces through accredited courses, and the unique features of the military environment.  It is also the case that the extensive professional training they receive makes them very attractive within the private sector.
