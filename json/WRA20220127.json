The Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic, notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service. Despite the disruptions related to the pandemic throughout last year, the Passport Service issued over 634,000 passports in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issued within one business day. <\/p><p>The Passport Service has been experiencing very high demand for passports since May 2021 and expects a high level of demand for passports to continue throughout this year. The Passport Service has put several measures in place to meet this anticipated demand. The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. A particular improvement that will be of interest to Deputies is a change to the documentary management process that reduces the turnaround time when additional documents need to be submitted by the applicant. <\/p><p>In addition, my Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels.  A significant number of additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service throughout January, February and March. I am confident that these additional staff will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for first time and renewal passports in 2022.<\/p><p>In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.<\/p><p>The current passport processing times are:<\/p><p>- 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p><p>- 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p><p>- 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online<\/p><p>- 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p><p>There are currently 100,000 online applications and 13,000 paper applications on hand with the Passport Service.  The passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provide all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport. Passport Service figures show that 45% of current applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications, the processing time is 40 working days.<\/p><p>There are currently 30,000 first time child applications on hand with the Passport Service. Of these, almost 13,000 or 43% are incomplete applications that require additional documentation from the applicants&rsquo; guardians in order to complete the application and ensure that the child&rsquo;s passport can be issued.<\/p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The processing of an online application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. <\/p><p>Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age  both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.<\/p><p>I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply in plenty of time. In the case of people planning to travel this year, whose passports are already out of date or who have children who are first-time applicants, I would encourage them to apply now online.<\/p><p>The table below outlines the number of complete online passport applications currently on hand with the Passport Service by county. <\/p><p><b>Online passport applications with Passport Service by county<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>CARLOW <\/th>       <th>254 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CAVAN <\/td>       <td>306 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CLARE <\/td>       <td>429 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK <\/td>       <td>2,591 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DONEGAL <\/td>       <td>557 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DUBLIN <\/td>       <td>6,813 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>GALWAY <\/td>       <td>1,060 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KERRY <\/td>       <td>586 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KILDARE <\/td>       <td>1,155 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KILKENNY <\/td>       <td>372 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LAOIS <\/td>       <td>345 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LEITRIM <\/td>       <td>115 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LIMERICK <\/td>       <td>883 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LONGFORD <\/td>       <td>143 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>LOUTH <\/td>       <td>653 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MAYO <\/td>       <td>497 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MEATH <\/td>       <td>1,013 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MONAGHAN <\/td>       <td>215 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>OFFALY <\/td>       <td>261 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>ROSCOMMON <\/td>       <td>201 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SLIGO <\/td>       <td>267 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TIPPERARY <\/td>       <td>585 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>WATERFORD <\/td>       <td>549 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>WESTMEATH <\/td>       <td>361 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>WEXFORD <\/td>       <td>609 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>WICKLOW <\/td>       <td>696 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":54,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB01950"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[3295\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the discussions he or his officials have had recently with the British and Northern Ireland authorities in relation to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements; the progress being made to create a stable, violence free society there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[3906\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed   the need to implement in full the Good Friday Agreement with the political parties in Stormont; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 26 together.<\/p><p>The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement and all subsequent agreements is a central priority for this Government. The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.<\/p><p>  The Peace Process has succeeded over the last two decades in moving definitively beyond the violence of the Troubles. However, it is an ongoing process and the work of peace requires a consistent commitment and renewed efforts in the face of new challenges. Since the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, it has been necessary to pursue a series of successive further political and legal agreements to consolidate the peace settlement provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>Most recently of course, the New Decade New Approach Agreement, reached in January 2020, restored the devolved institutions after a three year absence. The Government is committed to working in support of the full implementation of the NDNA, and the fulfilment of our own commitments made alongside the agreement. An NDNA implementation review meeting is planned to take place in the period immediately ahead, which will provide opportunity to discuss the status of those commitments.<\/p><p>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government has continued to work closely on a North\/South and East\/West basis in support of the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland, through the mechanisms provided for the Good Friday Agreement, including the North South Ministerial Council, the British Irish Council (BIC) and the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference. (BIIGC).<\/p><p>The most recent BIIGC took place on 2 December in London. In this format, both Governments discussed a broad range of topics relating to Northern Ireland, including the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements. I have also continued to engage regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and with the leaders of the parties in Northern Ireland, as we work to ensure progress, stability and address pressing challenges, including the outworkings of Brexit and the legacy of the Troubles. <\/p><p>A Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is a central provision of the GFA. An Ad-Hoc Assembly Committee has been established, and the Committee published its research paper in March 2020, and launched a public consultation in May. The Government remains firmly committed to the provision of a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>All parties to the GFA recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity, which in Northern Ireland includes the Irish language, Ulster-Scots and the languages of the various ethnic communities.  There is now a commitment in place from the British Government to legislate to implement the relevant provisions of the NDNA agreement if the Northern Ireland Assembly fails to do so.<\/p><p>Progress has also been made regarding the Government&rsquo;s commitments supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland, including the allocation of: &euro;3m as part of the commitment in Budget 2021 for Irish language broadcasting; &euro;1.8m over three years (2020-22) to support the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and an All Island expansion of existing Irish Language Network strategy.  <\/p><p>The Government continues to support the establishment of a dedicated structure for civic engagement by the Northern Ireland Executive as set out in the Good Friday Agreement under Strand One. In the NDNA agreement, it was agreed that the Compact Civic Advisory Panel would be reformed to propose the most appropriate model for civic engagement on specific issues.<\/p><p>The Government also continues to support the establishment of the North South Consultative Forum, as provided for under Strand Two of the GFA, and has worked to move the issue forward, submitting proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive for its consideration. We have also raised the issue at successive plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the Reconciliation Fund, administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, continues to support the vital work of peace and reconciliation. The budget of the Reconciliation Fund will increase to &euro;5.0 million this year, with these funds playing an important role to aiding a wide range of projects and organisations to carry out their impactful work across communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Diplomatic Relations","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02250"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[3884\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the current state of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Ethiopia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s partnership with Ethiopia is longstanding - our Embassy in Addis Ababa opened in 1994 and Ethiopia has been our largest bilateral development partner in the last five years. <\/p>  <p>  The situation in Tigray and in other parts of northern Ethiopia since the outbreak of the conflict in late 2020 is of grave concern.

I have also maintained contact with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s business community with regard to the Protocol and last met virtually with business leaders on 11 November.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to engage closely with the First Minister, deputy First Minister, other political, religious, civil society, and business leaders in Northern Ireland as we move forward, and look forward to increased visits there as the public health context allows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":64,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 23.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02750"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[3887\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the measures that Ireland is taking on the United Nations Security Council and within the European Union to ensure that steps are taken to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe occurring in Afghanistan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[3907\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the role the United Nations is taking to protect citizens and their rights in Afghanistan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 58 together.<\/p><p>Ireland remains active in discussions on Afghanistan both at EU level and at the UN Security Council, where it has featured regularly on the agenda since the Taliban takeover in August 2021. <\/p><p>Promoting human rights and the protection of civilians are key priorities for Ireland on the Security Council. We have consistently advocated for Afghan women and girls, who must be treated as equal citizens, with rights to full and equal access to education, to healthcare, to freedom of movement and participation in public life.  We have emphasised the need to maintain humanitarian access to address what is now the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. Ireland strongly supported UN Security Council Resolution 2615, adopted on 22 December 2021, which exempts humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan from UN sanctions against members of the Taliban.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s approach is consistent with the EU Council Conclusions on Afghanistan of September 2021, to which we contributed and which highlight the effect of the Taliban actions on civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights, and on the gains made over the last two decades, which had been supported by the EU. Among the guiding principles agreed by the EU are that the Taliban must respect the independence of humanitarian operations and guarantee safe and unhindered access for all humanitarian staff, including all female staff, and that they must promote, protect and respect all human rights, in particular the full enjoyment of rights of women and girls. <\/p><p>I remain gravely concerned at the deteriorating human rights situation in Afghanistan.  The continued absence of many non-governmental organisations, civil society networks, and diplomatic missions from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover has made the role of the UN in monitoring and reporting on developments inside Afghanistan, especially on human rights, more important than ever before.  Representatives of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) have met regularly with high-ranking members of the Taliban administration to highlight Afghanistan&rsquo;s human rights obligations under international law. The mandate for UNAMA is due to be renewed by the UN Security Council by 17 March. Ireland will advocate strongly for the maintenance of human rights tasks in that mandate, to operate in tandem with the implementation of last October&rsquo;s<i><\/i>EU-led resolution at the UN Human Rights Council on the &ldquo;Situation of human rights in Afghanistan&rdquo;, which establishes a mandate for a Special Rapporteur, to be appointed at the March 2022 session.<\/p><p>The UN launched a funding appeal on 11 January, seeking approximately $5 billion to meet the emergency humanitarian needs within Afghanistan and of Afghan refugees in the region.  This is the largest such humanitarian appeal ever issued by the UN.  Since the Taliban seizure of power, the EU and its Member States have allocated more than &euro;1 billion in funding to UN agencies and NGOs working in Afghanistan, for both humanitarian aid and for supporting basic needs (&lsquo;humanitarian plus&rsquo;). The EU also established a humanitarian air bridge that in 2021 delivered 280 tonnes of lifesaving medication, food and equipment to address COVID-19 to Afghanistan.  <\/p><p>In addition, the Government through its Development Assistance programme, Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;4 million in humanitarian support for the people of Afghanistan since mid-August. This funding has been allocated to the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and UNICEF. These emergency response programmes are addressing the urgent needs of the population, including providing food aid, treatment for severe acute malnutrition in children, and other essential services. Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian funding to Afghanistan increased fivefold in 2021 to over &euro;5 million &ndash; with the remainder provided at the beginning of the year to Concern Worldwide, HALO Trust and the AHF.<\/p><p>In addition, Ireland contributes to support global funds and provide core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Afghanistan, including the EU, WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021, providing &euro;11 million. Since August, the CERF has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[3877\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700073#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the European Union  and United Nations position on the massing of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine; if the international community is sufficiently committed to protecting the interests of Ukraine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>Ireland has strongly and consistently supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine as I have conveyed personally to Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on a number of occasions over the past year.

The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is a matter of great concern. It is important that dialogue be maintained, with the primary goal of de-escalating tensions in the region. In this regard, I welcome the intensive diplomatic efforts which have occurred in recent weeks, aimed at defusing tensions. These include bilateral discussions between the US and Russia, between NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. As a participating State in the OSCE, Ireland is pleased to express solidarity with Ukraine and seek a peaceful de-escalation of tensions in that forum.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the last year, the EU has dedicated significant time to the situation in Ukraine, not least at the Foreign Affairs Council. The EU has been and will remain united in extending solidarity to Ukraine and condemning Russian aggression. I commend Ukraine it on its resilience and restraint in the face of continued Russian aggression. The latest build-up of troops near Ukraine has caused a sustained period of heightened tension over recent weeks and months.  This has been exacerbated by Russia's security proposals which attempt to impinge on Ukraine's sovereign right as a nation to decide its own defence and external association policy. <\/p>  <p>  I and my fellow EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation again on Monday of this week at the Foreign Affairs Council of 24 January. That discussion built on our detailed exchange at the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in Brest on 13 and 14 January hosted by the French Presidency. In my own remarks, I have consistently underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU. <\/p>  <p>  EU leaders including the Taoiseach, at the European Council in December, clearly stated that any further military aggression against Ukraine will have massive consequences and severe cost in response. This has been reinforced in the Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions of 24 January, which state that preparatory work has accelerated on restrictive measures in case of further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine.  <\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers on Monday continued to emphasise the need for de-escalation and the prevention of further conflict in Ukraine. This is the outcome we want to see. Too many lives have already been lost in the conflict in Ukraine and we must always keep open the path of dialogue. This is why we and our EU partners view the Minsk Agreements as so important.  Their full implementation remains the best avenue to achieve peace in Ukraine. The OSCE as a platform for regional security has also featured heavily in our recent discussions. The OSCE is the body that brings all parties in the region to the table and I am in favour of the EU continuing to invest significant effort there.<\/p>  <p>  However, I and my counterparts also acknowledged that the EU must be willing to meet unacceptable behaviour from Russia with consequences. We cannot continue to do business with Russia as normal if it perpetrates further military aggression against Ukraine. This is why we have agreed to signal that preparatory work on restrictive measures has accelerated. We hope that this work won't be needed. We hope it won't come to that. But we need to be prepared to use the leverage we have in the interests of peace and security on the continent.<\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers have also engaged with Ukraine directly, to ensure that its voice is heard and that we understand its perspective. This includes engagements with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. I discussed these matters in person with Minister Kuleba when I travelled to Kyiv on 23 August to represent Ireland at the International Crimea Platform, a diplomatic initiative by Ukraine to seek a peaceful end to the illegal Russian occupation of the peninsula.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700074#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":106,"content":"<p>Question No. 42 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700074#WRC00650"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[3538\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700074#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the proposed timeframe to honour the Government commitment to recognise the state of Palestine.","asker":"1451","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":109,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[3914\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700074#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of plans to officially recognise the state of Palestine pursuant to the Programme for Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":110,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear in my engagement with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority of the commitment of this Government to advancing a two-State solution, in line with the agreed parameters for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has pledged to honour our commitment to recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-state solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory.<\/p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, in the absence of progress towards a two-State solution, I would be prepared to recommend to the Government early recognition by Ireland of a State of Palestine, if and when it might be helpful, and this is a matter which I discuss regularly with EU colleagues. <\/p>  <p>  Recognition by Ireland outside the context of an overall peace agreement would, however, be likely to affect Ireland&rsquo;s influence on the Israel-Palestine conflict at EU and international level.

This includes COVID-19 specific response measures, and ongoing work to strengthen health systems for the prevention and treatment of pre-existing conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Experience from Irish Aid&rsquo;s engagement in the fight against HIV and Ebola demonstrates the importance of effective public health systems.

It is estimated that total production of vaccines will reach 19 billion by July. On 16 January, a shipment of vaccines to Rwanda included the billionth dose supplied via the COVAX facility. However, as long as a significant proportion of the world&rsquo;s population remains unvaccinated and without full access to testing, tracking and treatment, COVID-19 will remain a threat to lives and livelihoods.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, I announced an additional Irish contribution of &euro;5 million to COVAX at a Gavi event. This brings Ireland&rsquo;s overall contribution to COVAX to date to &euro;13.5 million. This supports the purchase and distribution of vaccines in lower income countries. Ireland was one of the first donors to agree to cover the additional costs associated with donations of vaccines via the facility. The recent additional funding to COVAX will contribute to those costs, the financing of vaccines, and support to country readiness, such as the provision of equipment and technical support to boost vaccine rollout.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has received approval from Government to donate up to 5 million surplus vaccines to developing countries, largely through the COVAX facility. To date, more than 1.3 million of these doses have been delivered to countries including Nigeria, Ghana and Indonesia, with more expected. Further donations are expected in the coming weeks. The Department of Health, working closely with DFA, also facilitated the bilateral donation of 335,000 AstraZeneca doses to Uganda, specifically targeted to the vaccination of teachers to enable the reopening of schools.

The GDPR also increases the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations.  The accompanying Law Enforcement Directive (the Directive) was transposed into national law at the same time as the GDPR. The Directive establishes data protection standards for the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries is carried out under a number of transfer mechanisms set out in Chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The default transfer mechanism is known as  an &lsquo;adequacy decision&rsquo;, this is an implementing decision by the Commission which guarantees that the third country in question provides an equivalent level of protection of personal data as exists in the EU. Once a third country has been assessed by the Commission as providing an equivalent level of protection, transfers of EU citizen&rsquo;s data can take place between the EU and the selected third country under that adequacy decision, without limitation or additional safeguards.<\/p>  <p>  A new arrangement with the EU-US in regard to safe transfers of data is an outcome we want to see achieved. This is critical for business certainty but also for the successful operation of the GDPR. The Government respects the judgment of the European Court and in regards to the Schrems II case is fully supportive of the need to protect citizens&rsquo; data through enforceable safeguards and for proper redress mechanisms. <\/p>  <p>  Any future adequacy decision must work for both the EU and US in facilitating data transfers. It must also critically be able to pass any future scrutiny of the European Court of Justice.

Funding towards development research, such as the SDG Challenge Fund in partnership with Science Foundation Ireland, is focused on research solutions to intractable SDG challenges.

In addition to these partnerships, the Defence Forces operates a refund of fees scheme that facilitates personnel in accessing partial funding to pay for courses in which they are engaged in their own time. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Policy on Specific Learning Difficulties (SLDs) provides information for Defence Forces training establishments, students and instructors on the supports available to personnel with SLDs. Guidance is available on disclosure, screening, teaching strategies, assistive technologies and assessment supports to be utilised. The Defence Forces has trained a number of Officers and Non Commissioned Officers as Student Liaison Officers to assist in the provision of these supports to personnel across the Defence Forces through the completion of a Level 9 Programme in Adult Guidance and Counselling. Defence Forces personnel are also supported to access further and higher education programmes through Recognition of Prior Learning and Work Based Learning Portfolios. These mechanisms allow access to programmes through non-traditional methods.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has recently published its first formal Professional Military Education Strategy, covering the period 2021 to 2024. It builds on the Professional Military Education framework previously developed for Officer Ranks, as well as the annual Training and Education Directive.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of the Professional Military Education strategy is to develop and maintain military capability by building on existing Professional Military Education concepts, incorporating 'best practice' approaches as utilised by other international military academies, Partner Nations, and national Higher Level Institutes in order to develop a future framework that clearly defines Defence Forces educational and career pathways, while also enabling an effective and progressive approach to the delivery of Defence Forces Education and Training needs. It will assist in ensuring that the Defence Forces attract, develop and retain high quality personnel and will underpin the capacity of the Defence Forces to fulfil the roles assigned by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700077#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[3898\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700077#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the position regarding the Commission on the Defence Forces report; when this report is expected to be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Members of the Commission also conducted site visits to military locations across the country, meeting nearly 1,000 military personnel.

The MSPC owes its origins to the decision of the Oireachtas of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann in June 1923 to recognise and compensate wounded members, and the widows, children and dependents of deceased members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, including the National Forces, the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Republican Army and the Irish Citizen Army through the payment of allowances and gratuities.  Over time, provision was enhanced and broadened to include members of the Hibernian Rifles, Cumann na mBan, Fianna &Eacute;ireann and certain members of the Connaught Rangers.  Two streams of legislation are relevant to the material in the collection:<\/p><p>- The Army Pensions Acts from 1923 to 1953<\/p><p>- The Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924, 1934 and 1949. <\/p><p>The MSPC project is mandated to preserve and make available the files and records of the Department of Defence dealing with the service of qualifying members of these organisations from the period April 1916 to the 30<sup>th<\/sup>of September 1923. This involves cataloguing and digitising in the region of 275,000 files.<\/p><p>To date, there has been eleven releases of material under the MSPC project, the latest release was in November 2021.  Since the first release of material in 2014, more than 108,000 files have been individually catalogued by the MSPC team, with over 38,000 scanned files currently fully downloadable online. All releases of records from MSPC and the online resources are hosted on the Military Archives Website ().  <\/p><p>The Military Service Pension Collection (MSPC) has been key to some of the most dynamic recent research on the Irish revolutionary period and the records contained in the collection provide invaluable historical information that captures first-hand accounts of the experiences of the individuals involved in this defining period of Irish history.  Each release of material from this collection reveals previously unknown or forgotten experiences of those involved in events of that time. The continued digitisation and release of material from this collection presents the public with the opportunity to research information about their ancestors and their community during the period leading up to the establishment of Irish independence.<\/p><p>Looking forward, the MSPC project will continue to digitise and release additional material.  For 2022, it is planned that two further releases of material will take place during the year and planning is underway for a third publication from the MSPC Project.At present, it is expected that this planned publication will be ready for release in Quarter 4 of this year.  <\/p><p>The records in the MSPC are an important source for the history of the twentieth century Ireland as a whole and the planned  publication will further explore the collection and consider the role of the collection into the future.  Since the first release of material from this extensive historical collection it is clear that the records capture aspects of the lived experience in twentieth century Ireland and the collection contains many thousands of otherwise unrecorded voices. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700077#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700077#WRF03050"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[3631\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700077#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the steps he is taking to improve reporting mechanisms for Defence Forces personnel experiencing sexual abuse, harassment and bullying.

In previous years, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, such pay savings were reallocated to address spending pressures elsewhere in the Defence Vote subheads and across the Defence Sector.  However in 2021, similar to many other Public Service organisations, the continued impact of Covid-19 and supply chain difficulties has limited the extent to which my Department was able to re-direct these savings. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding these difficulties, there was significant capital spending of over &euro;129 million in 2021 on the ongoing upgrade and replacement of essential military equipment and the development of the Defence Forces built infrastructure. This level of expenditure, despite huge Covid-19 and other supply chain challenges, highlights my commitment to ensuring the Defence Forces have the capabilities necessary to enable them to fulfil all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas. Additionally, for 2022, the provision of the significant funding allocation of over &euro;1.1 billion emphasises this Government ongoing commitment to the Defence Sector.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020.

It is envisaged that the Strategic Compass will set out policy orientations and specific goals and objectives in areas such as crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships.  EU Member States have, over the last number of years, worked together on its further development with the adoption of a finalised version of the Compass expected in March of this year. <\/p>  <p>  The first draft of the Strategic Compass was presented by HRVP Borrell to Foreign and Defence Ministers in a joint session of the Foreign Affairs Council in Foreign Affairs and Defence format on 15th November 2021.

Once agreed by all Member States, this policy document will serve to guide the EU&rsquo;s approach towards CSDP for the next decade, while also reflecting the increasingly complex security landscape faced by the EU. There are many proposals within the Strategic Compass which may lead to tangible future initiatives, but these remain under discussion by all Member States and are yet to be agreed. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). <\/p>  <p>  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we welcome the Strategic Compass as a means of setting out our shared strategic vision as a Union for the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and of enhancing the role of the EU as a security provider that can contribute effectively to international peace and security.<\/p>  <p>  In my view, the Strategic Compass also offers an important opportunity for the EU to project its values.  In my discussions with other Member States, I have therefore suggested that the starting point for the Compass, should be the core values that underpin our approach to CSDP, including our collective commitment to effective multilateralism and the rules-based international order. In this regard, the exercise offers an excellent opportunity to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s cooperation with the United Nations, including in the areas of peacekeeping and crisis management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700078#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700078#WRG01850"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[3294\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700078#WRG01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of non-commissioned members and commissioned officers of the Defence Forces that have retired or resigned in each of the past five years; the progress made to date in addressing the pay issues in the Defence Forces which has led to an exodus of members from the forces; when a decision will be made on the application by an organisation (details supplied) to affiliate with another organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>There are many reasons why individuals leave the Defence Forces, which includes: retirement on reaching mandatory age limits, completion of service, individual personal circumstances, other career opportunities, ill health, failure to meet fitness and medical standards, etc.  <\/p><p>Discharge figures, outlined in the table below, details the number of non-commissioned members and commissioned officers of the Defence Forces that have retired or resigned, in each of the past five years.

In the context of addressing and indeed tackling these challenges, Ireland is a committed multilateralist and greatly values the contribution that we can, and do make, through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700078#WRG03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700078#WRG03450"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[3293\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700078#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if consideration is been given to using Galway Port along with D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa, An Rinn Mh&oacute;r, Gaillimh as a base for the Naval Service in the west of Ireland in view of its central location on the west coast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be interested to note that there is currently a programme of infrastructure works taking place at the Naval Base in Haulbowline with the objective of increasing the berthage capacity in the Dockyard Basin at Haulbowline to meet the requirements of the Naval Service fleet. <\/p><p>This programme of works includes:<\/p><p>--Upgrading of Spencer Jetty- works at an advanced stage and due for completion in the coming weeks at an estimated cost of &euro;2.7m;<\/p><p>--Dredging of the Graving Dock- sampling and analysis is currently underway with the main dredgingworks expected following on from same at an estimated cost of &euro;2.5m excl VAT;<\/p><p>--Further development of the West Wall to facilitate additional berthage.<\/p><p>My Department has not been advised of any current operational requirements for the use of Galway Port as a base for the Naval Service.

As part of this project the Department of Transport convened an inter-Departmental\/Agency Steering Group of which both the Department of Defence and the Air Corps were members. <\/p><p>A strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal document in line with the Public Service Code was brought to Government for information in July 2020. This preliminary appraisal, which included an appraisal of various service delivery options, was compiled by the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Project Team in conjunction with KPMG, and was shared with the Steering Group before going to Government in summer 2020. The preliminary work included an appraisal of the options of the State assuming full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated Irish Coast Guard Aviation Branch. Both options were ruled out for a variety of reasons but notably the risks to the State and questions around potential affordability and deliverability.  <\/p><p>I agreed with the strategic assessment and preliminary appraisal and I confirmed then, as I do again now, that I did not see the Air Corps taking full responsibility for search and Rescue (SAR) aviation services in Ireland&rsquo;s SAR domain.

The option which included the Air Corps providing an element of the helicopter and fixed wing SAR service did not emerge as the preferred option. <\/p><p>In July 2021, the Government agreed to commence the formal procurement process for a new Coast Guard aviation service.

The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders.

The purpose of this scheme is to prevent hardship by providing income-tested financial support to people whose homes are damaged from flooding and severe weather events and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and structural repair. <\/p><p>- The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment operates the humanitarian support scheme for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies provides assistance to those affected by flooding.  The scheme provides a one-off emergency humanitarian support contribution (max. &euro;20,000) towards the costs of returning business premises&rsquo; to their pre-flood condition including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock. <\/p><p>- The Department of Rural and Community Development has developed a draft Framework Proposal for Community Resilience within Major Emergency Management.  The draft Framework explores the potential additional support structure that can be built into existing response plans, facilitating greater co-operation and understanding at a local level while providing the potential for extra resources if, and when, required.  <\/p><p>- The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is designated as the Lead Government Department with responsibility for severe weather events including flooding.

This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.<b><\/b>Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term.

As a committed signatory to the Call for Action on the Protection of Women from Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Conflict, Ireland is a leading voice in ensuring that every humanitarian response from the outset includes the policies, systems and mechanisms necessary to prevent and mitigate GBV. Furthermore, through a Strategic Partnership with the International Rescue Committee, Ireland funds life-saving services for women and girl survivors of GBV in five of the most protracted, underfunded humanitarian settings in Africa &ndash; South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Burundi.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also actively engaged in the work of the Security Council&rsquo;s Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, and its efforts to protect children in situations of conflict.

Ireland has also ensured that the voices of Sudan&rsquo;s leading women&rsquo;s rights activists are heard in these discussions. Ireland used its platform as president of the Council in September 2021 to call for all UN Member States to enable women and youth to play an active part in the implementation of peace agreements to ensure durability of peace in Sudan and other conflict-affected countries throughout the world. In fact, during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council in September, sixteen of seventeen civil society briefers were women, a new record for women&rsquo;s participation at the Council. Ireland also supports the work of Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), a coalition of women&rsquo;s rights activists working to advance the rights of, and address violence against, women and girls in the Horn of Africa.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Belarus, in 2021, Ireland allocated &euro;100,000 to the IFRC to support the Lithuania Red Cross&rsquo; response to the migrant crisis on the Lithuania-Belarus border. In addition, the IFRC launched an operation through their Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to assist refugees in Lithuania. Ireland is a regular contributor to the DREF and contributed &euro;1 million to this fund in 2021. IFRC has been supporting extremely vulnerable people at the border, including women, persons with disabilities and children &ndash; many of them without a parent or guardian. In October 2021, my colleague Minister of State Byrne visited the Lithuanian-Belarussian border, accompanied by members of the Lithuanian Government. In November 2021, Ireland requested, along with EU member states France and Estonia, that the UNSC hold an AOB discussion on Belarus, focused on the ongoing migration issue.

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries and are concerned at both the increasing disillusionment with the enlargement process in the Western Balkans and the resultant decline in public perception of the EU in the region.<\/p>  <p>  For this reason, it was welcome that the Declaration adopted at the EU-Western Balkans Summit last October contained a clear signal of the continuing priority afforded by the EU to the Enlargement dossier and to achieving early progress in advancing the accession process. <\/p>  <p>  There are five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and Serbia. Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  The European Commission presented Member States with the main findings and recommendations of the seven country reports on 19 October in last year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Enlargement Package&rsquo;. This was followed up with the agreement of Council Conclusions on the Enlargement and Stabilisation and Association Process in December. While situations vary from country to country, limited progress in the enlargement process overall was noted due to both the impact of the pandemic and ongoing delays and blockages in the enlargement process. <\/p>  <p>  While technically remaining the two front-runners in terms of EU accession, there is general agreement within both Council and Commission that both Serbia and Montenegro need to increase the dynamism in their reform agenda. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms regarding fundamental rights and the rule of law, and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. A recent positive development has been the holding of a referendum on 16 January which saw a number of amendments to the Serbian constitution relating to the judiciary system approved. In Montenegro, more intensive efforts in relation to freedom of expression, media freedom and the fight against corruption and organised crime are required. We have called for intensified dialogue among all parties in Montenegro to address those issues currently giving rise to tensions within the country<\/p>  <p>  Both North Macedonia and Albania have clearly fulfilled the conditions necessary to commence accession negotiations. In our view, shared almost unanimously within the Council, the negotiating frameworks for both countries should be agreed and Intergovernmental Conferences held as soon as possible to start the accession process. We continue to advocate for this at EU meetings and working groups. <\/p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2021 noted that the political situation there remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has clearly set out the fourteen priority areas for reform which need to be progressed, if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to advance on its European path. We call on all parties and leaders within Bosnia and Herzegovina to avoid further delay in progressing this urgent reform agenda, including in the areas of electoral and constitutional law.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU. It is our firm belief that it is through EU membership that peace and security can best be ensured throughout the Western Balkans. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700083#WRM01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700083#WRM01900"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[4178\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700083#WRM02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the international community continues to monitor the activities of the Boko Haram and Al Shabaab or associated organisations with a view to minimising and eliminating their ability to carry out attacks on women, young girls or children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>I strongly condemn the continued violence perpetrated by Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, support work of the EU and UN to reduce their influence, and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians and humanitarian workers and facilities. <\/p>  <p>  Through Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, my Department is tackling poverty, hunger and exclusion, which can be drivers of support for groups such as Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab, as well as responding to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict.

In the Sahel, Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger. 14 Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).

The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy in Myanmar that has taken years to establish. <\/p><p>On 6 December 2021 State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was sentenced by a military court; an additional sentence was imposed on 10 January 2022.

Ireland has joined statements by the European Union and the United Nations Security Council expressing deep concern at the sentencing of Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and others. The court proceedings appear to be an attempt to exclude Aung San Suu Kyi and democratically elected leaders from future political engagement and the inclusive dialogue process called for by ASEAN.  Ireland condemns these politically motivated verdicts and believes they represent another step towards the dismantling of the rule of law and a violation of human rights in Myanmar. <\/p><p>Ireland is actively engaged on the crisis in Myanmar in the context of our role on the United Nations Security Council and through the EU. The situation in Myanmar has been considered seven times by the Security Council since the coup, most recently on 8 November 2021. The Council has condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained.  The united voice of the Security Council on the situation in Myanmar is welcome, sending a clear message to the Myanmar military.<\/p><p>Ireland has also voiced its concern at four sessions of the Human Rights Council since February 2021 and has consistently supported international efforts towards ensuring accountability and justice, including through the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p>Ireland supports the EU's adoption of the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them and endorses the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on February 22 2021.

Under this &lsquo;fast accrual&rsquo; pension scheme, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. <\/p><p>Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;9.21 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years&rsquo; service.  This gives a maximum additional increment of &euro;92.10 weekly. However, under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable if and when the pensioner reaches the prescribed age for the State Pension (Contributory), that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on a person&rsquo;s date of birth. <\/p><p>These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, such as the State Pension (Contributory).  <\/p><p><i>Integration <\/i>means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of their occupational pension payable. In an integrated pension scheme, the State Pension or similar contributory Social Welfare benefit is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. <\/p><p>It might be noted that the method of integration for these &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is in fact more favourable than in other areas of the public service.  In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the occupational pension commences payment, for example from age 60\/65 where &lsquo;standard accrual&rsquo; pensions apply in pre-2013 public service schemes.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of State Pension payable (&euro;253.30 a week currently if under age 80) is considerably more than any reduction that could happen under the Defence Forces pension schemes by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension.  This is the scenario for any former member who retires with between 22 and 31 years&rsquo; service under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme.<\/p><p>The foregoing atypical integration arrangements do not apply to NCOs and Privates enlisting on or after 1 April 2004, and whose occupational pensions are subject to standard integration with social insurance benefits along with other public service employees insured for full PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Exercises","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN00700"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[4134\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he and or the Defence Forces staff met with Russian officials, diplomats or military staff in respect of Russian plans to conduct artillery drills off the coast of this jurisdiction (details supplied); and if so, if he will publish minutes and or memos attached to those meetings.","asker":"1489","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>I have not met with any Russian officials, diplomats or military staff in relation to plans for Russian naval exercises off the south-west coast of Ireland in early February.

While the main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks in tandem with maritime surveillance, and as such any Naval Service patrol should be viewed as a multi-faceted activity. <\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using the two CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish EEZ.<\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service and the Air Corps provide assistance and support to search and rescue missions on an as available basis, however, the lead agency for search and rescue (SAR) in Ireland's SAR domain is the Irish Coast Guard.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of fishery protection the Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the EEZ.

Approval in principle has been received for a number of relevant projects, including projects specifically linked to Naval Service and Air Corps capabilities and operations.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also begun discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to investigate the possibility of securing additional future funding to support Naval Service and Air Corps operations under the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF) 2021 &ndash; 2027. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland  is currently involved in an European Defence Agency project named Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) Networking - Operations Support &amp;amp; Development (MARSUR III). This is the third iteration of the MARSUR projects. The main objective of the EDA Maritime Surveillance programme is to further develop a Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) exchange network amongst Member States. An RMP is a picture or map that shows all vessels and activities that are present in a particular maritime area.  It links to national and international data and information on vessels, the marine environment, infrastructure etc. that has been compiled from various monitoring and surveillance systems. The MARSUR Project continues to enhance, upgrade and develop the capability for participating Member States to share different levels of classified information across the network.<\/p>  <p>  The MARSUR projects have assisted Member States, including Ireland, to combat drug trafficking, smuggling, illegal immigration and migration and international terrorism.  Better exchange of information plays an important part in protecting maritime trade, the maritime environment and natural resources.    <\/p>  <p>  As a committed EU Member State, Ireland supports fully the efforts of EU Member States to improve the Union's capacity to respond to the prevailing challenging security environment, including in the area of defence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":620,"content":"<p>Question No. 248 answered with Question No. 247.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":621,"content":"<p>Question No. 249 answered with Question No. 246.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service","counter":622,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN02100"},{"type":"question","counter":623,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[4191\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the steps in hand or being taken to ensure the availability for service of all Naval Service vessels at all times; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":624,"content":"<p>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles.

The ARM E ensures that all maintenance is carried out in accordance with manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations, and in adherence to industry best standards. Maintenance schedules are planned in so far as possible with a view to maximising fleet availability. <\/p>  <p>  The aircraft are made available in accordance with scheduled operations and non-scheduled operations.

While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the previous level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 Pandemic, the strategic use of State aircraft ensured the continuity of operations, both domestically and overseas, which had been impacted by the worldwide restrictions on civilian air transport services. In 2020, the Air Corps utilised fixed wing assets to conduct over 125 military transport missions involving the movement of Defence Force personnel (incl. MEDEVAC), equipment and  PPE to Defence Overseas missions with a further increase in Air Corps flights in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft.

The cost of the contract including ancillary support is &euro;229m inclusive of VAT. In addition to the principal role of maritime surveillance, particularly fishery protection, the aircraft will also enable the Air Corps to provide a wide range of services including logistics support and transport of troops and equipment, medical evacuation and air ambulance, search and rescue and a general utility role.<\/p>  <p>  This significant investment in maritime patrol aircraft is an example which demonstrates my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN02700"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[4193\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700084#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the recruitment of women to the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps continues to receive attention; if the numbers responding is indicative of an awareness of the need to ensure adequate gender balance in the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":630,"content":"<p>It is Government policy to increase female participation rates at all levels of the Defence Forces in order to increase capability and to better reflect the society from which the Defence Forces are drawn and serve. <\/p><p>As of 31 December 2021, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) stood at 8,468 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) personnel.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including referencing the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.<\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  The new first national training course for SNAs provided by UCD now in place aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Department has been engaging in that process. <\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority and the Department's circular 36\/2020 and 51\/2019 sets out the current educational requirements for appointment as a Special Needs Assistant (SNA). In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position.

Stapolin Educate Together NS (primary)<\/p><p>2.  Belmayne Educate Together SS (post primary)<\/p><p>3.  Gaelscoil Ghr&aacute;inne Mhaol (primary) (under the patronage of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta)<\/p><p>All three schools are multi-denominational in ethos.<\/p><p>Additionally, there are projects planned and in train at Grange Community College and Gaelchol&aacute;iste Reachrainn, both under the patronage of Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, which are providing additional multi-denominational post primary school places in the area.  <\/p><p>Further to this, the Schools Recon?guration for Diversity process, supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families, has been developed in order to accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational schools across the country.<\/p><p>This Reconfiguration process involves the transfer of existing schools as opposed to the amalgamation and\/or closure model of the patronage divesting process. The Department has been engaging with representatives of the Irish Episcopal Conference (Catholic bishops) as the majority patron of schools nationwide with a view to developing an agreed approach to the next phase of the process. School communities who wish to explore the potential to transfer patronage should contact their school patron in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700086#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":722,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700086#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":723,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[4207\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700086#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if   a standardisation model was used in the leaving certificate 2019; and if so, the detail of the process of standardisation used by the State Examinations Commission prior to subsequent calculated grades and accredited grade models of standardisation.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":724,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700086#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early School Leavers","counter":725,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700086#WRP01100"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[4209\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700086#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of early school leavers in each of the years 2018 to 2021, in tabular form; and the latest data available for 2022, by county.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":727,"content":"<p>Estimates of Early School Leavers (ESL) are arrived at by subtracting the number of students who sat the Leaving Certificate in 2019 or received a calculated grade in 2020 from the number of pupils who entered first year in the 2014-15 school year.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff \/ equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that work is underway to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended. The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.<\/p>  <p>  There are many, many individuals in our country who did so much during the pandemic. I and the Government is sincerely grateful for this commitment but it is appropriate that these public sector frontline healthcare workers get particular recognition. They exposed themselves to particular COVID-19 risks that did not exist in other work environments or those working from home. I am also deeply appreciative of all those frontline workers who worked in our nursing homes and hospices during this pandemic and that they also get similar recognition.<\/p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. I would encourage private healthcare companies that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":914,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS01700"},{"type":"question","counter":915,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[4062\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current waiting time for applications for a medical card; the number of persons awaiting a decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":916,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":917,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS02000"},{"type":"question","counter":918,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[4063\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons waiting on knee replacements in each hospital for 1, 2, 3 and 4 plus years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[4064\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700089#WRS02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons waiting on hip replacements in each hospital for 1, 2, 3 and 4 plus years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.<\/p><p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.<\/p><p>As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which included a period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work - in particular in Model 4 hospitals. Services are beginning to return to normal but elective procedures continue to be affected by staff absences due to Covid and emergency department pressures that are running above 2019 levels.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.<\/p><p>In addition, the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund.<\/p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p><p>The information requested by the deputy concerning hip\/knee replacements at each hospital in the

This funding allowed for the expansion of existing hub facilities and remote working infrastructure in digital hubs throughout the country. <\/p><p>I am currently reviewing all my Department&rsquo;s funding streams and I will make an announcement shortly on the plans for 2022. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012700090#WRT04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"}]
