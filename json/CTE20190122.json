I head up the income tax policy section.  I am joined this afternoon by my colleagues: Ms Deirdre Donaghy, principal officer, who leads one of the two corporation tax sections in the division; by Mr. Pat Leahy, principal officer, who heads up the capital taxes section of the division; and my colleague Mr. Keith Walsh, principal officer, who heads up the statistics and economics research branch of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners I would like to thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the Department's report on tax expenditures, which was published as part of the documentation for budget 2019, as well as the paper prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, entitled: Tax Expenditures in Ireland: Key Issues for Consideration, which was published in September of last year.<\/p> <p>  In 2008 and 2009, I was part of the secretariat which supported the Commission on Taxation, which reported to Government in 2009.  More specifically, I acted as secretary to the working group within the commission that examined the question of tax expenditures.  With other colleagues in the commission secretariat, I was directly involved in providing research and drafting support to the group and the commission.<\/p> <p>  As to an approach that might assist towards having a fruitful discussion this afternoon, and with the permission of the Chairman, I will focus in my remarks on the main conclusions and findings of the PBO paper.  Broadly speaking, we would support the perspective and views put forward by the PBO that tax expenditures represent a significant and non-trivial annual cost the Exchequer.  We also hold the view that, in general, the direct spending route should be the first port of call where the State wishes to support a particular activity and that tax expenditures should be seen as equivalent to direct public spending.  It follows from that then, that the processes related to accounting and accountability for tax expenditures might benefit from being more closely aligned with those on the direct spending side.<\/p> <p>  We also support, in principle, the view that there is scope for a more in-depth consideration of tax expenditures as part of the wider budget scrutiny process.  This point speaks to key messages 2, 3, and 4 put forward by the PBO in its paper.<\/p> <p>  Taking those messages in turn, on key message 2, costing of tax expenditures, the Department has no difficulty with the proposition that consideration might be given to alternative methods of estimating the cost of tax expenditures.  However, it should be noted that the OECD 2010 report, referenced by the PBO paper, notes in the context of its review of ten countries which did not include Ireland, that every country examined here has chosen the revenue foregone method, despite all its flaws.<\/p> <p>  The reason for this is almost certainly that the final revenue loss method is totally impractical.  The European Commission document \"Tax expenditures in direct taxation in EU Member States\", observes that member states most often use the revenue foregone method in their regular tax expenditure reporting.  Indeed, the PBO's own paper acknowledges the complexity of alternative approaches.  Limitations in the data may also prove an inhibitory factor in taking a revised approach.  This is not only because of trade-off considerations between seeking information from beneficiaries and the burden that may place on those beneficiaries, but also because there can be an absence of reliable base data upon which to base cost estimates.<\/p><p>The recent introduction of the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, a new incentive, is an example in this regard, where it was difficult to estimate the likely annual cost in advance.  Notwithstanding these points, we would have no difficulty in further examining how tax expenditures are costed.<\/p><p> Similarly, on key message 3, the Department would not disagree with the view that there is room for further improvement in access, availability and transparency of data on tax expenditures.  That said, it would be fair to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made in Ireland in this regard if we take as a starting point the work of the Commission on Taxation ten years ago, which sought to identify, codify and cost all the main tax expenditures in existence at the time.<\/p><p> Timing and placement of tax expenditure reports is key to ensuring transparency.  The OECD report of 2010 recommends that such reports should be published in the budget documents, which has been our practice to date.  The report also recommends that tax expenditures should be reported alongside outlay programmes with the same purpose.  A domestic example in this regard is the recent agri-taxation progress update report, which was published with the 2018 tax expenditures report, as part of budget 2019.  It specifically set out to map the direct and tax expenditure supports available to the agri-sector and presented both sets of data, from the period 2012 to 2016, alongside each other.  As acknowledged by the PBO paper, however, and in my comments earlier, there is a need to strike a balance between data transparency and the administrative burden this may place on taxpayers.<\/p><p> Revenue publishes costs and numbers of tax expenditures as part of its official statistics and open data releases, meaning that the methodologies used are validated against a set of statistical criteria reviewed with the Central Statistics Office and that they are made available in open and accessible formats.  Significant efforts have been made by Revenue to provide greater detail on the distribution of certain tax expenditures.  For example, it publishes detailed reports on the help-to-buy incentive and the recently discontinued home renovation incentive, giving information on geographical spread, the numbers of individuals availing of different quantums of relief and so on.  It also publishes an annual farming profile which analyses the relief availed of by the agri-sector under a number of different tax heads - value added tax, capital acquisitions tax, stamp duty, etc.<\/p><p> On key message 4, systematic review and evaluation, the Department would again have no difficulty in supporting the principle of a systematic approach to the routine review of tax expenditures.  Such an approach is set out in the Department&rsquo;s tax expenditure guidelines, developed and published in 2014.  It would be prudent to acknowledge, however, that there can be resource or practical constraints which can limit the amount of review work that may be carried out in any one year.  In addition, the desirability of ex-ante review can be overtaken by timing limitations in the context of the budget and finance Bill annual cycle.<\/p><p> Four tax expenditures reports have been published as part of the annual budget process in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.  The publication of these annual reports allows us to meet our obligations under Article 14(2) of EU Council Directive 2011\/85\/EU on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the member states, which states: \"Member States shall publish detailed information on the impact of tax expenditures on revenues.\"  Each report has followed the consistent pattern of outlining the fiscal impact of a range of tax expenditures and publishing the results of certain tax expenditure reviews that have been completed since the previous budget.  In the 2018 report, we included reviews of the employment and investment incentive, EII, agri-tax and help-to-buy, as well as film relief and start-up relief for businesses.  All five were comprehensive reviews.<\/p><p> On the question of periodic re-authorisation, it should be noted that all tax expenditures that commenced post-2014 have been subject to sunset clauses.<\/p><p> Finally, on key message 1, defining the benchmark system, the Department acknowledges the desirability of defining such a system.  Both the Department and Revenue recognise that they publish different classifications of tax expenditure measures.<\/p><p>This is not due, however, to differences of opinion arising out of a formal deliberative process.  Instead, the approach taken by Revenue is to publish all available information on tax expenditures - broadly defined - and this should be viewed alongside a newer and more formal classification approach adopted by the Department.  Development of an agreed approach to classification of tax expenditures is a task that could be built into the work programmes of both organisations in the medium term.<br\/><br\/>In the international literature, the challenges associated with identifying a benchmark system are acknowledged.  While there is significant diversity in working definitions of tax expenditures across countries, a common element is the concept of a departure from a tax system benchmark.  The 2010 OECD report profiled and compared the tax expenditure policies of ten OECD countries and concluded: &ldquo;Some countries have very elaborately specified benchmarks, while others have only implicit definitions of tax expenditures from which their benchmark systems are inferred.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Overall, in the past ten years, significant progress has been made in raising the profile of the issue and the cost of tax expenditures.  As noted in the 2017 tax strategy group paper, significant advances have been made in the analysis of tax expenditures and the development of an analytical process for such evaluation, whether they are <i>ex ante <\/i>or <i>ex post <\/i>evaluations, which has built on the work of the 2009 Commission on Taxation.  There is a comprehensive evaluation structure in place for such reviews, namely, the Department&rsquo;s 2014 tax expenditure guideline, and the Department seeks to carry out reviews of existing tax expenditures and <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluations of proposed new tax incentives.  I have already mentioned, as examples, the comprehensive reviews of EII and agri-tax carried out last year.  Furthermore, two time-limited incentives, namely, the home renovation incentive and the start your own business incentive were reviewed and discontinued last year, both having achieved their original policy objectives.<br\/><br\/>This is not to say that there is not further work to be done.  I hope this presentation will lead towards a conclusion that there is no issue of principle holding back progress.  The direction of travel is clear.  The only issue is one of prioritisation of the work alongside other important tasks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cullen for his statement.

Will Mr. Cullen comment on that and, for example, whether there are different sunset clauses for different expenditures and, if so, why?  This is a learning exercise.  Sunset clauses did not apply before 2014.  Are those tax expenditures under review?  I doubt Mr. Cullen will have to hand a list of all tax expenditures still in existence that are not subject to a sunset clause, but he might revert to the committee.<\/p> <p>  In summary, will the Department provide a list of tax expenditures that are subject to sunset clauses, as of 2014; a list of tax expenditures from before 2014 that are not subject to sunset clauses, because I presume there cannot be any from after 2014 that are not subject to sunset clauses; and a briefing note about the lists?

However, we have come a long way in the past ten years from a position where, prior to the work of the Commission on Taxation, nobody would have had a decent handle on the extent of tax expenditures, the various areas where tax expenditures occurred and whether some of those could be considered part of the basic tax system or whether they are more discretionary.  In short, there is further work to be done in terms of where we stand internationally.  There may well be data readily available in other OECD or EU countries.  We can have a look at those data and there would be no problem providing them to the committee alongside the other information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Cullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I have a final question.

I would like to get some sense of the <i>quid pro quo <\/i>involved.  The relief is intended to be a boon to the film industry and if that is the case, that in turn generates other tax income, for example, VAT, income tax and corporation tax.  Has any work been done on the benefits of particular tax reliefs?  In other words, are these reliefs paying for themselves?  On the one hand, the State is foregoing income by giving a relief, while on the other hand there are 1,000 or 1 million people employed who are paying a certain amount of tax, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#O00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>In general, in terms of tax reliefs, the periodic reviews we do examine whether a tax relief is still justified, the purpose of it and so on.

That would follow on from the kind of guidelines we have set down in our tax expenditure guidelines.  The bigger reliefs might have more of a focus and might be reviewed at more regular intervals than some of the smaller ones.  The sunset clause period would take a lead from that.

The Deputy rightly posed significant questions about the film relief and put the caveat that while the section 481 relief should be extended for certainty in the industry, it needs to be monitored and scrutinised.  It should be monitored and scrutinised closely.  He alluded to the need for that to happen.<\/p> <p>  Mention was rightly made about training.  Beyond having a specific minimum number of trainees per production, the relationship between this significant expenditure and the training, accreditation and qualification of trainees is unclear.  I put it to Ms Donaghy, and she might give an opinion, that there is no connection at all because there is no accreditation process or qualification process.<\/p><p>There is no tracking of trainees with the result that we do not know whether they progress from one production to another.  Perhaps Ms Donaghy can comment on employment in the same regard.  Section 481 requires the provision in exchange for this very significant tax relief of quality employment and training but we, again, have no real tracking of the former.  A great deal of dispute arises on estimates of how many jobs the relief is responsible for with figures proposed from 17,000 to practically zero.  It is a pretty big spectrum of opinion.  There is a significant difference between 17,000 jobs and almost none and we need to get to the bottom of that.  It is an actual condition of the relief, after all.  Can Ms Donaghy confirm the analysis in the report that the Department has made it somewhat a condition of continuing the relief that these things will be looked at?  If so, I agree completely.  Does she accept that we do not really have a handle on the extent to which it is contributing to meaningful training connected to career pathways and tracking employment?  Even the people who receive the relief have been on television to say nobody expects job security in the film industry.  They say things like \"You are only as good as your last job.\"  That might be fine for them as they are in receipt of the relief, but for those who work for them and who do not have a job when the production is over or any idea of whether they will be employed on the next one, it is not so good.  It does not add up to fulfilling the criterion of quality employment when even the people who are getting the relief describe the employment they give as totally precarious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#P02600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Can we allow for an answer to all of that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#Q00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Yes, but I ask how we are monitoring that stuff and who is monitoring it exactly.

Arguably, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a role too.  I will finish my question on film on the following point.  I asked the Minister directly whether the quality employment and training condition require at a minimum the application of employment law and he said \"Yes.\"  However, there are allegations that employment law is not being applied and, in fact, there are WRC rulings against some of the production companies which are getting money where they have been found to have breached the rights of their employees.  Nevertheless, they are still getting the relief.  How do we police that?  Is it right that they should continue to get the money when they have been shown by the WRC to have actually breached the rights of some of their workers?

Starting from the most recent, the Deputy raised the issues on all Stages as the Finance Act was going through.  The Minister is very conscious that these issues have been raised and he has asked us, as we continue to look at the relief this year, working with Revenue on the regulations and guidance notes that accompany it, to take a look at these issues and see what we can do with that.  It has to be accepted that the Department of Finance cannot do the only running on this.  When it comes to things like training, the Department cannot set out what the training standards are for the film industry.  Having said that, we are more than happy to work with representatives of the industry and, to the extent that there can be any common guidelines with the industry, to build those into the criteria of the relief.  The relief is administered primarily by Revenue and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  One of the things we did in the Finance Act this year was to split the certification process to require that producer companies come in before main production commences to apply for the culture certificate as part of the application for the relief.<\/p><p>That will allow the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to interact with the producer companies on the training requirements attached to the relief.  It ensures the potential exists for early intervention.  The other thing happening is the regional uplift introduced this year that is subject to state-aid approval before it commences.  That is very specifically tied to qualifying for the relief around training requirements and it applies only to productions in the regions where it can be shown that there are insufficient numbers of skilled crew members available within a certain vicinity of the location in which the production is taking place.  The first requirement is to show the shortage of local skills, the second is to show that costs will be incurred in bringing in people from distant areas and the third is to show that local staff have been trained.  We are working on the criteria at the moment and will be specific about what the training of local staff will have to entail.  The purpose of the uplift, which is there for a short period, is to develop pools of talent outside the existing hubs.  That is tied very specifically to training.<\/p><p> I was asked about the numbers employed and that will have come out of the review.  The cost-benefit analysis estimates, based on 2016, that there were 2,158 employees directly engaged on productions supported by section 481.  The analysis estimates that a further 902 indirect employments are related to those to give a total of 3,060 full-time equivalents associated with section 481 film-relief projects in 2016.  That is based on the criteria set out in the cost-benefit analysis so members can see exactly what was taken into account in arriving at those figures.  I am aware of larger figures, one from a report done by Olsberg of the audiovisual sector as a whole, which is a wider sector, including radio, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>And RT&Eacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#R00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>That came to 14,370 but it is a different metric taking in a much wider cohort.

My question is general.  The purpose of this meeting is scrutiny of tax expenditures.  I am interested in having a layman's outline of the process.  For example, if we take the help-to-buy incentive scheme, which is clearly a tax expenditure, what is the process from when the plan is hatched through to the development and germination of the idea and the scheme?  Who decides what the costings are?  It is clear that the witnesses know their business.  What happens after the germination of a scheme such as the help-to-buy scheme?  What should happen?  In which way is the scheme not operating in the way it should?  It strikes me that lay people watching proceedings would say if they were budgeting in their households the same way as in this particular tax expenditure, it would be clear that somebody would have to pick up the tab at the end of the day.  If we take the help-to-buy scheme, it was estimated it would be &euro;50 million in one year and now we are talking about it being more than &euro;180 million when it closes.  Will the witnesses take me through the process from the time somebody comes up with a hare-brained idea to where it is costed and we end up with so many mistakes?  What should happen to make sure the mistakes of over-expenditure do not happen in any scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#S00700","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I will take the Deputy through the broad outline of the steps that ought to apply.  In the first instance, a market defect or need would need to be identified.  In the case of the scheme the Deputy mentioned, at the time it was proposed, there was a perceived lack of activity in the building sector.  The scheme was put in place to seek to promote activity in the sector by providing tax relief to first-time buyers.  Is there a need?  What is the need?  Can that need be met through other routes?  I mentioned the direct expenditure route in my opening statement.  From an official perspective, it has advantages in that it is more transparent and it can be more focused.  Our first question is always: can this be done through direct spending?  The budgetary process around spending is much more developed than on the tax expenditure side.<\/p><p>That is also true internationally.  <br\/><br\/>Moving on from there, if a need is identified, the question is to devise a scheme that addresses the need in a way that has regard to the scarcity of public funds.  While there may not be the type of transparency one would like with regard to tax spending, from the point of view of the internal budgetary process, we are obliged to seek to put a number on the cost of a scheme when it is being introduced.  That number finds its way into the budgetary arithmetic and calculations on whether the budget will be balanced in the fiscal space and all that stuff.  We always seek to put a number on it, accepting that in some cases it may be very difficult.  <br\/><br\/>I mentioned the KEEP scheme in my opening statement.  It was a brand new scheme and it was difficult to identify what the cost would be.  In that case, we looked at the cost in the nearest jurisdiction, the UK, which has a similar scheme and scaled it down to arrive at an estimate.  It is far from perfect but that is the process.  In terms of policy development, we seek to put the parameters of the scheme in place and a number of broad policy controls.  The Minister of the day would need to approve the scheme.  From there it might be announced as part of a budget or if it is a little later than the budget, as part of the finance Bill.  Our Revenue colleagues would then draft the legislation in accordance with the broad policy parameters.  From there the scheme would find its way, in the Finance Bill, to the Houses of the Oireachtas where it would be debated and modified if necessary and, ultimately, approved as legislation.  <br\/><br\/>A newer feature in recent years is we seek to time limit schemes.  The help-to-buy scheme has a time limit on it.  It is due to expire at the end of this year.  Ideally, as part of the identification of the need for the measure, we might undertake an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation.  While desirable, it may not always be possible.  In the case of the help-to-buy scheme, two subsequent reviews were carried out shortly after the incentive was put in place.  Once the scheme goes into operation, it is closely monitored.  In the case of the KEEP scheme, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, we keep our eyes and ears open.  Although no formal data are available yet on the operation of the scheme and the number of claimants, the anecdotal evidence, including that coming through representations, is that the uptake has been lower than anticipated.  We are fairly responsive to that.  Ideally, if we put a scheme in place, we want it to work efficiently and effectively.  If that is not the case, we seek to take steps to make it happen.  With KEEP, this year, once we get some formal data from our colleagues in Revenue, we will, with the Minister's approval, undertake a consultation process with stakeholders to find out why it is not working as it should.  We made some modifications in the Finance Act 2018 to increase the level of relief available and make the scheme more attractive but we intend to take further steps this year following a consultation process.  They are the broad steps we take with any relief.<\/p><p>Once a scheme has met its policy purpose, we would recommend to the Minister that it be potentially wound up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Cullen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I want to come in on that matter.

As my colleague mentioned, when a new scheme is being introduced, it is difficult to estimate the uptake in the absence of data.  For the help-to-buy scheme, Revenue would have looked at our stamp duty data in order to get an idea of how many properties have been built in recent years and the value of same and then tried to make some estimates of how many of those properties within the criteria proposed within the help-to-buy scheme might have qualified and used that past behaviour as a measure to project forward.  Even in the absence of detailed forecasts, we can still look at some past behaviour and try to get indicators.  The other side of that is that we publish detailed statistics on the help-to-buy scheme on a monthly basis, breaking down the number of applications and claims and the cost of same by value and county.

Income tax is the easiest context in which to give an example; in order to cost any measure that is proposed for any given year, Revenue does a lot of work to construct a base for it and in general that is based on tax returns, which is the best data that can be had because it is population data for the country.  Tax returns are filed after the fact, however, so they are always a year or so behind.  For example, for 2019 there will be a 2016 base.  That means that data from 2016 will be used to give comparative full population data for 2019 and that data is then grown up to reflect the 2019 tax base by applying macros to account for increases in employment and income and then that is used to try to estimate the cost of measures.  The difficulty with that is that a lot of assumptions are being used and that is the only way it can be done because I cannot tell the committee today exactly what will happen tomorrow; I can only estimate it and it takes an awful lot of work to do those estimates.  The question is whether that is the best use of time or whether we would be better served doing something like a cost benefit analysis where we can look at what has actually happened, albeit that is what actually happened last year, and then use that to make the policy decisions going forward.

Essentially, this comes back to the timing of tax returns and tax payments.  Again taking 2017 as an example, businesses registered for income tax would usually pay their tax during 2017 on a preliminary basis for that year but they do not actually file their returns for 2017 until nine or ten months after the year ends.  Therefore, the income tax returns for 2017 were being filed in the final quarter of 2018 of last year.  We then have to process those data.  There can be late returns, people who do not file on time for various reasons and paper filers still, so we must go through quite a process to get those data together.  It will therefore probably be the second quarter of this year when we have the data ready and can do the analysis for 2017.  Ultimately, however, it comes back to when the tax returns are filed.  It is the tax returns that have all the detailed information.  Sometimes we will get payments in on a real-time basis during the year but it is only when we get the tax returns in that we are given the details of the incomes, the profits of the business or the individuals and the various reliefs and exemptions they have used and we understand their full positions.

To go through them, based on what is here, they include things like capital allowances, trading losses carried forward, group relief and double tax relief for tax paid in other jurisdictions.  Then one gets down to what are considered to be tax expenditures.  There is the research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit and the film credit.

One example, and it is one of the larger ones, is capital allowances.<\/p><p>I will explain the reason they are considered part of the benchmark system as opposed to a tax expenditure.  If a farmer buys a tractor, that is for his business.  The purchase of a software licence by a small retailer to run his or her stock control is a business expense if it is part of the business.  It is not a tax relief; it is merely an expense of doing business.  Scaling that up, if one has a massive factory, the fit-out of the plant and machinery, likewise, qualifies for allowances, or if one has a licence for intellectual property, that comes under capital allowances.  They are not regarded as a tax expenditure under that definition because they are considered to be a cost of business and part of the benchmark system.  The fact that they are not classified as a tax expenditure does not mean we ignore them.  We are very much conscious that they are there.  It does not mean they get any less attention.  We just do not call them a tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2019012200002#Z01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Donaghy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>There is a disjunction between the way Ms Donaghy's description and the Revenue document, to which I referred, which lists all these various reliefs, expenditures and credits.

I should have said initially that I commend the witnesses on doing all this work.  There is significant detail in the analysis they did of the reliefs.

The owners of that business get a tax benefit that ordinary workers do not get and one could argue that the worker should get that tax relief.  There is much to be debated.

I will touch on some of the key areas that may be of interest to the committee in 2018.  In 2018, IFI engaged in more than 170,000 patrol hours.  These were divided over 30,499 individual controls protecting the inland fisheries resource.  In 2018, we seized 808 items, including fishing rods, fish, nets and various types of illegal fishing engines.  An average of 14.4 km of illegal nets were seized in recent years.  In 2018, we seized 11.5 km of illegal nets.<\/p><p>While this represents a reduction on previous years and is likely related to the reduction in the abundance of our salmon stocks, it is nonetheless a considerable volume of illegal net and is capable of doing significant damage to our fish stocks.  IFI initiated over 83 prosecutions for fisheries and environmental offences in 2018, and 82 such prosecutions in 2017.<\/p><p> A significant amount of the work of IFI involves regulatory compliance.  In this regard, we interacted with 33,000 angler inspections last year.  The anglers in question were checked for compliance with licences, permits and bylaws.  An average of 645 checks were carried out on fish dealers.  Almost 24,000 environmental inspections were carried out on industrial, agricultural and wastewater treatment plants and civil engineering works.  Forty-four fish kills were reported last year.  Given the extreme climatic conditions experienced during the summer drought period, the number of fish kills was relatively low.  This is a credit to our staff, working in tandem with other relevant agencies, and to the responsible actions of the farming community and others involved in water infrastructure.<\/p><p> IFI has invested more than &euro;3 million in renewing its RIB fleet.  Twelve specialised RIBs are being delivered to IFI on a staged basis.  At this point, we have received eight of those boats.  They are built to the highest standards of safety.  Each boat carries an inflatable life raft and has a P6 license attached to it.  On foot of this investment, IFI will be able to operate single RIB patrols, as opposed to the twin RIB patrols we have had to operate up to now.  This represents a significant operational efficiency for the organisation.  It also represents a carbon reduction.<\/p><p> The national strategy for angling development, NSAD, was launched in February 2016 following an extensive research and public consultation process.  It is the first comprehensive national framework for the development of Ireland's angling resource.<\/p><p> In 2017, IFI developed an online grant application portal to improve systems and processes used in managing funding schemes and ensure public funds are managed in line with governance requirements.  We also introduced an environmental assessment process to ensure environmental governance is achieved.  During 2017, IFI helped angling clubs to deliver on the 50 locally-led projects that had been awarded under the 2016 capital grants scheme.  In late 2017, we launched a number of additional funding schemes for implementation in 2018 and thereafter.  Some &euro;2.9 million was awarded to 174 projects across the country between 2016 to 2018.  Approximately 60% of all schemes have been delivered at this point.<\/p><p> Angling access has been improved at 78 locations, with an additional 22 locations due for completion in 2019.  Thirty-five habitat enhancement projects, which we expect to complete over this year and next year, were included in the 2017 and 2018 schemes.<\/p><p> In recognition of the difficulties faced by voluntary stakeholders in achieving governance standards, IFI has established a programme management office and appointed an overall programme director and five animators.  Their role is to work directly with stakeholders to improve project development and delivery.  The benefits of this approach were felt during 2018.<\/p><p> IFI's research division conducts a wide range of applied research programmes to facilitate the provision of data and knowledge concerning the habitats and species under its protection.  This is used to support a range of Departments, including our parent Department, in policy development, in support of decision making and in informing stakeholders and other agencies.  The focus on applied research resulted in the publication of 27 international peer-reviewed publications in 2017.<\/p><p> IFI's national research programmes are reinforced by co-operation and partnerships with national and international research and funding organisations.  We have had a degree of success in this regard.  I refer, for example, to the COMPASS project, where we have achieved &euro;500,000 in INTERREG funding, and to the Catchment CARE project, where we have achieved &euro;2.37 million in INTERREG funding.  These achievements were particular highlights in 2018.<\/p><p> IFI remains seriously concerned about salmon abundance levels.  If one looks at the pre-fishery abundance levels - the estimated number of fish returning to the coast of Ireland before any exploitation takes place - one will see it is currently estimated that between 240,000 and 300,000 wild salmon are returning to the Irish coast, as against highs of almost 2 million fish in the 1970s.  If action had not been taken by the Government in 2006, it is likely that the decline may well have been more pronounced.  Concern about salmon abundance nationally and internationally led to 2019 being declared the International Year of the Salmon.  This is a joint worldwide initiative of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization and the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission.  It seeks to raise awareness of what humans can do to ensure salmon and their habitats are conserved.<\/p><p>Inland Fisheries Ireland will take a full and active part in the international year of the salmon to raise awareness of the state of Irish salmon stocks.<\/p><p> IFI successfully implemented two major transformational projects in the business in 2018.  It transformed its fleet management and utilisation.  All existing systems and processes were overhauled and electronic logbooks, standardised maintenance programmes for all vehicles, additional training for all staff and a vehicle telemetry system were implemented.  This has resulted in significant savings on fuel, amounting to more than 30,000 l in 2018, and increases in organisational efficiency.  On foot of these changes, IFI was awarded the Fleet Transport Association's VanSafe accreditation and our logistics manager was awarded a Road Safety Authority Leading Light award.  In early 2019, IFI will complete this programme by replenishing the fleet with fewer, smaller and more fit-for-purpose vehicles, including a number of electric vehicles.  In addition to further fuel savings, this element of the programme will generate a significant CO2 reduction and put IFI well on track for achieving its current carbon reduction targets.<\/p><p> IFI also implemented an organisation-wide time management system in which all staff are now recording daily time, absences and leave in a consistent manner via an online system.  This system has improved IFI&rsquo;s operational efficiency and allowed the development of appropriate management reports which will ensure that the organisation can easily demonstrate compliance with relevant legislation.  It is planned to extend this system in 2019 and incorporate additional functionality, such as online subsistence and metric collation modules.<\/p><p> I will highlight an issue that could have positive impacts on IFI if resolved.  The principal Act governing the sector is the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959.  This Act, a consolidation of fisheries legislation from around the late 19th century to 1959, is 60 years old.  While it has served inland fisheries well over the years, it is no longer fit for purpose and is holding back the modernisation of the service.  My parent Department has done significant work on preparing a new fisheries Bill.  While recognising that legislation falls entirely within the remit of the Oireachtas, I stress that from an agency perspective, the sooner we have more modern fisheries legislation the better.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention and again stress that this is only a snapshot of some of the work completed by IFI.  I would be happy to take any questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019012200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I represent the constituency of Galway West.  As Dr. Byrne will know, the western lakes are highly regarded and considered some of the most unique natural assets in Ireland and Europe insofar as salmonoid rivers and lakes are concerned.  There have been a number of public meetings with anglers across the constituency.  They come not just from the west but from all over Ireland.  Their concerns relate to the upkeep and protection of our rivers and lakes and our brown trout and salmon, all of which are great national assets.  Anglers believe the national strategy for angling development, NSAD, model is not working.  They have informed public representatives that stocks are deteriorating.  Under the previous model, which worked well, local fishermen with local knowledge worked on the ground to ensured the habitat and stocks were protected.  Given that the anglers in attendance at the public meetings were from all parts of the country, one has a sense that they cannot all be wrong about the NSAD and how it is working.  What engagement does the IFI have with the anglers on the ground who believe they are now at a distance?

Engagement with anglers and their sense of ownership are at the heart of this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019012200002#N00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Chairman has raised a few points which I will try to tease out.  Regarding straightforward capital investment, we received two tranches of funding from the NSAD, &euro;500,000 in 2016 and &euro;1.5 million in 2017.  Both of these allocations were for capital.  As the Chairman will appreciate, we can only spend them on capital works.  We have tried to the best of our ability to incorporate as much operational money as we can under the heading of capital works.  However, they are explicitly capital works.  That is a source of frustration because there are certain things we can do with capital money that we cannot do under the rubric of operational maintenance.<\/p> <p>  There is no question that the situation has changed.<\/p><p>IFI was established in 2010, following the amalgamation of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  In one sense, the ownership model has changed, because people had a close linkage to the Western Regional Fisheries Board and were only a telephone call away from a board member, which kept that sense of people being accessible on the ground.  On the governance side, the fisheries service went from 164 board members to ten and from regional boards to the unitary IFI.<\/p><p> There were also changes in staffing.  Like every State agency, we experienced commensurate reductions in the difficult period of the recession.  Our agency went from a head count of approximately 440 whole-time equivalents to 269 at the lowest point.  We also supplemented the 440 staff with up to 60 temporary seasonal staff.  In the peak of summer as many as 500 people were working on the ground.  Resources were certainly cut back.  As an agency, we are forced to look at how we deliver the service.  The question for us is whether we can be the people on the ground all the time.  We cannot do that with the resources we have.<\/p><p> One of the big developments was a lot of negativity towards the NSAD.  I am aware of this.  Obviously it became very political and public.  We established the programme management office.  Our programme manager comes from a western constituency and he is very much aware of the needs and the individual stakeholders.  A chap called Mr. Liam Gavin, who is one of our assistant inspectors, manages that office.  He is very much clued in on the situation on the ground in the west.  I have tried to engage the programme manager's office with the project owners and the applicants on a regular basis.  <\/p><p> There is another element, which does not just apply to IFI but is common to all State agencies.  Governance requirements have increased significantly over the years.  In our area we have financial governance requirements, as does every agency, concerning how we distribute taxpayers' money, grant money and whatnot.  We also have a separate box, which is environmental governance requirements.  There has been a much greater focus on them.  I will be honest with the Deputy.  The level of governance required is significant, and many clubs that might have been able to tip away and do a few bits and pieces find it is beyond their grasp.  That is why we have invested so heavily in the programme management office to try to bring those clubs up to standards.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019012200002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>That issue has come up with anglers.

They see a deterioration in the level of stocks and the habitats.  The key point is that the local knowledge of people who knew the waterways and lakes and were maintaining them is being lost.  Any organisation can be hit and miss where standards are concerned, but anglers are seeing a deterioration and they do not believe the NSAD is working as well as it could.  I appreciate the constraints Dr. Byrne has referred to but they see a lot going into capital investment.

Their report is comprehensive so I will not comment on each item.  I met them in Roscommon and I thank them and their staff for the excellent work being carried out in my vicinity in the lake just beside our farm.  The fishing stands are of excellent quality with beautiful presentation.  They are certainly very attractive.<\/p> <p>  I will bring up the old issue of which I am now just a bit tired.  I refer to the gross unfairness of charging for a permit to fish in a number of rivers and lakes, particularly in Roscommon, Longford and east Galway, including the River Suck, which is in the village of Castlecoote, where I live; its tributary, the Derryhippo river; Lough Linbaun; and Black's Lake.  They require a permit and the charge is quite a disadvantage.  It is &euro;45 per year for an adult and &euro;20 for a child.  One day costs &euro;20 for an adult.  No permit is required in any other part of Ireland.<\/p><p>That the chief executive of IFI can stand over such discrimination against our area is outrageous.  I am sick of listening to people such as the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, trying to explain this away over a long period.  It is clear discrimination.<\/p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland is attracting people to the area under the Hidden Heartlands scheme.  When a fisherman or fisherwoman asks if there are any fees or permits in the area, he or she is told there are and that they are being administered by bailiffs.  They can drive less than 20 miles to the River Suck and fish there without any charge being imposed.  That is wrong.  It is affecting our area and destroying fishing tourism there.  IFI can build all the fishing stands it likes, but very few people will use them as long as this situation continues.  In Newport, juvenile anglers were given equipment to encourage them to fish.  I do not know how long the agency will continue to stand over this.  It is totally discriminatory.  How many summonses have been issued by bailiffs to people fishing without permits in this area?  Dr. Byrne will come back with the usual excuse about the ESB, its licences, etc., but the latter is a State body, as is IFI, and this matter is being kicked to touch all the time.  I have heard Ministers do this regularly.  I can only go so far.  However, I ask the Chairman that we put it to Dr. Byrne and his colleague, the business development manager, that it is difficult to see how one can develop a business in an area where there are beautiful coarse fisheries to which people are not coming because they are afraid and do not want to pay extra charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019012200002#O00300","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Leyden for his kind comments and his hospitality when we were in Castlecoote, which we very much appreciate.  The project to which he refers is both worthwhile and excellent.  He is correct that we have discussed this matter quite a few times.  It would be beneficial to note as the other members may not be aware that there is a permit scheme in the upper Shannon area.  Every year, the Central Fisheries Board, followed by IFI and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, manage that on behalf of the ESB.  These are State-owned waters for which the ESB is responsible.  The permit is to allay in some way the cost of managing the upper Shannon.  The permit generated for IFI in the region of &euro;120,000 per annum over the last five years.  The average between 2013 and 2017 was &euro;118,000 so rounding it up gives &euro;120,000.  We provide approximately &euro;50,000 per year to the midlands fisheries fund.  In the Roscommon area, the upper Shannon generated a permit revenue of approximately &euro;51,000 over that period yet we put back almost &euro;56,000 in the midlands fisheries fund.  The latter, which constitutes more or less half or perhaps 40% of the permit fee, we give out to clubs and groups to do the works like those the Senator referred to at Stoneham's Lake.  Over that period, we disbursed approximately &euro;240,000 and of that funding, 24% went to the Roscommon area.  I take the Deputy's point that his area is slightly different to that of the people down the road but we are managing the upper Shannon on behalf of the ESB.  It costs in the region of &euro;700,000 to manage the upper Shannon and we are generating &euro;120,000 back for it.  I accept that anglers say that the &euro;45 fee is considerable but one should look at it in the context of other recreational activities.  That sum would just about pay for one round of golf on a Saturday in July.  That is the level of fee we are talking about.  It goes back to some extent to the issue to which the Chairman, namely, the upkeep of the resource.  We are working in a resource-limited environment.  The Senator's is the only area in this context which pays a permit and our view is that we should probably have a slightly different pitch, namely, that everyone should pay for permits or make some contribution to the upkeep of the resource.

Ms Campion mentioned access, car parks, etc., but is the board of IFI carrying out a review of the impact of the NSAD and how it is helping - or not - the habitat in terms of enhancing streams and waterways?  How is IFI assessing that?  Anglers are telling us, as elected representatives, that it is deteriorating.  It is fine to pick a strategy but it needs to be monitored and assessed to see if it is working.  Anglers have indicated that it is not working.  They managed it better when it was done at local level and they are saying that there has not been any engagement with them.  We need a clearer answer from Ms Campion on how IFI will work with anglers because there is a real disconnect between them and IFI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019012200002#S00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1548172800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>There is a real willingness within IFI to work with anglers.  We have five officers who work and engage with them fully.  We track all the hours spent trying to engage with anglers.

We have reviewed the success of the projects in terms of the officers going out to do that.<\/p> <p>  The issue for many of the clubs is that previously they would give money to IFI and then we would do the work for them.  They thought they were doing fantastic work themselves because they were handing over the money, and it was really useful.  IFI previously had more staff and could deploy them to do the work.  We no longer have the staff.  By the same token, we can no longer just jump into a river and do work because we get a lot of criticism in terms of security.  We have to get the environmental governance right.  There are screenings, assessments and so on that have to be carried out in order to facilitate in-stream projects and while we want to be doing many of them, they take a long time.  We have tried to empower stakeholders to do that for themselves and many of them are a little taken aback by that in terms of asking, \"What will we do?\".  In order to do that, we have put a panel of experts in place that anglers can access.  We will fund them to access those experts and guide them on what they need and how they can tender for them.  We are almost bending over backwards for them but they are up against the barrier of governance and the tradition that used to exist when we had many staff on the ground and could jump in and do the work.  I refer to the habitats directive, Natura 2000.  We cannot go into a river and cause flooding or biodiversity degradation.  We understand that.  We have held workshops in many areas.  We have developed an environmental assessment process.  Everything is available online.  We have made videos to explain the position.  We have our project officers providing training to our staff and stakeholders.

We have met the planning authority and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and we have told them that they need to have a pre-planning meeting with the planning authority and there may be no planning permission needed.  We cannot give the anglers public money to deliver a project in somebody else's river.  They will not do that because they are afraid that access to the river will be taken away completely.  One can understand that a farmer might become anxious that his ownership will be called into question when somebody else is apply for planning permission to do works in a river.

Perhaps we could come back and have some members of the board accompany us.<\/p> <p>  In terms of governance, we have taken an internal audit of the NSAD.  We have also done an internal review of the NSAD to see whether the strategy works and whether we need to do anything differently.  One of the fundamental issues that we are facing is that the funding we received for the NSAD is capital funding.  No matter what way one dresses that up, this money has to be spent on capital works because if we did not spend it on capital works, I would have to come before the committee to answer a different question.<\/p> <p>  The works on habitat enhancement to which the Chairman referred are operationally funded works.  The old fisheries was a manpower based organisation.  IFI has a significant funding deficit.  The entirety of our own resources and income will pay the deficit in non-pay funding.  We now have a &euro;2.6 million annual funding deficit in our pay resources.  We do not have enough money to keep current staff and we are effectively trying to borrow the family silver to do that work.  That has direct current impacts on the kind of work we can do on the ground in terms of operational funding.  We would absolutely love it if a tranche of money came to IFI through the NSAD to do operational works.  That would mean a scheme could open along the lines that Ms Campion has identified and would allow habitat work to be done.<\/p> <p>  As I am sure members are well aware, things have changed.  Sometimes in our frequent discussions with stakeholders one is brought back to another time because we all think the times were great back then.  We all think things were great in the past.  To take the example of Lough Corrib in the past number of years, we lost char from the lake in 1995, there is extensive development around its banks, roach have been introduced, lagarosiphon has been recorded and there is eutrophication of the lake.  Lough Corrib as we know it from our memories was what we term a cold, clear oligotrophic lake, which was pretty much entirely composed of salmonidae.  It had salmon, trout and eels, and back in the 1950s it had perch and pike and that was pretty much it.  Now there is a fairly decent supply of coarse fish and because the climatic and environmental conditions have changed in the lake there are significant populations of roach in that lake.  It is changing the dynamic of the lake.  These are things that we probably cannot stop.  This is linked into the question on climate change and warming.<\/p><p>One of the subsystems of Lough Corrib is the Owenriff system, which some of the Chairman's constituents have also mentioned.  For considerable periods last summer, we were recording temperatures in the mid-20s in the Owenriff system.  Salmon and trout are cold-water species.  We also have cool-water and warm-water species.  Temperatures in the mid-20s are pretty much lethal to cold-water species.  That is an example of the changes we are seeing on the lake.  Inland Fisheries Ireland, of its own volition, took a leadership role in respect of lagarosiphon.  The western and central boards said that the presence of lagarosiphon was an issue.  The Chairman has probably seen the before and after pictures of Rinneroon Bay.  We managed that programme on a shoestring.  We kept at it.  We borrowed and begged for money to keep the show going.  Even though we still do not have statutory powers, we are still doing this because we think it is important.  We are contributing to the development of the lake.  We are not doing so in the way that many of the stakeholders want because we are not operating in the same environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019012200002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ciaran Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1548172800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I think we have asked all of our questions for today.
