I welcome Deputy O'Reilly, who will brief members.  This will be followed by questions and answers from members, which must conclude no later than 4 p.m.  Before I invite the Deputy to speak, I want to inform her that the committee is finalising the list of stakeholders it will engage with on the Bill and the Deputy will be advised of the final list.

The Deputy is protected by absolute privilege in respect of her presentation to the committee.  This means she has an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything she says at the meeting.  However, she is expected not to abuse the privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the Deputy&rsquo;s statements are potentially defamatory towards any identifiable person or entity she will be directed to discontinue her remarks and it is imperative that she complies with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  We have allocated five minutes of speaking time.

I also want to say a special word of thanks to Sin&eacute;ad N&iacute; Bhroin for all the work she has put into this legislation.  Gender-based abuse and violence is not just a justice issue or a health issue; it is a housing issue, a children&rsquo;s issue, a worker&rsquo;s issue and a worker&rsquo;s rights issue.  When a person is subjected to domestic violence, abuse or coercive control he or she is robbed of his or her dignity, confidence and sense of safety.  This trauma seeps into every aspect of their lives, and that includes the victims&rsquo; working lives.  Those who suffer domestic abuse are our colleagues and often our friends.  Some carry the physical and emotional impact of the violence with them into the workplace.  They do so because they fear losing out on badly needed pay or do not want to run the risk of disruption to their careers.  Many cannot face going to work, some because of physical injuries - the all-too-visible bruises, black eyes and cuts - and others because of the deep mental scarring.  As a result, they lose income and fear that questions will be raised about their reliability.  Others are painfully aware of and understandably sensitive to the stigma that comes with being abused and victimised, especially when it happens at home, in the place they should feel the safest.  The importance of this legislation was summed up for me in a comment a woman made to me in a social media message.  I will not give her name but she told me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI hope this gets done.  When I went to the refuge I used holidays and tried to make up the time but I could not make up all the time.  It was so much pressure. <\/blockquote> <p>Employers also lose out from the absence of employment protections for victims of domestic abuse.  Absenteeism, lost productivity, administrative costs, and job churn have a real impact on organisations.  There is an accepted lack of workplace awareness of domestic violence.  Marrying enactment of this legislation with a national workplace awareness of a domestic violence campaign can and will make a tangible difference for victims and their employers.  The perpetrator of the violence should not be allowed to take any more from the victim, nor should it be that a victim&rsquo;s only option is to take annual or unpaid leave.  The last thing a victim of domestic violence needs is the stress of a phone call from his or her boss, a light pay cheque or even the prospect of losing his or her job.  They also need privacy and confidentiality.  Being pressured or coerced back into the workplace before they are ready only adds to the distress.<\/p><p>The Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2020 seeks to offer victims of domestic violence up to ten days' paid leave annually.  It is a comprehensive and thorough Bill, prepared in consultation with the domestic violence sector and providing protections for employers in line with those contained in the paternity leave legislation and it was drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Affairs.  If we are to end the epidemic of domestic abuse in this State, we need a whole-of-society response that both supports and protects victims.  This legislation is an important strand of this.  The legislation provides that workers do not have to prove their abuse or give an employer documentary evidence for the leave needed as to do so will act as a barrier to victims seeking the support they need.  This is an important provision.<\/p><p>There is also an economic cost to domestic violence and the sums involved are eye-watering.  Research published by Safe Ireland and National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, last year estimated that the national cost is &euro;56 billion over a 20-year period.  That is close to the entire tax take of the State in 2018.  The research also highlights the complex relationship between poverty, social exclusion and domestic violence.  Employment should be an avenue out of abuse.  New Zealand, Australia and provinces in Canada have already introduced forms of paid leave.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and others have called on the Government to ratify the International Labour Organization, ILO, Convention No. 190 on violence and harassment in the world of work.  Article 18 of the accompanying recommendation identifies the provision of paid leave for the victims of domestic violence, flexible work arrangements and awareness-raising about the effects of domestic violence as appropriate measures to mitigate the impacts of it in the workplace.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirmed last month that the Government is committed to working towards being among the first ILO member states to ratify Convention No. 190.  This will require employment protections as set out in this Bill.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the existing cross-party support for the provision of a statutory entitlement to domestic violence paid leave.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth stated last month that the introduction of this leave is a personal priority for him.  In 2018 Fianna F&aacute;il committed to introduce a statutory entitlement to ten days' domestic violence paid leave.  The Labour party, the Social Democrats, Solidarity - People Before Profit and Independents all expressed their support for the legislation during the Second Stage debate, which was a positive example of the D&aacute;il working together in common cause.<\/p><p>It is important for the committee to note that in both the public and private sector, some organisations and companies have already introduced this leave or are considering the introduction of this leave.  Last year NUIG launched its policy and this has also been in place in Vodafone and Danske Bank.  The need for paid leave from work for a range of reasons, including caring and parenting, is well established, and this piece of leave needs to be added to that.  This legislation is an important addition to existing workplace rights.  It is a workers' rights issue.  It is an issue that affects people at work and it is almost impossible to deal with this issue in the absence of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#A00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for coming before the committee this afternoon to discuss her work on this really important topic.

Who did the Deputy meet and who did she engage with?  Did she engage with any employer representative groups?  If so, what was their feedback?

We had a series of round table engagements.  I will briefly outline the history of this legislation.  It was introduced in the previous D&aacute;il but it fell when that D&aacute;il was wound up.  Up to that point, we had engaged with people who were providing services within the community.  I refer here to people running the refuges as well as representatives of Women's Aid, Safe Ireland and other organisations.  We also engaged with victims and survivors.  Some of that happened organically because once we started talking about this issue, people came to us and that gave us a very real perspective on the issue.  That work was done.<\/p> <p>  Feedback from employers and through employer forums has been very positive.  Vodafone and Danske Bank are leading the way on this.  They have already done it because they recognise a number of important points.  First, in an ideal world, nobody would need this legislation but they have found that in terms of attracting employees, having this leave as part of a suite of measures that make people feel safe at work is very positive.  We also know that Safe Ireland and the National University of Ireland in Galway, NUIG, have conducted research into the cost and there is a cost to employers in not providing this leave.  <\/p> <p>  The reason for the ten days is very simple.  That is what has been done in other jurisdictions.  If one looks at NUIG, it chose ten days which it judged to be both proportionate and fair.  It considered it fair to victims and survivors and proportionate in the context of employers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#B00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy O' Reilly to this meeting to discuss this important Bill.

I congratulate the Deputy on her work and will give way to my colleagues now.

I am delighted to express the support of the Labour Party for it.  We are delighted to support this Bill which is a very important measure in the context of worker's rights and women's rights.  We all know just how gendered the issue of violence in the home and in domestic settings is and indeed, we have been reminded, all too painfully, of that recently with the focus on violence against women in the context of the horrific killing of Ashling Murphy.  We are delighted to support this legislation.<\/p> <p>  I have taken on the role of chairing the Oireachtas Special Committee on Gender Equality which will be looking at other measures to support women in the workplace.  The Labour Party has brought forward a reproductive health-related leave Bill which also builds on the Organisation of Working Time Act structures, as does this Bill.  I appreciate that is why Deputy O'Reilly has used that structure and I take her point about the ten days leave.  <\/p> <p>  I have two questions for Deputy O'Reilly.  She referred to similar leave provisions having been introduced in New Zealand, in some Canadian provinces and in Australia.  Which is the best model?  Has she looked at which is the best of the jurisdictions?  New Zealand is the one we have tended to focus on but is it ten days in all of those other jurisdictions?  Second, given that this committee is currently considering which stakeholders to engage with on this and that Deputy O'Reilly has already done consultation herself, who would be most useful for us to engage directly with in the context of pre-legislative scrutiny?  <\/p> <p>  Again, I wish to express my strong support for this really important women's rights and worker's rights measure.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#B00400","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bacik for her support.  My understanding is that the model in New Zealand is ten days and that is seen as the optimum because it gives enough time for victims and survivors, should they need it, and enough comfort to employers that it will not be excessive.  It also means that it is possible to do a certain amount of planning.<\/p> <p>  On the question of stakeholders, I would see this as being very clearly a worker's rights issue and an employment related issue.  The Chairman of this committee has some experience in this area and she knows from representing workers that abuse can follow them into the workplace.  Very often, people are left without any skills to cope with that.  They do not have the language and do not know what they can offer a person who is a victim.  There may be someone working in an organisation and the shop steward knows or can sense that there is an issue.  However, the shop steward does not know what it is that he or she can practically offer to that person.  In that context, I would encourage this committee to hear from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and specifically its women's committee.  That is not to say that this is only a women's issue but it is an issue that predominantly impacts women.  It would be remiss of me to give the impression that this legislation is only for women because it is not.  It is for all victims and survivors but the sad and awful fact, as we all know because we live in the real world, is that women will be the majority beneficiaries.  I would definitely encourage the committee to talk to ICTU.  I would also encourage the committee to talk to NUIG and Vodafone, which have done this already.  They have stepped ahead and as has been said previously, sometimes politicians are only running along behind the people.  Often the people are ahead of us and we must make that effort to catch up.  People have already arrived at a position where they are asking, \"When?\".  They have established that it is necessary, they understand that it needs to happen and they want to know when it will be done.  <\/p> <p>  I specifically put the provision into the Organisation of Working Time Act because I want domestic violence leave to go in the leave folder.  Anyone who is familiar with human resources offices will know that there is a leave folder in the HR cabinet where organisations keep leave forms and information about the various forms of leave.  I would like this leave to be there, to be mainstreamed.  Perhaps mainstreamed is the wrong word but I am sure Deputy Bacik knows what I mean.  I would like it to be another form of leave, rather than separate or special or one that requires going to a different room to apply.  I want it to be part of the normal leave structure which is why I tried to house it in the Organisation of Working Time Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#B00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I commend Deputies O'Reilly and McDonald on getting this legislation on domestic violence leave to this point.

They had been working with Safe Ireland to analyse the impact on the employer and the &euro;56 billion cost.  They took elements of this legislation and incorporated it into their policy.  I had several meetings with Dr. Duvvury and the human resources department of the university.  I have talked to the people who will be using the policy.  It was incorporated into existing policies.

That is the perspective from which we came to this issue.  This legislation is an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act.  Deputy Bacik has similar legislation.  This legislation is intended to be there as an addition to leave that exists already.  One of the things that does is to bring the conversation from the margins into the centre, which is important because it is a workplace issue.  This issue nearly always affects women.  If a woman is experiencing domestic abuse, she might come into work and be met with a question from a colleague about what she did at the weekend which she does want not to answer because the weekend was hell and she does not want to refer to it.  The colleague asks her again the next week, the week after and the week after that.  Eventually, the colleague stops asking because the woman does not respond but everyone in the office or workplace knows there is an issue.  We are seeking to put this leave in with other forms of leave.  There is no shame in taking parental leave and there should be no shame in taking this leave.<\/p> <p>  Our intention was to house this leave along with other forms of leave that are taken as a matter of course in the normal working year.  The hope is that we would give people the language to not be afraid to talk about it.  I have experience of this as a politician, as has Deputy Ward, and I had experience in my previous life.  People want to help but they do not know how to do so.  This is a practical way to help and it is not separate, different or over there in another corner.  It is a part of the leave arrangement.  It allows us to tell people they have an entitlement to this leave.  This is not a grace and favour arrangement.  I am not offering to go to the boss and tell him or her that X is having a bit of trouble at home.  This is people's entitlement and it is in the leave folder along with all the other forms of leave.  That will avoid any addition to the stigma, shame and marginalisation that someone might be feeling in any event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#C00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I echo everything that others have said about how important and needed the legislation is.  It is brilliant.  I have one or two queries.  I want to avoid being too particular or specific.  If a woman ends up having to go to a refuge a fair way away from her workplace, is there scope within the Bill to cater for extenuating circumstances and allow that woman to apply for additional leave?  Is the amount of leave to be set at ten days, after which a woman cannot apply to extend it even if she was put into a refuge an hour away from her workplace and could not drive or whatever the circumstances might be that would make it impossible?<\/p> <p>  My other questions relate to the scope of the Bill.  If an employee discloses an instance of domestic abuse, will there be a training or information campaign targeted at employers so they know how to manage the situation and understand what is expected of them and what is not expected of them?  In some cases, that might mean ensuring an employer does not overreach and make a situation worse because somebody has disclosed a certain situation.  Is there scope within the Bill to provide support to employers or some sort of information campaign directed at employers so they know how to manage these situations?  I understand what the Deputy has said about the leave being seen in the same way as any other leave but it is hard to know what way an employer will respond to a person saying he or she is taking domestic violence leave.  We must ensure that employers understand what is and is not expected of them in that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#C00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  On the question about flexibility, I will say that the ten days can be broken up.  If a woman's refuge is far away from her workplace, she would have the opportunity to take that leave parcelled up.  I would be open to having a discussion at the next stage about how we could extend it in certain specific circumstances.  That is a worthwhile conversation.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked what is to be done around an information campaign.  Part of ILO Convention No. 190, which I referred to earlier, is on tackling domestic abuse in the workplace.  Part of it states there must be an information campaign.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has said it is his intention to ratify that convention.  I assume and understand that work is ongoing.  If that is ratified, the information campaign comes with it.  However, when there is any form of new leave introduced, the people in human resources departments must get training on how it works.  No matter what kind of leave it is, once new leave is introduced, human resources must get trained on it.  That would be a good time to bring in the information campaign.  We could do simple things such as posters in the workplace and information leaflets in the canteen.  All of that is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  Having the leave in place means that an employee is not asking for a grace and favour arrangement.  The employee is entitled to the leave and the only question is when he or she takes it.  That must be key because it is scary.  It is also scary for people who are in work and see someone in this situation, desperately want to help but cannot think what practical things can be done.  The practical thing that can be done is to show the people concerned the posters in the break rooms and tell them what they are entitled to.  Thereafter an affected person can go to the human resources department and the discretion is there.  As happens with any new form of leave, there must be training for how the leave is applied for and how the applications are handled.  Training in how the confidentiality aspect is handled must be key.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right that people might make a situation worse while trying to make it better.  I see some Deputies nodding because we have all been in situations where we wanted to help but did not know what we could practically do.  This is not the beginning, middle and end of the solution but it is an important piece of the jigsaw to ensure people have a practical means to help anyone affected by domestic violence.  The training that goes along with it will have to be specialised.  It is not a matter of telling someone to log on to a portal and that is how the matter is dealt with.  The training will have to accompany the new leave.  With the ratification of the ILO convention, training will necessarily follow.  However, we do not have to wait.  The discussions we are having today and the discussions the committee will have at a later date will inform public discourse, which means that the more people are talking about the issue, the less it is in the shadows.<\/p><p>The more we shine a light on it the better chance we have of nobody ever having to use this leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#C00600","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I want to join in the call to provide statutory entitlement to domestic violence paid leave.

If the Minister was here I would tell him that I have a Bill that is ready to go, that has been drafted by the parliamentary legal advisers, that has been scrutinised by people in the sector and that I believe will work.  It does not go any further than the proposals I understand are coming from Government.  The difference is one of time.<\/p> <p>  The reason I housed it within the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is that this is a workers&rsquo; rights issue and an issue of leave.  The intention is that the leave would be mainstreamed with other forms of leave and would not be separate, in the margins or in the shadows.  Rather it is intended that it would be a form of leave that one has an entitlement to.  When I think about it I go back to when I was a shop steward and in this situation with somebody in work.  I think about what I could do beyond giving them a cup of tea, a hug and a listening ear.  This leave can be provided.  It is not special leave; it is leave that workers have an entitlement to in the same way as bereavement or parental leave.  Some of us may never use that leave.  In an ideal world we would all be sitting here thinking that is a nice idea but that we do not need this.  However, that is now where we are and this is necessary.<\/p> <p>  My thinking and the thinking of the party on this is that the best vehicle for it is to put it with existing forms of leave.  All of those come from the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and it is about how one organises one&rsquo;s time in work so that it is put as a workers&rsquo; rights issue.  That is not to say it does not have other elements.  It is a housing, health and justice issue and a whole range of Departments are covered but, for me, from the people I have spoken to and from my experience, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 is where one would go for other forms of leave.  I keep using the phrase &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; and I do not mean to because this should not be mainstreamed but the Deputy understands what I mean when I say it is not a separate form of leave that is special over there.  It is here in the folder or book for leave and workers can avail of it because they have an entitlement to it, not because there is a special case being made.  That is the key to it.  From talking to people in the trade union movement, worker representatives and people from human resource departments, their view is that this is the best way to do it simply because it means it is in the same place as other leave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#D00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>For all of us to understand the impact and for anyone watching, could the Deputy outline the impact of similar legislation in jurisdictions like New Zealand and Canada where it is already in place?  It has had a profound impact on people once it has been introduced.<\/p> <p>  In practice, how can we envisage the Bill working?  To an extent it depends on the degree of trust between employers and employees.  I hope we would all envisage that employers would give leave and any allowances they can to employees in those circumstances but the Bill allows for employers to refuse an application for leave if they have reasonable grounds for believing an employee is not entitled to the necessary violence leave concerned.  That is probably a necessary provision as well.  How can we ensure that an already vulnerable person is not denied leave that he or she is entitled to by an employer acting in bad faith?  That might be an unusual scenario but I wonder how it will play out if this leave can be refused.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#D00600","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I was privileged to speak at a conference where I heard from stakeholders from New Zealand.  They said that the practical impact is in place and being able to take time off is in place.  In surveys there, people reported back that they felt like their employers understood and that they did not have to go and bare their souls after having suffered a trauma.  They felt they had that right and that it was given to them as one adult to another.  It was not questioned in the way some might have envisaged it.  As well as that, they pointed to the extent to which a national conversation started.<\/p> <p>  It is not just the legislation, which is important and we agree that it is necessary but it is not just that.  It is the posters that tell people there is a new form of leave.  When changes are made to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 or to other forms of leave a publicity campaign generally goes with that to tell people that their rights in work have changed.  That sparks a conversation at the level of the workplace which could not even be quantified other than to say it has value beyond measure.  That means people are talking so that instead of the victim and survivor being somebody in the workplace who is marginalised, she &ndash; it is not only a female but it very often is &ndash; is then brought into that conversation because people are talking about the new form of leave.  Awareness goes up and along with awareness of the leave the awareness of domestic abuse goes up.  They found that was the value.<\/p> <p>  In practice there is a lot of trust involved in this and there has to be because we are dealing with people who have suffered trauma.  When it is questioned whether somebody might take advantage of this leave when he or she did not need it, I would usually respond by asking someone if he or she would take leave he or she was not entitled to.  I would not and I will answer for Deputy Cairns because I know she would not either.  Deputy Murnane O&rsquo;Connor or Senator McGreehan would not do so either, nor would the Chair.  Who are these people who will take advantage?  This is a specific form of leave and an awareness campaign will nearly police itself.  We cannot retraumatise people by making them tell a story that is personal and that is the cause of trauma in their lives.  I 100% accept that there is an element of trust involved but I have that cheeky response when people ask, which is always to put the question I referred to earlier.  I will not say exactly what I would say but the Deputy can imagine the language I would use.  I would ask people if they would take advantage of this leave if they did not need it.  The universal answer from my experience is always &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I know every member of the committee and in this room agree with me so who are these people?  I do not believe that leave of this nature would be abused.  However, I am not na&iuml;ve enough to believe it could not be abused so there is a mechanism in place, in the way there is for a person who might try to take parental leave when he or she does not have an entitlement to it.<\/p><p>There is a mechanism there for an employer to go to a third party.  There is also a mechanism there for a worker to go to a third party should he or she need it.  We know from the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, following the Zalewski judgment, that all of these hearings have to take place in public.  That is the default.  I would say that there is a compelling case for these hearings to take place not only in private, but quickly.  Again, that involves resourcing the WRC, although I know that I am straying into another area here.  However, there is sufficient reason within the legislation for employers to be relaxed.  We only have to look at Danske Bank, Vodafone and other employers in other jurisdictions that are moving ahead with this anyway, as well as in a positive way.  They are giving positive feedback.  As well as that, we know that the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, NCPC, has said repeatedly that there will be issues around attracting talent to a workplace.  Having a decent set of terms and conditions for the people one is hoping to attract is a good place to start.  Many employers are now waking up to this fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#D00700","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Just to clarify, my question was more about if people were wrongly refused leave, rather than trying to get the leave without needing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#E00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I apologise, I took it as a general question about whether there could be abuse of this.

Like other speakers, I am fully supportive of this proposed legislation.  As the Deputy has said, timing here is crucial.  It is important that we are here today as all political parties that are fully supportive of ten days domestic violence paid leave.  Deputy O'Reilly has said that she has had good responses from Ministers, which is crucial.  We also have to look at timing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy said that there is an accepted lack of workplace awareness around domestic violence.  I think she is right.  When she speaks about leaflets and getting the awareness campaign out there, will funding be needed for that?  If so, we need to make sure that we get it.  Has the Deputy looked at this?<\/p> <p>  In 2021, the Amber Women's Refuge conducted a research piece on the impact of domestic abuse on the workplace.  Some 200 women and men who worked outside the home in Carlow and Kilkenny were surveyed.  I have the findings and I will send them to Deputy O'Reilly.  I wonder if she has contacted many refuges; I am sure she has done so locally.  That is welcome, too.  However, when we get this through, it will be important that we have a national campaign, particularly covering areas such as refuges, where they need more support.  We see that with children as well.  Supports for children are needed because they can be so much affected.  <\/p> <p>  It is important that we get this into all workplaces.  Does the Deputy see any obstacles in her way?  She has mentioned a number of companies and that is welcome.  We need to make sure that every woman who is in a domestic violence situation can access this, so that those ten days paid leave are given to her.  Does Deputy O'Reilly see barriers?  Does she see some companies taking it up and some not?  We have to try to make sure that everyone takes it up.<\/p> <p>  I want to say \"well done\" and that I fully support this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#E00400","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murnane O'Connor.  She mentioned the Amber Women's Refuge.  The Chair of this committee has me fully across all of the work it does.  She has been in touch on a number of occasions to sponsor her and I fully expect that that will happen again.  The Amber Women's Refuge has great support from all of the local Deputies and Senators in the area, just as Aoibhneas has in my own area.  We have engaged with the refuges, because that is where this information needs to get to.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor touched on interesting point.  As a general rule, when there is a new form of leave, there will be an information campaign.  That will usually involve the relevant Department producing the leaflets, the posters, the information and making sure that that gets to the level of the workplace.  The Deputy raises a very good point, which is that we should be looking beyond that, by getting the information to the level of the refuge as part of the information campaign.  I am sure that we have all engaged with the people who are running the refuges.  You will always see an information table or an information stand that has leaflets in the refuges.  We will need to get the information there.  That is important and that is a useful suggestion.  As part as any information campaign, when there is a change, there will generally be national advertisements, as well as local.  They will not just happen at the level of the workplace.  One will generally have national advertisements.  <\/p> <p>  The biggest barrier that will be faced, which I fully accept, is that employers might be nervous about taking this on.  They may wonder how they will afford it.  That has to be part of the awareness campaign.  It is not just a case of \"How can we afford it?\"  It is a case of looking at, as Deputy Murnane O&rsquo;Connor says, the work done by Amber and the other organisations on what the actual costs are.  It will be about looking at how much it costs, as well as how much it will cost to implement it.<\/p> <p>  Although we talk about domestic abuse and gender-based violence as an epidemic or endemic, we also need to remember that these are small numbers at the level of a workplace.  This means, therefore, that we will not see mass disruption within each workplace.  However, we need to listen to employers if they are nervous.  We need to be able to go to where they are at and have that conversation with them.  We need to do this in the context of the actual costs at the level of the workplace to the employer, as well as the cost to the people who are working alongside the victims and survivors when there are unexplained absences.  <\/p> <p>  If someone finds themselves in this situation and has exhausted annual leave entitlement, they may be required to attend court, go to a doctor's appointment, attend an appointment with their solicitor or whatever.  If they have exhausted their leave and do not have any other option, they will find themselves having to ring in at the last minute.  That is very disruptive, whereas with this leave and with the provision of this leave, absences can - not always because of the nature of the leave and how it may have to be taken at short notice - be planned.  This means that an employer can plan.  It means that they will be able to mitigate against any potential impacts.  However, I fully respect the fact that there may be nervousness and anxiousness on the part of employers.  The committee will hear not just from workers, but employer representatives and they can speak of their fears, as well as talk about the positive way that they want to approach this.  I have not encountered any negativity coming from employer representatives on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#E00500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Deputy Murnane O'Connor has touched on a few of my points.

What we do know is that over 20 years, there is a cost of &euro;56 billion to time lost.  I apologise for not having the figure with me.  I thought I had it with me and I will supply it.  I would say to employers that there is a huge value in having the capacity to plan and for this leave being taken in a planned way.  There is also a huge value in the retention of experiential learning.<\/p><p>What you learn on the job, and this could be any job from a barista to a CEO, you have with you and some of it cannot easily be passed on to someone else.  When an employer loses a valued member of the team, the employer does not just lose the physical presence, the hands, the eyes and the physical activity: the experiential learning is lost also.  This can be quite detrimental to a company.  In an ideal world this leave would not be needed at all or it may only be needed or availed of once, but it must be considered in the context of being able to maintain someone over the course of their career, the impact of such leave over the course of that person's career in keeping them in the workplace, and ensuring that the employer does not suffer that loss of experiential learning.  I fully appreciate that this is not an exact answer to the question, but I will get it.<\/p><p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, quite rightly keeps a close eye on the finances, and I would expect that it does, but several State agencies and organisations are already moving ahead in this regard.  NUIG has already implemented this policy.  I launched it last year with Deputy Phelan's colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  NUIG has already moved on this and it is my understanding that all of the universities, or the vast majority of them, have indicated that they will bring this in during 2022.  There is a positivity there and it is great to see the public sector leading the way.  We then need to see not just the bigger organisations but also smaller ones coming to the fore and having their questions answered.  There will be questions and I do not for a moment imagine that this will be plain sailing.  It is another form of leave and I do not believe it is at all grubby to mention the concern for employers around the bottom line but it must be looked at in the round.

Certainly, having talked with people in industry, there is a real competition for talent.  A company having this kind of compassionate policy within its suite of HR options says something about the company as an employer.  It also says something about us as a State if we can do that.

Prior to Christmas, I appeared before the committee wearing another hat.  It is great to have the opportunity to address the committee as a representative of One Family.<\/p> <p>  We know that one-parent families are consistently over-represented in all measurements indicating poor outcomes and poorer well-being, such as poverty, deprivation, employment, homelessness, fuel poverty and poor living standards, all of which are particularly prescient at the moment.  In recent years, there have been multiple independent and Government-commissioned research reports on one-parent families, all of which indicate the poorer outcomes that are experienced and that need to be addressed.  These reports include recommendations from the Joint Committee on Social Protection in 2017, which is referenced in the current programme for Government commitments.  The most recent data from EU survey on income and living conditions, EU-SILC, published last month, shows children in one-parent families are six times more likely to live in poverty than children in two parent families.  We find this to be a shocking indictment on the policies that were supposed to be affecting and supporting one-parent families over the last decade.<\/p> <p>  The research mentioned not only shows the problems, it also offers a range of policy responses and solutions which, if implemented, could reduce child poverty in one-parent families.  I chair the child poverty sub-committee of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures National Advisory Group on Children and Young People.  Dr. Keilthy is also a member of that sub-committee.  We support and reiterate the recommendations of the comprehensive report provided to the Minister last year by this group.  We believe there should be a new national action plan on child poverty, with a specific target to reduce child poverty, as well as measures to improve outcomes for parents and children in one-parent families.  Based on that, we have four main recommendations.  The first is around income inadequacy, which is a core driver of poverty in one-parent families.  The focus of Government&rsquo;s response should be on social welfare income and the deep and persistent problems causes by the absence of a child-centred statutory child maintenance system.  One Family recommends this be addressed by the establishment of such a service and also by benchmarking social welfare rates against the cost of a minimum essential standard of  living.<\/p> <p>  The second recommendation is in regard to childcare.  Parents in one-parent families have an additional burden when it comes to childcare responsibilities, but this is often overlooked by the State.  For example, parents are required to move from one-parent family payment to jobseeker's transitional payment when their youngest child turns seven years old and again from jobseeker's transitional payment to jobseeker's allowance when that child turns 14.  These are arbitrary measures.  They do not relate to the developmental or care needs of the child or the circumstances of the family.  In line with the EU child guarantee framework, we recommend free access to quality, accessible early years and school-age childcare for all one-parent families as part of a wider move to publicly-funded childcare.<\/p> <p>  The third recommendation is in regard to the creation of pathways to education and work.  There are a number of barriers to education and quality employment that are, unfortunately, unique to one-parent families.  These include an emphasis on activation rather than the education needs of lone parents, restrictions on accessing education support schemes based on housing supports and means-testing of grants.  We recommend: tailoring employment and training supports; improving in-work income supports to make work pay, which is vital; supporting lone parents to take up and increase their working hours; and the introduction of a living wage.  We strongly recommend that an education first approach should be taken to activating lone parents and eligibility for grants, specialist bridging programmes and other educational supports should be expanded.<\/p> <p>  The fourth recommendation relates to housing.  We know that one-parent families are much more likely to experience homelessness, housing insecurity and poor quality housing than the rest of the population.  People who are separated or divorced often face specific challenges relating to existing or prior ownership of the family home.  One Family recommends a housing-first approach to increasing the output of built and acquired local authority and approved housing body social housing units to try to address the housing needs of one-parent families.  We also need to make sure that both parents can access appropriate family homeless accommodation should they need it and improve access to support schemes for people who are separated or divorced. <\/p> <p>  I thank the committee members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kiernan.

As pointed out by Ms Kiernan, with poverty rates six times greater than other family types, one-parent families continue to be the group most often helped by SVP.  The high cost of living, lack of opportunity, precarious and low-paid work and underfunded public services limit the options for families in poverty and make it difficult for them to see a way out.  Growing up in poverty means children are missing out on childhood and are being deprived of reaching their full potential.  As well as the individual consequences of living in poverty, the failure to address poverty also brings significant societal costs.  In recent research published by SVP and carried out by Dr. Mich&eacute;al Collins of UCD, it is estimated that the State spends &euro;4.5 billion per annum dealing with the consequences of poverty on people's lives.  To put that in context, this is greater than the respective budgets of housing, justice, transport and agriculture.<\/p> <p>  We can solve child poverty, but we need all Departments to work together to address the structural issues that trap families in poverty.  We echo calls for a new ambitious and comprehensive child poverty plan, with concrete actions across all Departments.  Committing to benchmark social welfare to an adequate level would ensure children have their basic needs met and are not excluded from everyday childhood experiences.  An adequate income would allow families to plan for the future and provide an anchor for parents to access training, education and good-quality jobs.  A living wage and free childcare for low-income families would support parents to build a better life for their children.<\/p> <p>  With housing costs increasingly driving financial insecurity among low-income households, we need Housing for All to deliver on the promise to build more social and affordable housing so that every child can grow up in a secure and safe home.  At the same time, families experiencing homelessness or living in insecure privately rented accommodation and worried about how they will keep a roof over their heads need timely and effective support.  We need a child and family homelessness strategy with a strong emphasis on prevention. A full review of the operation of the housing assistance payment and the impact of unaffordable top-ups to meet market rents is also urgently required.<\/p> <p>  We are currently seeing the impact of rising energy costs, which are putting significant pressure on struggling households.  This winter, SVP has seen a 24% increase in calls for help with utilities.  As well as immediate support for families struggling to keep their homes warm, we need a just transition for children that ensures all can live in warm energy efficient homes regardless of tenure type, surrounded by safe green space to play and connected to their schools, friends and community through an affordable public transport system.  Providing genuinely free primary and secondary education would mean the full participation in education for all children.  At the moment, our underfunded education system is preventing too many children from reaching their potential and is placing families under significant financial pressure at back-to-school time.  We also need targeted supports to help address educational disadvantage, which has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>Getting the policies right and putting resources behind them are critical but ending child poverty must be a top-line priority across government.  We can look to New Zealand, which has shown leadership in this regard.  It has made targets legally binding, established a child poverty unit in the Prime Minister's office to drive implementation from the top and amended its public finance Bill to ensure all budgetary decisions reduce poverty and promote well-being.  This is the type of radical action we need if we are to make an end to child poverty a reality in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to this meeting.  I will address the issue of child poverty from the perspective of food poverty.<\/p> <p>  Clondalkin Cares food bank aims to provide essential food to those who need it now, to support people to address the issues which lead to food poverty and to end food poverty.  In the past two years, we have engaged with over 3,000 people, half of whom were aged under 18.  We currently support about 500 people on a regular basis.<\/p> <p>  Food poverty is defined as \"the inability to have an adequate and nutritious diet due to issues of affordability and accessibility\".  It is estimated that in 2018, 8% of the population experienced food poverty.  With the Covid-19 pandemic, food poverty grew and some estimate it has more than doubled.  Some 71% of those accessing our food bank say the pandemic is one reason they need us.<\/p> <p>  When people contact us we start by assuring them they will get food.  It is not easy to ask for food.  People feel shame and expect to be judged for not being able to provide for their family.  They are scared and under an incredible amount of stress, so we reassure and listen.  We also gather information.  We record as many relevant statistics as possible.  We need to understand what causes food poverty so we can work for change.<\/p> <p>  There will always be people who need food support for a while.  This can be for a number of reasons but many of the reasons we see are systemic and not the result of an isolated incident.  Half of the families state there is not enough money coming in to pay all the bills and buy enough food.  Over one third of families are in debt.  The \"loan man\", paying off catalogues and drug debts feature.  Being in arrears with rent or electricity or taking a credit union loan to cover essentials has become the norm for some people and is sometimes only mentioned as an afterthought.  Some 17% have increased costs for health reasons, such as needing to keep the heat on all the time, travelling costs to appointments and more expensive food.  Some have to go private for assessment of needs or speech and language therapy as the waiting lists are endless.<\/p> <p>  A total of 14% are registered homeless.  It is expensive to be homeless as many do not have access to adequate cooking and storage facilities.  This can also be true for people living in direct provision and we believe there is a hidden number here of people who are struggling but not coming forward.  Some 12% are waiting for a social welfare payment.  Quite new here is that the pandemic is leading to families not receiving children&rsquo;s allowance or a medical card and young adults living on their own not getting full social welfare payments for a long time.<\/p> <p>  People go hungry to make sure their children can eat.  They switch on the heat for a while only when the children are at home.  They choose between paying a bill or buying food.  The constant stress of food poverty cannot be overestimated.  It makes it near impossible to try to address other issues, like looking for a job or dealing with an addiction.  What is especially sad is that many of the children whose parents or carers come to us are fully aware of their situation.  They share their parents' worry, shame and stress.  No child should ever have to experience this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karin Jonsson"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Jonsson and all our speakers.

In this committee, we all strive to introduce targeted measures that have an impact on reducing child poverty.<\/p> <p>  I will first focus on early childhood care and education, referenced by One Family.  My party, Fine Gael, has engaged extensively in this area through its policy lab and produced the Care of the Child document, which provides an enhanced route to early childhood care and education for pre-school aged children and help to prepare a child for starting primary school.  I note that One Family recommends free access to quality, accessible early years and school-age childcare for one-parent households as part of a wider move to a publicly funded childcare system.

What Government response would the witnesses like to see implemented to combat parents' worry and, as Ms Jonsson referenced, the shame and stress of not knowing what food they may have to put on the table in the evenings?

On early years, it is under recommendations from the EU that one-parent families should receive free or extremely low-cost access to childcare.  We are not aware of that being in Government policy or being looked at, but it will be arising in the coming months.  The chair of the national advisory council on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, Tanya Ward, sent the full child poverty paper to the Chair.  It is an 84-page document and is comprehensive in terms of what we would like to see in the poverty plan.  It also addresses food poverty.<\/p> <p>  School meals were mentioned and are critical.

The national childcare scheme provides free hours for families but it is tied, in large part, to a parent's participation in education and employment.  We would like to see it follow the child so all children in one-parent families can access childcare, allowing parents to take up part-time work or education opportunities and focusing on the development of the children in these families.  It is another pillar of the EU child guarantee that all one-parent families have access to free early and school-age childcare.<\/p><p>Currently, in the case of families whose children are approaching 14 years of age and seven years of age, payments change from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's transitional payment and then on to the jobseeker's allowance.  What we see at these stages is that the care needs of those families do not change; they still need access to care for their children.  Investment in school-aged childcare, historically in Ireland, has been low, and that is an area we would like to be addressed such that it will not just be about early years care and education but also about those children who go to school, particularly at those touch points where parents move from one payment to another and are activated back into employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kelly.

Ms Kiernan spoke about this in the context of single-parent households and their needs.  The majority of families with children who access our services are single-parent households.  I hope that work to ensure people do not live in poverty in general will not take too long.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, for those of us who provide food and food banks, there should be more resources out there for us and they should be more easily accessible in order that we would not have to look so much towards fundraising, not quite knowing where all the food is going to come from.  We have been part of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, FEAD, programme since July last year, which is an immense support but, even at that, it provides for about 70 families what I would say is only a very small weekly shopping basket, and we give that out once a month.<\/p> <p>  School meals are essential, as we have seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We supported many local schools in distributing the food and there was a very good uptake on that.  We also saw parents' worry, concern and fear when the summer was coming because they were not sure whether the food would continue.  In some schools, meals are not given to all the children and the kind of food that is given out varies.  Shame comes into that.  If it is only there for the poor ones, that is, those of us who cannot manage, some parents will choose not to access it even if they could do with it.  These breakfast clubs and lunches should be completely open to all those who want them, not for those who qualify, such that the option will be there for every child in the school.  <\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has brought many new families into poverty, that is, those who do not live in delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, areas or families who had never experienced it previously.  If children could have access to breakfast and lunch every day of the school week, that would be a great help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karin Jonsson"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Jonsson.

On the all-of-government approach, the blueprint is there in the form of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures child poverty paper, which outlines exactly which areas require action to address child poverty, whether in education, housing, supports for parents or early intervention.<\/p> <p>  To facilitate the whole-of-government approach, a number of steps can be taken.  From our point of view, it is critical to have a driving force behind tackling child poverty, which we foresee as a child poverty unit being established, co-located between the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Social Protection, that would be tasked with developing child poverty plans, where each Department would have specific actions and targets it must deliver on.  A key part of that would relate to ensuring our budgetary process was attuned to the need to reduce child poverty.  That would involve ensuring all budgetary decisions have been properly poverty-proofed, meaning that, if a proposal were put forward, an assessment would be carried out to see what impact that would have on poverty, while ensuring that all decisions that are made will effectively reduce that.<\/p> <p>  It is about the collective impact of policy decisions, given that sometimes, a decision by, say, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage may improve circumstances for a household but that may be offset by a change in another policy area by another Department.  For example, if social welfare payments increase, this may be negated if differential rent does not increase or if there is not a change there and the person&rsquo;s income is taken in rent.  That is about Departments coming together, discussing the collective impact of what they are doing and asking how they can ensure the budget is addressing child poverty.<\/p> <p>  Ms McGowan might speak to the issue of food poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I will not reiterate what the representatives of the two other organisations said because we are all on the same page.  A couple of issues, both for me personally and for the society, arise.  It is difficult to come to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for help, but imagine that in 2021, people in Ireland were phoning us looking for food.  It is horrendous for us in Ireland to say people are short of food.  It reminds me of Famine times.<\/p> <p>  I have been in the society for a long time, since school, and I can see the different kinds of help people are now looking for.  When I joined, we might have been bringing shopping to houses where people were not able to budget, and we would try to show them that, if they bought a week's shopping, it would be a better use of their money.  Now, people are queuing outside food banks for food when they are short.  The pandemic has definitely exacerbated circumstances.  Children were at home from school, and when that is the case, as anyone who has children will know, the fridge is constantly being opened and food is being eaten.<\/p> <p>  A big issue for us relates to dignity.  It is difficult for people to ask for help where they do not have enough food.  People may have to get it through the FEAD programme, which is of excellent quality but do people really want to have to collect food from a food bank or to be hoping the school would know they are in need?  Hundreds of people come to our food banks and we are quite happy to operate them with our volunteers.  Before Covid, we delivered food in order that people would not have to queue.  During the first lockdown, because we are in every community, other community organisations worked with us, such as the Garda, which was excellent, and GAA clubs.  We are confidential, however, so we need to be really careful in how we deal with people.  The quality of the food is excellent, but one person may not eat rice, for example, and another may not eat pasta.  People are entitled to choice but we hand them bags or boxes of food where there is no choice.  That, to me, is not dignified.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree all schools should be in the school meals programme, not just those in DEIS areas.  In fact, because of Covid, a family might be better off living in a DEIS area because they will get the breakfast club or lunch in school.  We have had more and more people come to us who have been working and, therefore, they would not be living in a DEIS area.  We have had people with mortgages, car loans and energy bills.  There are lots of people who have been working.  As one family said, a single parent, whether a mum or a dad, must try to juggle everything.  Food poverty is a very big issue.  As a society, we will have to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Rose McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for taking the time to come before the committee today and share their experiences of food and child poverty.

There are examples of adults doing that, but we are focusing especially on children.  <\/p> <p>  Waiting lists are long everywhere.  To some extent, in our area they are, at times, especially long.

I have a few questions for the St. Vincent de Paul.  In its recent pre-budget submission, it highlighted in-work poverty among one-parent families and recommended the removal of the cliff edge for working lone parents by extending the cut-off for jobseeker's transition payments until the youngest child reaches the end of second level education.  Could the witnesses describe the difference a measure like that would make?<\/p> <p>  That document stressed the importance of closing the gap between social welfare rates and the real costs facing households.  Could the witnesses elaborate on the importance of benchmarking social welfare payments to an adequate income?  The St. Vincent de Paul discussed the role of income inadequacy of a core driver of poverty in one-parent families.  It highlighted the importance of benchmarking social welfare rates against the minimum essential standard cost of living.  If the witnesses could elaborate on that for the committee, it would be very helpful.<\/p> <p>  The St. Vincent de Paul provides particular insight into the importance of tailoring employment and training supports in enabling lone parents to increase their working hours and gives example of what measures it has in mind.  On that kind of furious and sickened note, do any of the other witnesses want to comment?<\/p> <p>  Even with all of those changes and the different things we could do a terms of budgets and social welfare payments, without State provision of childcare, is it possible to reduce the gap in terms of one-parent families being six times more likely to experience poverty to that extent?  Without childcare provision for one-parent families that is accessible and free will we ever get rid of that?  My mother was a single parent and went out to milk the cows every day.  It is an almost impossible task to go to work when people have children and cannot afford childcare.

The same extends to a variety of other areas.  For example, we know that one-parent families are more likely to be in insecure and poor quality housing.  Without a secure place to live, it is very difficult for families to engage in things like education or get access to employment because they are so concerned about keeping a roof over their heads.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned benchmarking, which is something we see as crucial because without a standard of living that meets people's needs they cannot survive or get by.<\/p><p>They cannot think about anything outside their immediate crisis circumstances.  It is imperative that the payments made to families through the Department of Social Protection are enough to meet their needs.<\/p><p> We see a good example in this regard from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice research over the last number of years.  Social welfare payments to older households, through measures taken at Government level, have been sufficient to meet their needs and over the last number of years those households have fared adequately - I do not want to say well - in terms of social protection.  We see at the opposite end with one-parent families that where families are on working family payment, for example, they are faring particularly badly.  Under the most recent budget, they were seen to come out slightly below the cost of living increases.  The measures are there.  The benchmarking of social welfare is something that can be included in a targeted approach to families, but it needs the other service pieces.  It requires things such as childcare, housing and access to employment and education to be addressed.<\/p><p> In terms of education, there are a number of good schemes available.  Often parents are not made aware of them or they are not given a pathway to enter the schemes for education or even employment.  We hear time and again from parents who say they are being activated into a particular role that does not suit their skills set or that they would like to get back into education to upskill.  To address child poverty families need to be earning a decent wage whereby they can pay for their housing costs and all the costs associated with raising children.  These families want to provide for themselves.  They want to be able to get ahead and to have enough education to build a life for themselves, rather than just constantly relying on social protection.  A key part would be addressing a number of anomalies in the system.<\/p><p> There are a number of issues with regard to education.  For example, the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant is not available for part-time courses.  That is a real barrier for one-parent families, particularly when their childcare needs are taken into account.  There are other anomalies.  If somebody is on jobseeker's transitional payment, JST, or one-parent family payment and is in receipt of rent supplement, the person is automatically moved back to the training and education allowance, which precludes the person from getting a SUSI maintenance grant.  There was a good example last year.  The Minister for Social Protection implemented a law called Catherine's law which stopped the means testing of PhD stipends for people in receipt of disability allowance, yet the means testing still exists for people on one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment.<\/p><p> These are some examples of technical issues in the system that could be ironed out and benefit families, but these small technical changes have to be underpinned by a widespread benchmarking of social protection against a minimum essential standard of living.  The way to achieve that refers back to what Ms Kiernan said about the need for a national child poverty strategy.  All the measures we are discussing today are of value and it is worthwhile looking at implementing them, but without that overarching strategy there is no coherent approach and no protection for children against shocks to the system that could come.  For example, inflation is a big issue at present.  What we need is a concerted effort from the Government that is long-term, sustainable and looks at all these different areas and brings them together.<\/p><p> I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cairns for her question.  As regards the cliff edge, I will add to what Ms Kelly outlined.  In the case of the jobseeker's transitional payment, once the youngest child reaches the age of 14 years, a recipient must either switch to the working family payment or move to jobseeker's allowance.  That means that a lone parent who is working full-time will lose &euro;53 per week simply because the youngest child has turned 14 years old.  The parent cannot take up any more hours because he or she is already working full-time, so there is no way for the parent to increase his or her income.  The parent is left with this loss of income at a time when he or she has a teenager.  Raising teenagers is more expensive in terms of the costs to households.  They are still in school and the parent still has all the care and responsibility.  Extending it until the end of secondary school would mean that the cliff edge at that point is removed.  The children are then over the age of 18 years and perhaps going into college.  They can then move onto other payments at that point, where there is an opportunity maybe to engage with training and there is still income support.<\/p> <p>  Lone parents need the social protection system to recognise their additional caring responsibilities, and they need to be treated differently because of that.  That is very important.  This is a legacy of the drastic cuts and changes to the one-parent family payment that took place from 2014 onwards.  Many of them have been rolled back and we have seen improvements in the living standards of some lone parents, but there are still critical and entrenched issues in terms of how the social protection system and in-work supports are designed for lone parents.  It is a very complex system, so streamlining it would be very effective in supporting lone parents throughout their children's lives.<\/p> <p>  To add to what Ms Kelly said about benchmarking, it is about using evidence to drive how our social welfare system is set.  At present, it is arbitrary and totally inadequate.  There is still a gap of &euro;82 between a social welcome income for a lone parent with two children and the cost of a minimum essential standard of living.  That is why we have issues related to food poverty and that is why families are cutting back and going into debt.  Having a system that is adequately benchmarked and that provides a standard of living for everyone in society, a standard below which nobody is expected to live, would be a progressive and important step in tackling child poverty.  It is not cheap to do and it would require changes over a number of budgets.  However, as shown in the research we highlighted regarding the cost of poverty to the State every year, it is significantly less than that so it is definitely money well spent in terms of preventing the damaging impacts of poverty on people's lives.<\/p> <p>  Childcare is fundamentally critical to ensuring that families can get out of poverty and that they have options and choices.  At the same time, we must ensure that people who cannot work because they are caring for children with additional needs or a disability have an income that they can live on with dignity.  That is why recognising the cost of disability and the full implementation of the recently published Indecon report are also critical to ensure those extra costs are supported through our social welfare system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I agree with the previous speakers.  To add to that, childcare plays a positive and important role in prevention and early intervention with children and families in any situation that might relate to child poverty or issues leading to child poverty.

The sound went on me and by the time I got it back it was too late.  Many of the questions I had intended to ask have been covered.  However, I am always confused by what does not seem to come up very often, especially from a poverty perspective and also when we discuss social welfare.<\/p><p>At some point over the past decade or so, the children's allowance was linked to a child attending school.  It is as though we have automatically accepted this is the case, when it is supposed to be a universal payment.  It was never about education.  Some of the poorest women in some of the most poorly resourced communities often experience children dropping out of school young, at 15, 16 or 17 years of age, before they have completed the leaving certificate.  We seem to have accepted the policy that if people cannot get the children's allowance form signed by a school to state the child is in school the children's allowance is stopped.  This policy impacts some of the poorest families and communities that are already struggling to keep their children engaged in the education system.  Perhaps One Family or the Society of St. Vincent De Paul have experience of this.  I would love to know the views of the witnesses on this and why it has not come up as a contentious point.  It has worked its way into our policy on how we pay children's allowance.  A household with high educational attainment receives a universal payment with much less of a risk of the children dropping out of school or having difficulties in school.  They are probably from professional backgrounds.  We have this universal payment that becomes contingent on your child remaining in the education system.  Obviously there is a desire to keep children in the education system.  Mothers never want children to leave education but it is not always possible to keep them in it and somehow, we have allowed the children's allowance to be attached to it.  Do the witnesses see this as an issue with regard to the discussion on child poverty?  I would love to know the witnesses' views on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#L00400","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>As Dr. Keilthy has outlined, we support the extension of the jobseeker's transitional payment until-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>No-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#M00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I understand the question but it is a similar point.

It should be for the course of a childhood rather than linked to the educational attainment of the young person.  It echoes the changes to the one-parent family payment, with fairly arbitrary age requirements put on payments that actually do not reflect the reality for families.  Often they disproportionately affect the lowest-income families.  We definitely support what the Senator is saying in that it should be available to all children under the age of 18.  It is not something on which we have been campaigning.

It is a good point.  It is not something that comes up frequently in our services.  It is not something on which we have focused.  It does complicate things when a letter has to be signed.  There were issues over the summer when parents were not able to get the letter signed and there was a loss of child benefit.  This is a huge loss for families on low incomes.  An issue that is raised consistently with regard to child benefit is the loss of child benefit once a child turns 18, even if that child is still in school.  Now that we have transition year and children begin school at six, they are much more likely to be 18 - definitely in sixth year and perhaps in fifth year.  The loss of child benefit at that time is massive for families.  We have seen it contribute to early school leaving.  Child benefit should be payable for all children until the end of secondary school.  The cut-off at the age of 18 has an impact on families.  It is an issue that is raised with us quite frequently.  In our prebudget submission, we called for child benefit to be available until children finish secondary schools.  This is what we have seen in our services and supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>Perhaps it is this concept that all of a sudden meant it was attached to asking schools to sign the form.  When I went to school, I never had to bring a form to the school to prove I was in school so my mother could collect the children's allowance.  It is like the decision was made at a policy level.  It is something new in the past 17 years.  I am trying to think of the age of my daughter and when it started and stopped throughout her lifetime.  I agree the payment should not stop at the age of 18 particularly when children start school later.  In one sense we are arguing that it should be to the end of second level.  This is then in the psyche of policymakers, who attach access to it to being in the education system.  To some extent they need to be uncoupled from a policy perspective in order that we do not disenfranchise women.  It probably is not raised because people have just accepted that they no longer receive the children's allowance because the child does not go to school.  They have also accepted it as a policy intention without there ever having being, in my understanding or memory, a conversation about it.  Everyone has just accepted it.  It is something we need to start bringing to the fore again for the women in my community who no longer receive children's allowance because their children are having such difficulty attending school.  If anyone needs to continue to have support, it is families in this situation.  It is about naming it as an issue.  For politicians and advocates from a policy perspective, it would be a good time to look at where it came from and why it happened.  If it is just a ministerial order, it should be undone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#M00600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who has spoken today.  It is very important that we highlight issues with child poverty.  It is very hard to think of children in poverty.  In Carlow I have been very involved with a group of people and we set up our own food bank.  We call it St. Clare's Hospitality Kitchen.  We provide up to 80 meals a day.  During Covid we had to buy in meals.  We also give out a lot of food parcels.  I have seen at first hand families who are working and paying their bills and who find it very hard to survive at the end of the week when they have absolutely nothing left.  They look for a food parcel.  We have to be very careful because there are situations where families are working but they end up with nothing left particularly when they pay their bills.  We are always mindful of this.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  According to the opening statement, in 2021 its regional office received more than 191 requests for help and almost 70% of these requests were from families with children.  Do the witnesses believe this is an accurate figure?  I believe from working in the community that there are families with children who need support but who do not look for it.  Do the witnesses feel this is an issue?  Is it something they often come across?<\/p> <p>  Another area I want to speak about is child support.  Domestic violence has been very much part of the pandemic and the issue has been highlighted in recent weeks.  It is an issue that we need to highlight.  There should be more supports for children in this situation.  We need to put supports in place, whether through schools or families.  There should be supports for children affected by it.  Are there enough counselling services?  Do children get support?  Does the system miss children who need these supports but we are not aware of them?<\/p> <p>  I want to raise another issue, which I have discussed with the Minister.  I have been calling for action on it for the past eight months or a year.  I know of families who left schools because they do not qualify for DEIS status.<\/p><p>There were no hot meals programmes or breakfast clubs.  Some families are now sending their children to schools where they can access hot meals.  We are living in a type of society where we must ensure, and I have been calling for this to happen, that all schools have these programmes, whether they are categorised as DEIS or not.  We have been waiting months for the completion of the Minister's review of DEIS status.  Schools have applied to the Minister for DEIS status because they are in disadvantaged areas.  There has been no report on this subject yet, but I will keep working on it and continue to ask the Minister about it.  <\/p><p> All schools, no matter what areas they are in, must now consider providing hot meals, because some families cannot afford hot meals themselves if they are paying a bill.  The parents may be making sacrifices themselves, as was said, but if their children were in a school with a hot meals or breakfast programme, then they would at least know they were being fed.  Everybody must be able to avail of these programmes.  It is important that no children should feel that they are the exception for getting food when others are not.  We must be mindful of that aspect.<\/p><p> Turning to the subject of lone parents, I have a major issue with local authorities not building two-bedroom houses.  Lone parents on the local authority housing lists come to me, and these are people paying their rent with the housing assistance payment, HAP, and doing their best.  They are being told, however, that no two-bedroom houses are available.  We must get all the different agencies working together and undertake joined-up thinking.  In addition, however, we must ensure that we are building houses, because we do not want to see children living in flats or rented accommodation in the context of HAP.  If a house is sold, people can become homeless within three months.  Therefore, one-parent families must be given more security.  We must work on this issue in conjunction with other areas and bring about joined-up thinking in this regard.<\/p><p> We all know it has been hard during the pandemic.  The only good thing the Covid-19 pandemic has done is to highlight the failings in our system, and especially those things that have not been highlighted enough previously.  It is sad, in 2022, to have food banks, and endeavours such as St. Clare&rsquo;s hospitality charity food kitchen in my area.  We really should not have anyone living in poverty, and we must make this issue a priority for the Government.

We have only been involved in food bank provision since the end of March 2020.  It is not that families working or with a mortgage were not availing of the food bank before, but a larger proportion of them are now.  When they come to us, they tell us they have paid their bills.  A young couple who came to us recently told us the husband&rsquo;s money goes to pay the rent and the wife&rsquo;s money goes to pay the bills, and there is nothing left for food.  The couple do not have children, but that is their situation.  If they had children, their situation might be even worse.  Families also come to us who have paid their mortgages and then have nothing left.<\/p> <p>  Some of the people we are seeing now have never had to look for help before, so they find it very difficult to ask for help in the first place and then to find it.  They have never looked for help with food before, but, equally, they may not have had to seek help with mental health or parenting issues either.  The closure of the schools made things very difficult for some parents when children were taught at home through Zoom.  Some of them came to us and said they had never had to look for help before.  Now they do, and they said they were finding it hard to get the help they needed because the process was labyrinthine and difficult.  That is certainly true.<\/p> <p>  Another thing that has affected people who come to the food bank because of the impact of Covid-19 is the delay in social welfare payments.  I refer to the delay in the registration of children, which in turn leads to delayed payments of children&rsquo;s allowance and the provision of medical cards.  We have seen some families who have just received a bill from the hospital for their baby.  They have paid the bill, because they always pay all their bills, and have no money left.  They did not have to pay the bill, but they did not know that because they have never had to worry about such a situation that much before. <\/p> <p>  Equally, young adults who have not reached the age of 24 cannot automatically receive the full rate of social welfare payments.  There are ways around that situation, but it takes a long time, and much longer now.  One young adult accessing our services has &euro;112 a week.  His parents died during the last two years and he is still living in the family home.  He is being supported and helped to try to resolve these issues, but it is taking time.  It is time that people do not necessarily have when they need food to eat or to have to pay their heating bills.

They may feel that they just could not take the last step to make a phone call.  In every radio and newspaper interview we have done during the pandemic, we have made certain to say that the only criterion to get our help is need.  We have emphasised that people should not be afraid to come to us and we have asked them to do so.  Some people, however, will always be uncomfortable coming to St. Vincent de Paul.  Many more people are living in poverty than the 190,000 calls we receive.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the DEIS schools, I agree completely with Deputy Murnane O&rsquo;Connor.  I have spoken to people who enrolled or moved their children to a DEIS school.  It was not only due to the availability of free meals in those schools, but also because classroom sizes are smaller and other supports are available.  Therefore, this whole area must be explored.  Regarding the food aspect, and to give an example, we had a call just before Christmas from a home school liaison teacher.  We work closely with schools and the home school liaison system is wonderful.  That teacher, who was in a DEIS school, was working with 12 families who would not access help through us, because they said the neighbours would know, etc.  We just put 12 bags of food into the boot of the car and delivered them to the school, with toys and books and other things.  The activity operated through the system in confidence.  <\/p> <p>  We advised that teacher to sit down with those families in the new year.  It was not possible to visit houses, so what she was doing during the year was having families come into the school one day each week.  She could not visit their houses on the other days.  Now, she is going to work with those families to let them know there are many ways of getting support, even if they do not want us to come out to them.  We have childcare facilities in our resource centres, and that shows how important access to childcare is.  People trust the teachers in our childcare facilities and resource centres.  A rapport is built up, and that means people can access many more things as a result.  Teachers refer people to us and explain what our conferences, which are our branches, do.  It might involve help with food, school or whatever.  <\/p> <p>  A great many people are living in poverty and, as the Deputy said, it is not always social welfare payment recipients.  During the first full lockdown, people working had some savings, but they used them all up.  There are no savings now.  A couple who had both been working came to us recently.  They had both lost their low-paid jobs.  One had been working in the hospitality sector.  They got the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for which they were grateful.  A two-bedroom cottage in the inner city of Dublin cost them &euro;1,800 a month.  That was the first thing that had to be paid, and then the rest of their bills.  Those two people, who had been working, came to us wondering if we had food.  We of course told them to come to the food bank and we helped with a bill, etc.  They had no children, but that woman did not realise that we would help with a bill for electricity.  It is something for us to look at as well in respect of trying to ensure that we get more information out about what we do.<\/p><p>The woman decided to do an online course during Covid to upskill.  We helped with the purchase of a laptop.  That girl came at Christmas to the food bank to collect because we were doing food plus Christmas food.  She came with a box of chocolates, so grateful that we had supported them.  They kept their home and kept their bills going.  It is to be hoped that in light of the announcement last Friday, they will both be back at work.

I wish to address the Deputy's question on family supports and domestic violence.  It is not an exaggeration to say there is a crisis for children and their parents in the context of domestic abuse and child abuse and the impact on them.  We are learning things now that will haunt us in decades to come in terms of the impact on children.  What is there is incredibly insufficient.  I refer to the very comprehensive paper on child poverty produced by the council on Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  There are 11 different areas of concern, one of which is on family support.  There is a reason for that, as Ms Jonsson explained earlier.  Social welfare rates here may seem high compared with those in other countries but our universal services are very low, so people here have to pay privately for so many things.  Prevention, early intervention and family support services, particularly for families experiencing domestic abuse, are critical.  We work with one-parent families but people are sharing parenting post-domestic violence and in many cases the domestic abuse continues through into contact visits and sharing.  In some cases, ongoing abuse and damage is being done to children and their parents.  This may be a family law reform issue, and we can discuss that another day, but it is linked to poverty as well.  I will hand over to Ms Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I will address a couple of the other areas the Deputy mentioned.  She referred to the hot school meals programme.  I agree that it should be available more widely and that it is a key way to tackle food poverty among families with whom we work.  The Deputy's point in respect of DEIS schools is key.  This relates not just to hot school meals, but to all supports offered through DEIS.  We know that more than half the children who are experiencing disadvantage are not in a DEIS school and do not have access to those supports.  We would like to see a system that follow the child so that the children who are disadvantaged but in a non-DEIS school would still have access to those supports.  We would like schools that do not have cooking facilities to be able to access the national development plan to retrofit the schools and get better cooking and dining facilities.  The introduction of a hot school meal programme in a school has a twofold effect on food poverty.  The children get fed in school, but they also may be able to participate in the preparation of food and see the preparation of healthy food.  That has a kind of sustainable impact on food poverty.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's remarks on local authority housing.  The UN rapporteur on housing spoke last year in Ireland and particularly highlighted the impoverished living conditions of one-parent families.  In recent years, it has become an increasingly big issue for the families with whom we work.  They have lower rates of home ownership, but also poorer quality of housing.  In the context of homeless figures, one-parent families feature heavily.  They make up approximately 20% to 25% of families in Ireland but, up until last summer, they represented approximately 50% to 60% of families living in homelessness.  I highlight to the committee that the figures on homelessness have not been disaggregated since last summer for two-parent and one-parent families.  That is leaving us a little blind and we would like it to be changed such that the figures are divided and show us the picture in respect of one-parent families.<\/p> <p>  A policy blind spot in terms of housing and throughout the system is that of shared parenting families.  We see families where there might not be a formal custody arrangement but dad has custody of the children for half the time and enters into homeless accommodation but cannot access appropriate accommodation for their children.  The same is true throughout the housing system.  Shared parenting families find it very difficult to access housing for both parents that is suitable for the children.  That is really important to maintain the shared parenting relationship.  Throughout the system, shared parenting is very much a blind spot.  When it comes to housing, social protection and all other areas, people are viewed as either a lone parent or a single adult.  That has detrimental effects for the children.<\/p> <p>  In terms of housing policy, we support what the Deputy said.  We definitely need more accommodation built by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  We would really like to see a reduction in the over-reliance on the private rental sector to provide social housing.  This is a big problem for the families with whom we work because, as all present are aware, top-ups are an issue and the rate of housing assistance payment, HAP, does not always meet the full needs of a property.  For a one-parent family, trying to meet that top-up payment is an additional burden.  One-parent families are further disadvantaged compared with two-parent families in that situation.  As part of, or linking in with, an overall child poverty strategy, we would like to see a family homelessness strategy that addresses some of these concerns and some of the issues arising for one-parent families.  Such a strategy would need to speak to and interact with a child poverty strategy such that the two are aligned and working towards the same goals on housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Niamh Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I am sorry that I am, unfortunately, coming late to the meeting.  I was in the Seanad.  I did not get to hear most of our guests' presentations but I am very familiar with the work they do.  Indeed, I sent many families to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul through the years and I thank its representatives for all they do in respect of food poverty for families.  There are so many wonderful organisations out there, particularly in County Meath, where there is the Meath Food Bank.  Ken Smollen in Offaly does great work and delivers to 1,200 families every single month.  There is real child poverty out there.<\/p> <p>  Wearing my other hat, before I was a Senator, I was a county councillor but I also was a foster parent.  I saw real child poverty coming through my door on many occasions.  The first thing you noticed was the food the children ate and the personal grooming of the children in poverty.  As a person from a stable background with full family support, you could tell the children who came from an impoverished household.  From their personal grooming and their diet, you could tell that money was not around to support the child growing up into a health lifestyle.<\/p> <p>  What we really need are far more supports for families and parents.  How do we support these parents to help them be better parents and guardians of children?  If we do not get that right, we will never be able to fix the issue in respect of poverty.  We have to train parents to be better parents.  There is family support available from Tusla but people run a mile from that organisation.  They do not want to get involved in that even though the supports are there for families.  They just do not want to pick up the phone to call Tusla and tell it they are struggling and need help.<\/p><p>The type of housing is a major consideration with child poverty, as well as the communities in which these people live.  I agree 100% with Deputy Murnane O'Connor about a hot meals programme being available in all schools.  There are people we might think are not impoverished but I assure the committee there are examples in middle class Ireland as well.  They pay all the bills but they may not have the necessities to feed their family.<\/p><p> I had an issue with one particular child who came into my care.  I will not give a name but she was a 12-year-old girl.  I would never have considered the issue but she came in with a hoodie and tracksuit bottoms.  She had no other clothing because she came in the middle of the night.  The following day, after getting to know her a little bit, I went shopping with her.  She told me she is not like the other girls in her class because she does not have any money to get her hair or nails done or wear nice clothes.  Everything is a hand-me-down.  She said she does not identify as a boy or a girl yet.  I said \"look it, you are just you for now\".  I brought her into a shop and the first section she went to was the girls' clothing, where she picked out all these lovely girls' clothes she wanted to buy.  I never really thought that poverty could play a part in determining one's gender in life.  She was wearing hand-me-downs from her brother and that is all she was getting at home.  She had not looked for girls' clothing as a result.  As soon as she got the opportunity, she went to buy the little tops and cardigans, along with a pair of trousers.  I wondered if children are choosing a gender because they are living in poverty.  Could that be a reason for children having gender identity issues?  I never really associated poverty with gender identity issues until that very moment.  It was certainly an eye-opener for me.<\/p><p> I do not know how we can address that.  Is there a programme for young girls so we can support them with clothing appropriate to their age?  I know there are various charity shops, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Do they get much clothing for young teenage girls or is it mainly for adults?  Perhaps the witnesses could address those matters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#O00400","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Before having the witnesses reply, I wonder if Senator Erin McGreehan is on the call.

In Ireland, we have gradually moved to a more positive parenting structure.  An example of where we are not doing it, however, is the child benefit issue raised by Senator Ruane earlier, which is a punitive measure on the child and parent.  Much of the structure we have, whether it is in the voluntary sector, Tusla or the HSE is predicated on positive parenting and supporting people to do their very best.  It is a massively under-resourced sector compared with other countries in terms of getting a focus on prevention and early intervention right.  Tusla has a very difficult job because it has so many crises that are expensive to deal with.  We know that if we invest universally for children in family supports, it brings much better results.<\/p> <p>  We can look at Scandinavian countries, where parenting support is not stigmatised.  That is because every parent, whether it is a first or fifth pregnancy, does a parenting programme.  It is completely universal and non-stigmatising.  The voluntary organisations are funded in a way to support people with parenting challenges and the state has a different role in terms of supporting the child and keeping them safe.  There is perhaps more of a distinction than we have in Ireland and that is one way in which this could work well.<\/p> <p>  One Family is 50 years old this year and we were set up as Cherish back in 1972 and we still work with many women who do not want to be pregnant or be parents but who end up parenting.  That is a really difficult position and there are frequently not the kind of therapeutic and practical supports for them and their child that would allow them to bond and have a lifelong relationship.  A reluctant mother is not spoken about widely but such people are real.  They exist and this can happen in any socioeconomic background.  It is important that infant and mental health services continue to be supported and built on in this country.<\/p> <p>  The Senator had a question about transgender young people and queries about gender identity.  I know from my own life that this is a very complex area and, with respect, I suggest it is not linked to the availability of clothing.  It is probably a little more complicated than that but it may be that a young person was perceived to be male or teased as being male because of clothing.  That may not relate specifically to gender identity, although it is possibly a discussion for a more expert organisation, such as BeLonG To.  It would be very helpful in that area.<\/p> <p>  My main concluding message is that we believe there is a very valuable and comprehensive report on child poverty that has been prepared and made available to the Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and this committee.  It lays out the structure, research and 11 areas of focus, with recommendations under each one.  That is the pathway to developing a national child poverty action plan, which is what we need in Ireland.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is currently leading with the EU Child Guarantee and an action plan to go with that, it is somewhat small-scale.  The funding coming from that is small-scale compared with what we need.  We need a higher level national child poverty action plan and we really hope the committee will be able to support the development of that in partnership with us and others over the coming months and years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen Kiernan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>We received that report and it was circulated to members.

We can speak to our experience of parenting support.  We conducted research in 2018 involving interviews with 30 families living in poverty.  That indicated in detail their experience of living below the minimum essential standard of living.  For those parents, there was much shame and guilt associated with their children growing up in poverty.  They did everything they could to minimise the impact of poverty on their children's lives, trying every way they could to ensure they were able to do what other children take for granted, such as going on school trips, having nutritious food when they could afford it and things like that.  There was much feeling of guilt in those parents when they had to say \"no\" to their children.<\/p> <p>  We asked the parents what they wanted or what would help their situation.  Across the board, it was really about good quality jobs, being able to access training that would support them in getting better quality jobs and almost every family said childcare was the number one need.  In our experience, it is a lack of income and not a lack of parenting ability that influences a child's experience of poverty.  Those parents just need the right supports at the right time to ensure they can build a better life for their children.  That is really about ensuring we have affordable childcare and affordable housing that is accessible and of good quality.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a really important point around standards.  We see families who are in very poor-quality accommodation.<\/p><p>Due to the current state of the market, they feel they have no other option but to accept very substandard accommodation, in particular in the private rental sector.  We need to ensure housing is of good quality, as well as being affordable, because energy poverty is a very real issue for many families.<\/p><p> We spoke about food poverty a lot, and we see it in almost every facet of community organisations.  It is a symptom of wider issues.  In our experience, when times are tough, the one area families have discretion over is the food budget.  It comes down to addressing the drivers of food poverty, such as low pay and inaccessible public services, and ensuring that families are supported.  The blueprint is in the Better Outcomes, Brighter Future paper.  We know what policies are needed.  We know what the problems are.  It is now about taking action and ensuring that the resources are there to address this for once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022012500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>It is expensive to be poor.  People cannot bulk buy or afford energy bulbs.  People may not have transport and instead have to do their shopping in a corner shop or nearby convenience store because they cannot access larger supermarkets where prices might be cheaper.  That is a hindrance.<\/p> <p>  There are lot of things many people could do, such as learning about budgeting, cooking and storing food, but as long as people do not have surety of food now, a home or the ability to pay an electricity bill, there is no way they can focus on those things.  We need people to escape the immense stress and trauma of not having the very basics.  When security is there and the stress is lifted, we can then start talking about the things that might make life even better, such as training, education, cooking, budgeting, giving up cigarettes or whatever else it might be.  That is not something people can deal with when they do not know if they are going to have an enough food tomorrow or be able to heat their houses.<\/p> <p>  This is a long-term process.  Policy changes and changes in society will help, as will the work local organisations can do to support people.  It is not going to happen overnight, even when we work with families.  They need to build trust with us and befriend us, which takes time.  When we give that time and put in that effort, things can change fundamentally for a family and the next generation.<\/p> <p>  The girl to which a Senator referred reminded me of one thing we have noticed, namely, period property.  We have linked in with an organisation addressing period poverty Dublin a couple of times, which is great.  When we have funds, it is something we can spend some money on because we notice how very popular and important those items are.  They may not seem very expensive, but in many families women and girls are not getting enough period products.<\/p> <p>  I thank everyone for their invitation and being able to share some of our information and stories.

I am pleased, therefore, to introduce the following draft order to this committee - the Technological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) Order 2022.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, an appointed day for the establishment of a technological university, TU, and its name in both English and Irish shall be made by order.  The order must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the matter today in committee.  I wish to set 1 April 2022 as the appointed day for the establishment of the new technological university to be known as Atlantic Technological University in the English language and Ollscoil Teicneola&iacute;ochta an Atlantaigh in the Irish language and for the dissolution of Galway-Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of a fourth technological university in the State is another important milestone for higher education in Ireland, in particular for the west and north west regions.  The new TU will provide a multi-campus university presence across the region encompassing eight locations in Castlebar, Galway city, Killybegs, Letterfrack, Letterkenny, Mountbellew and Sligo.<\/p><p>This new technological university will increase higher education access, drive enhanced regional development and increase opportunities for students, staff, business and enterprise, as well as local communities.  The new higher education institution of increased scale and reach will benefit students and communities right across Connacht and Ulster.  I very much look forward to this new TU bringing those benefits to people in the region, from its most westerly point to its most northerly, and all points between including in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Roscommon.  The new TU will now take its rightful place in the higher education landscape in an important strategic part of the country, bordering as it will both the Atlantic and Northern Ireland.  Its establishment will allow people in the furthest-flung corner of the island obtain, through digital connectivity, a university degree in their home places.  I am delighted to see this milestone being reached and I want to congratulate all involved.<\/p><p> The Government has a clear ambition to create a series of interlinked higher education institutions of greater capacity and reach across all regions of the country in order to help deliver on key national strategic objectives.  TUs are a key component in this strategic approach.  They provide increased reach, international recognition, greater research capacity, foreign direct investment, FDI, attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and opportunities and advanced socioeconomic progression.<\/p><p> From April, the new Atlantic Technological University will start its journey and drive the agendas of higher education access, excellence in teaching and learning, regional development, research-informed educational provision and strengthened linkages with industry and the community.<\/p><p> We all want to ensure prosperity for this generation, which is so affected already by the Covid-19 phenomenon, and for future generations.  We want to ensure they have the foundational skill sets and qualifications to compete and succeed in a hugely altering and highly competitive world.  I thank all concerned, including the staff and students of the Institute of Technology Sligo, IT Sligo, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, a wide variety of stakeholders in the west and north west, the international advisory panel, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQI, and the Department.  All the aforementioned bodies and people played a key role, statutory and non-statutory, in getting the fledgling new university to this point of establishment.

The Minister of State knows I have a particular interest in the Atlantic Technological University and I think it is a great name for it.  As he is aware, it is also important, that we have a proper sustainable funding model and we will have an opportunity to do that when the Cassells report comes back.  I ask that he speak to that.  We are expecting both the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to appear before the committee on 10 February.  It is very important we have that published as soon as possible in order that we can get the funding model right because unless we get that model right for the technological universities, they will not fulfil their potential.  The expectation along the Atlantic economic corridor is that this will be a real catalyst for change in terms of what it can provide in respect of developments in renewable energy and research and development on that.<\/p> <p>  When we look at research and development, we know the technological universities have not fulfilled their potential and we need to look at what they need in order to be able to do so.<\/p><p>We know those in Waterford, Cork and Dublin have probably been the best performers but only 0.2% of Ireland's total, or &euro;1.9 million, has been drawn down by the combination of the Atlantic Technological University.  Particularly in terms of the challenges of climate change and what we can do in regard to renewable energy along the western seaboard, it is important we have those proper discussions on the funding they need to be able to lever the huge amount of money that is available through Horizon 2020.<br\/><br\/>We know that since 2014, Ireland has drawn down more than &euro;1 billion worth of research funding, &euro;618 million of which was by the third level institutions.  We must really concentrate on what we need to do in that regard.  How will the Minister of State make sure that happens?<br\/><br\/>I am concerned about the public private partnership, PPP, contracts for all of the investments in technological universities, particularly as we have not carried out a proper evaluation of the couple that have been done before.  I believe it is approximately ten years ago since they were done under Fianna F&aacute;il.  We need to do a further examination of that model to see if we are going to deliver value for money and whether it is the best vehicle.  I do not believe it is the best vehicle for us to achieve what we need around third level.  I am concerned that we will end up with a privatised situation where the academic element will be public but many of the ways in which we deliver third level education will be dependent on the public private partnership.  I want to see the evidence for that.  One contract that was signed in 2020 was valued at almost &euro;600 million.  We are talking about an awful lot of money here.<br\/><br\/>This is quite technical but with regard to the amalgamation of St. Angela's College with the Atlantic Technological University, amendments will needed to the higher education authority Bill.  They need to be <i>in situ<\/i>before 1 April, however.

It is an experience that other countries have gone through.  Scotland is one example.  It undertook a fair degree of revision in its curriculum for excellence model and changed its assessment approach.  Over time, it made further changes that moved it back towards a more traditional assessment model.  The experience that Scotland seems to have had is that some of the reforms it would have liked to have seen, both in the curriculum and changes in teaching in the classroom, including the encouragement of 21st-century skills, have not developed as much as they would have liked.  Some of the international writing on this suggests that unless the assessment model is aligned with the curriculum and the pedagogical approach, then the sort of reform that we would like to see does not carry through effectively.  We need to think creatively about how we approach things like assessment.  In more recent years we have seen, either with new subjects or updated specifications to existing subjects, other assessment models coming in which would be regarded as more equitable because it is a different way to demonstrate skills and other competences beyond the traditional sit-down written examination.  We need, however, to think about both new subjects and about looking at existing subjects.  In the case of some of the large ones that all students take, such as English or maths, there is nothing beyond the written papers at present.  Everyone is effectively sitting those exams.  We need to think about whether there are ways to develop other ways to demonstrate skills.  That would be a more equitable system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Obviously the challenge for us in all of the committee's discussions is that they will make a difference and that the changes that are suggested across the board and agreed will be implemented.

Through a series of guidance through 2020 and 2021, therefore, we directed schools in the types of supports they could provide in terms of resources, work that students could have done at home or indeed, in a synchronous or asynchronous capacity, how schools could engage with ensuring that students continued with their learning during that period.<\/p> <p>  For schools, we obviously had teachers who were specialists at post primary.

This is at every level and for every child.  It would not be specific to those with special needs or those at risk of disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  At early years, for example, we have the concept of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, as a learning area.  Digital skill development within the early childhood sector would be supported in that concept.  In terms of primary then, we have the revised primary language curriculum, which promotes digital literacy as an important aspect of children's learning and aims to supports children's abilities to engage with technology to acquire, comprehend and communicate knowledge in a variety of contexts.  A key aspect of the revised curriculum is the development of digital literacy and the child's ability to select, locate and critically analyse relevant information in multiple modes.<\/p> <p>  We have the primary maths curriculum development, which is ongoing.<\/p><p>Part of that takes account of developments in digital technology.  Specifically, it points to the potential technology affords in bringing real world applications to life in the classroom, helping to deepen mathematical understanding and connect mathematical learning to the real world.  <\/p><p>The primary curriculum framework outlines that being a digital learner is one of seven key competencies.  The key competencies play a significant and central role in children's learning as they are intended to be embedded across all curriculum areas and subjects from junior infants to sixth class through the learning outcomes.  The competency of being a digital learner seeks to support children to become curious, creative, confident and critical users of digital technology.  <\/p><p> The framework for junior cycle includes a set of 24 statements of learning which are central to the student experience in junior cycle.  Statement No. 24 focuses explicitly on digital technology.  The framework for junior cycle 2015 sets out eight key skills which support student learning across the curriculum.  The key skills are embedded in the learning outcomes within each junior cycle subject and short course and they include a focus on the four Cs of communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.  The junior cycle also provides students with opportunities to undertake specific digital short courses in digital media literacy and coding.  <\/p><p> At senior cycle, the NCCA has recently conducted a review of senior cycle which involved an extensive process of research and consultation and provided insights into the importance of digital skills for all school leavers.  The current senior cycle curriculum supports the development of digital skills in a variety of ways across the four programmes offered, including transition year, the leaving certificate vocational and applied programmes and the  leaving certificate established.  We have also recently introduced computer science at leaving certificate level.  <\/p><p> The digital curriculum is learning outcomes-based and it has already been reformed at junior cycle level.

It is really good to hear enthusiasm in the Department's approach to this.<\/p><p>We know that leaving certificate reform is urgently required, particularly in light of all that has happened over the past couple of years.  One of the silver linings of what happened over the past couple of years is the acceleration of digitalisation and the move to doing a great deal more online.  In our work life, as well as our study life, we have moved to a process of doing more things online, to looking at more flexible ways of learning and, as highlighted, the importance of continuous assessment.  We have heard from previous contributors of the importance of ensuring we have a fair and balanced examination process.<\/p><p> Will Mr. Tattan outline the three top opportunities for students in this reform?  In other words, from the point of view of the Department of Education, taking into account its positive approach in this, what are the three top opportunities that would benefit students ahead?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#P00600","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  One of those opportunities is something we have touched on already, namely, the provision of different sorts of diversity of opportunities for students to be able to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and competencies.  That would be helpful, if we could achieve it.  Other countries and other systems have managed to do that.  As I mentioned earlier, for some of the newer subjects and in updating the specifications of existing subjects, we have sought to try to bring in other forms of assessment, including digital assessment.  We can leverage that more while still ensuring fairness.  We have to ensure that there is fairness, accessibility, equity and so on.  That is one real opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Sticking with the assessment piece, a second opportunity is around spreading the assessment load.  I spoke earlier about the stress that students face, and in terms of feeling that all of their eggs are in the one basket of a written examination in June.  We could consider opportunities that would help to alleviate that.  This happens to some extent already in the context of music orals and practicals, and other forms of practicals, which happen at times other than in June.  There are elements of that within our existing system, but there may be ways to enhance that further and to spread the load such that students would not face a lot of high stake things coming all at the one time.  <\/p> <p>  A further opportunity outside of assessment is, perhaps, integration.  We have a number of programmes at the moment.  We have the leaving certificate established, which the vast majority of students undertake.  We also have the vocational programme, which has really good modules and practical things such as enterprise education and the world of work.  Yet, students have to do the LCVP in order to access those.  We also have the leaving certificate applied, which we feel is a strong programme and a very successful programme but it sometimes denies opportunities for students pursuing that programme to do other things in leaving certificate established.  There are also issues about progression around LCA as well.  It is about finding ways through which it would be more student-centred so that students would be able to find ways to get access to things and that we do not have barriers put up necessarily to the sort of experiences that they can get access to.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tattan.  It is true that we need a student-centred experience.  As Mr. Tattan said, it is about spreading the assessment load throughout the year or over two years.  I would be interested in continuous assessment and, from a teaching point of view, how teaching staff are involved in that assessment going forward.  It is important teachers have the skills to be able to take on that work.  We heard from previous contributors to the committee about surveys undertaken in respect of which there were approximately 2,000 respondents and which showed that up to one third of teachers felt that for the students involved their contribution and assessment was really important.  If any of the witnesses would like to comment on that, I would appreciate it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tattan spoke about the different types of leaving certificates.  When looking at reform of the leaving certificate and bringing in more practical aspects to the course load, the workload, the orals and so on we might, perhaps, look at developing the student's practical side as well as the theory and academic side, given we are considering listing the apprenticeships and further and higher education courses on the CAO form and promoting other forms or pathways of obtaining a qualification.<\/p><p>Perhaps somebody involved in policy or the curriculum might wish to speak to that.

We currently completely rely on external assessment with events.  Somebody goes in to sit an examination or for an oral or practical examination.  More continuous assessment would almost necessarily involve school-based involvement at some level, with teachers potentially being more involved in assessing students in some way.  Other systems have that approach.  There is a high level of trust in the leaving certificate and its reliability, since it is external, anonymous and so on.  It is not that we should not be thinking about this.  We should be thinking about it, but there are implications to it and other systems are prepared to go down routes like this, potentially with external moderation to ensure fairness.  It would be a marked change of approach to the current approach.  We would have to think carefully about how we would properly support teachers to do that in a way that would work for them and for students.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about encouraging the practical side of things.  Going back to the experience of secondary education in Ireland, we want, as far as we can, to properly equip students for the next stage of their lives, whether that is higher education, further education and training, apprenticeships, work, or whatever they choose to do.  They should be properly prepared for that.  When one looks at how the leaving certificate is currently constructed and the examination can dominate the experience of the last year or two of school, we have to question whether we are doing that correctly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for joining us.

I am sure the witnesses have been following them.  They have been very thought-provoking and there have been a lot of very interesting contributions.  I agree with the points made by previous speakers about apprenticeships.  We need to give those a very significant lift, increase the number of people going into apprenticeships and increase the prestige.  Obviously some of that work lies with the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, but there is a role for the Department of Education as well.  The other major themes relate to continuous assessment and spreading the pressure of the terminal exam across a greater period.  For example, under the system in Britain and in the North, students build their grades continuously over the course of three years between their GCSEs, AS levels and A levels.  Is the Department open-minded about the idea of the leaving certificate qualification being accumulated over the course of the two years of the cycle in the form of accredited grades, fifth year exams or certain components being undertaken within fifth year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#S00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>It is an interesting point.  We should be open to considering any of these possibilities.  The sort of scenario the Deputy has painted is one that would certainly have the potential to help students in alleviating some of the stress.  However, a couple of things strike me that mean we have to think carefully about it.  One issue is that a very modularised experience might not be as positive for students.  For example, we could decide that the oral examinations should happen at the end of fifth year.  Nobody would think that a good idea because a major part of the experience of pursuing a language subject could potentially fall away at a very early stage.  That does not mean there are not some aspects we could do earlier in the two-year cycle and that could potentially include things in fifth year if we thought that was appropriate.  An argument is often made, quite rightly, that spreading these assessment events out ought to reduce the stress levels but there is a risk if there are a lot of them, or if we start to introduce lots of different assessment components across the range of subjects, that students could be hitting assessment events on a regular basis.  That could impact on what is happening in the classroom as they would not be able to see beyond the next practical, the next project or whatever it might be.  We have to be careful and structure things in such a way that they do not have unintended consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>There is a balance to be struck there.  Related to this is that continuous assessment comes up a lot.  Teachers and school staff raise a legitimate concern about this, which is worthy of consideration.  In the Irish education system, the teacher and school staff occupy the role of an advocate for the student.  It is a different dynamic to further and higher education in that, until this emergency pandemic situation, those teachers never had a role in any kind of State certification of qualifications in that way.  There is a legitimate fear that continuous assessment could affect the relationship that exists between students and teachers.<\/p><p>Has there been any examination of forms of continuous assessment that are marked externally in other jurisdictions?

There is also an international dimension to the reflection there has been in the past two years so we can truly understand the various opportunities that might be available to us.  Equally, the relationship the Deputy mentioned between teachers and students was a feature of the contributions from teacher and school representatives at the meeting of the advisory group last week.

A lot of concerns have been raised on the T1 and T2 Irish language proposals.  It seems quite apparent that there is a problem in creating a subject that carries equal weighting and is more challenging without providing any real incentive.  On a theoretical basis I have no objection to having a more challenging course for native speakers and advanced learners of Irish but if there is no obvious incentive for schools to take it up I am not sure they will do so.  There are options.  It could be an additional subject in the same way that applied mathematics is or there could be bonus points but if there is no incentive I do not see why a school, even in Conamara or Corca Dhuibhne, would take it up.  A lot of schools and parents would be reluctant if students have a better chance of achieving full marks in the other subject.  There is a bit of a problem there so I ask the witnesses to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  As I have this opportunity I will make the following point to the officials from the Department.  Sometimes when we talk about the leaving certificate, we talk about the inequalities that exist but we all know that educational disadvantage in schools starts at a young age.  It will not all be resolved by addressing the leaving certificate or access to third level education.

The NCCA got 740 responses to a survey it undertook as part of the consultation.  It got 240 witness submissions.  It had 13 focus group meetings with 275 individuals, as well as eight bilateral meetings and 19 one-to-one engagements.

I have two quick questions.<\/p> <p>  The Department's statement on new and revised curricular specifications includes clear statements on digital learning skills and the use of digital technologies.  It was mentioned in the debate in the Seanad last week.  I would like to ask the officials if there are any plans to develop a national online learning programme, as recommended by this committee on the work that was done and on the report that was carried out and published on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary education.  At the time, SOLAS stated to the committee that it would be happy to assist the Department of Education in developing such a programme, similar to the one that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has in place.  Has the Department been in contact with SOLAS in this regard?  If not, do the officials see any merit in liaising with SOLAS officials to ascertain how this can be done?  We have to learn lessons post Covid-19.  It is great that the Government will have a separate report on Covid-19 and I have no doubt but that it will take health, education and living into account.  However, this is just one part that we need to address.  We need to see what the officials have to say on that.<\/p> <p>  As well as this, the Library Association of Ireland has recently corresponded with the committee regarding the need to increase the number of school libraries.  This was a recommendation and I am nearly sure that it was in the programme for Government.  I strongly believe in encouraging young children, both in primary and in post primary, to read.  A love for books is fundamentally important.  This is especially because, I think we can all agree, young children are now on technological devices.  If they were allowed to stay on them, they would be on them morning, noon and night.  I am a father of an 11-year-old, a ten-year-old and seven-year-old.  I have no doubt every parent will agree with me and can put themselves in my shoes.  I will not say the word \"rows\" because I do not want to be too dramatic, but it is continuously a fight to get young people off devices nowadays.<\/p><p>We need to give them the opportunity to read books, bring books home from school, exchange books and things like that.  It is difficult for some families to go to the public library, but if the library is in the school, it gives them an opportunity to exchange books and bring books home.<\/p><p> Particularly during the pandemic, we have seen the effect that technology devices have on young children and families as a whole.  There were no sporting activities and no school or anything else, so the only way to communicate was through devices.

That would include options such as apprenticeships and going on to further and higher education.  As Mr. Tattan said, we work closely with colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We recently established a national policy group to put in place a guidance strategy, a continuum, a whole-of-guidance strategy right across the system, including to the areas of further and higher education and the world of work.

I am sorry I was delayed.  I was at another meeting but I have listened to a good bit of the debate.  Many of these questions have probably been asked so I will be brief.<\/p> <p>  Something I take from my time teaching is that I always tried to examine what the students knew rather than what they did not know.  That was the principle that I always tried to take into my own assessment when I was teaching.  I suppose the big thing that has worked in the students' favour this year and last year, in terms of leaving certificate 2021 and 2022, is that they have an expanded range of questions and choice in those formal examinations.  Can Mr. Tatton comment if that is what is envisaged to continue in the short term, irrespective of the bigger question of leaving certificate reform?  I refer to 2023 and, perhaps, 2024.  Is that type of expanded line of questioning and choice and range set to continue into the future?

Sometimes there may be further questions added to the paper to give more choice.  Sometimes there is less required of a student in terms of content to be covered in order to be able to access the paper.<\/p> <p>  Over the past couple of years those have been responses to Covid and the disruption students have experienced as a result of Covid.  Obviously, there was quite a bit of positive feedback and I seem to remember, in terms of the examination, particularly the written examination last June, some of the pressures students would have experienced in trying to get through a paper in a demanding three hours or thereabouts timeframe seemed to have been lifted somewhat.  That is interesting.  It is something we need to reflect on in terms of whether that is an improved experience but I suppose, too, going back some of the earlier conversation, whatever assessment process we have now and into the future needs to be properly aligned to the curriculum and it needs to be a fair assessment in terms of the students' skills and knowledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tattan for that.  I have just one question and a comment as well.  Following on from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in relation to reports about what is happening with the Irish language, I spent most of my career teaching Irish and I suppose I would like to think that I know the challenges in terms of what is ahead for the language.  Mr. Tattan will not probably respond ahead of the report that the Department will issue but I suppose I would like to put it on the record that I believe that any suggestion of abolishing foundation level Irish would be a mistake.  It is a level at which certain children can be reached out to and, in terms of embracing the language, any suggestion that that would be abolished would be a mistake.  I hope that that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  I reinforce what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said in relation to providing an incentive for people to take higher level Irish.  For a long time in my teaching career, it was always a challenge to try to get children to continue taking higher level but the more children we can induce to take higher level Irish the better it is for the health and well-being of the language in the long term.  With mathematics and applied mathematics, we supplied inducements through bonus points.  That is something that needs to be considered for Irish.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on digital technologies.  It was referenced earlier that in the region of &euro;200 million was suppled during the pandemic to get schools up and running in  terms of information technology, IT.  Is that the level of investment we are likely to see continuing post-Covid given that is the general direction and tread in the teaching methodologies that are used by teachers and the access that students now would have at home as well to today's devices?  It is ironic that I am asking this question just after the Chair asked how do we get our children off devices but in terms of learning and the positive benefits that they can supply, is that level of investment likely to continue into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#X00300","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>On that, that struck me too.  I suppose like everything there are pluses and minuses to these things.  However, we know that for children, no more than with ourselves, their lives are so informed and so imbedded in digital, and it will be part of their lives.  We need to ensure that we are preparing them and, I suppose, ensuring too that there are balanced plans and that there are other experiences in life beyond that.<\/p><p>The level of investment is really important.  Obviously, it has been particularly important to support the remote learning that has been necessary.  We know that is not as good as the face-to-face experiences when students are physically in schools each day, but it was key in maintaining connection with students during that time.  In the context of the review of the senior cycle, the likelihood is that, as we have done to date and are likely to be doing, we will continue to devise new forms of assessment, some of which are going to be technology-based.  That is something that some subjects particularly lend themselves to.  It is going to be important that the structures are there and available to schools so that they can access them in a meaningful way in order that students can take up courses, excel and enjoy them.<\/p><p> On the question about Irish, I note the point the Deputy made about the foundation level and encouraging the use of the language for those in the higher achieving space.  From our perspective, we want students to continue to be able to engage with the national language at whatever level they wish and are able to do.  We will have to reflect on the work of the NCCA on level 1 and level 2.  That will be helpful in informing the approaches we will take, going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#X00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I have a number of short questions arising from the discussion.  In terms of the guidance counsellors, I know our guests mentioned there will be a strategy there and that there are 900 guidance councillors already.  However, it is quite obvious that number is not sufficient.  We need more boots on the ground, particularly for exploring options for students around further and higher education.  That must match up with the apprenticeship opportunities that hopefully will be provided.   How many extra guidance counsellors would the Department anticipate being in place in the next couple of years?  I know our guests will agree that it is impossible for one guidance counsellor to spread himself or herself so thinly around a school of a couple of hundred students.  Such a counsellor is unable to give the type of guidance that is necessary.<\/p> <p>  Computer science is now available in schools, as was mentioned.  Has the Department a measure of exactly how many second level schools computer science is available in and where those schools are?  We must ensure we are not creating an unequal playing field for those who want to pursue the subject.  We all agree that digitalisation and digital technologies are the way forward.  We need opportunities for students there.  In how many schools is computer science available and where are those schools?<\/p> <p>  What formal communications does the Department have with those who are delivering the national broadband plan and how often are those meetings and engagements?

In terms of further posts, beyond what we currently have, that is something that would have to be considered in the context of any discussions on priorities.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Moran may have some statistics on the Deputy's question about computer science.

That has been talked about in the public domain for some time, particularly with the leaving certificate more than just the senior cycle more generally.  I concur with the view that minds have been concentrated in recent years.  The issue has been around for a while but it has reached the point where we need to look closely at it.  Compared with systems in other jurisdictions, many positives have come out of the past few years in terms of the willingness of teachers to step up to the plate and in their public service commitment and collaboration to do things that were untested before.  I mention the voice of students as well.  The level of resilience in our system was exposed.  Other countries that relied more heavily on continuous assessment, project work, school-based assessment and so on were better placed to pivot and cope than Ireland was because we rely a lot on an external assessment and a terminal exam.

It has since been available for roll-out nationally.  We work closely with schools proposing to offer the subject, given that it is brand new.  Our teacher support and professional development services provide extensive CPD to teachers in those schools to ensure the subject is rolled out effectively.

Some of their inputs have been positive.  There has been some criticism of the Department in the past for being overly conservative and I have not seen that today.  We have a lengthy report coming out and we have done a huge amount of work.  I would like to understand from the witnesses what interactions they have had with the academic community.  I would also like to discuss some of the policy decisions, particularly from the NCCA because we have heard some interesting testimony from some academics during the course of compiling this report.<\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships have been mentioned and it is fair to say that the future is a green one.  We are probably not seeing the amount of education that we need at the moment.  There has been significant investment in third level education but that is very recent and one of the difficulties is how we ensure that younger students in second and even first level education would go into the kind of areas where the future is likely to be.  I would like to think that if we concentrated more on mentorships and transforming the school system so that it appears more like transition year throughout school, that could have an influence on what people choose to do because they would have some experience.<\/p><p>However, now we have quite an academic model of education, which is leading people in a different direction.  <\/p><p> The Department has shown it would consider remodelling assessment.  That was a positive evident in the previous contribution, particularly in light of the flexibility shown in other jurisdictions during the pandemic, which shows the importance of such flexibility.  The conversation on a hybrid model leaving certificate is probably about having such flexibility.  What may be needed is not so much a hybrid model as having continuous assessment.  Currently, students are very much under pressure.  While it is important to consider a hybrid model for this year, we need to consider a continuous assessment model into the future.<\/p><p> The pandemic has had an influence on the way people view caring work in society.  I would reference the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  If we were to carry out a similar exercise, people would have a very different approach to education following the pandemic than they had prior to it.  We are at a crucial point now.  I have spoken for way too long and note the time I have taken.  I would welcome any thoughts the witnesses would have on those comments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#Z00300","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments and questions.  Mr. Moran may also wish to comment further on the Senator's points.  In terms of the NCCA process, we have had engagement with the NCCA since it submitted the report.  It had provided us with a briefing.  It has worked in very well both international and national research on the views, experience and knowledge of academic ideas, which is very much reflected in the work it has done.<\/p> <p>  On apprenticeships and the academic system we have, we are very mindful efforts have been made to raise the profile and prestige around apprenticeships in recent times.  One factor in the context of senior cycle review, which is perhaps beyond senior cycle in a sense, is about pathways, which is about preparing students for what they want to do in the next stage of their lives.  Pathways in the past may have been more linear in terms of a pathway to college or going to work but now individuals may move in many different directions.  We need to ensure we are student-centred and that there are opportunities to move.  It may be that people want to move into work, training, apprenticeship or change careers and so on.  That level of flexibility and mobility is important to us.<\/p> <p>  Transition year could provide good opportunities.  Certainly there are many good examples of transition year programmes that have worked really well and that have had very good links with employers, higher education, further education and so on.  We would like to raise that to the point where there is greater evenness in the spread of experience students get during transition year.<\/p> <p>  On the hybrid model versus continuous assessment, there is an interesting point around that.  What we might say about the system of accredited grades is that it was a response to a particular emergency situation, but it should not be mistaken for an answer to some of the challenges around the leaving certificate or senior cycle and, potentially, continuous assessment or different forms of assessment may offer us more opportunities.  On the pressure point aspect, there may be an inevitability and some degree of pressure in addressing what is a significant moment in the lives of students and it may be unavoidable.  However, very high levels of stress are unacceptable and where the experience is dominated by an exam rather than what is happening in school each day in their learning environment, we have to question the process.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator's final point on the impact of the pandemic in terms of implications for gender and other issues in society is an interesting one and something we need to be cognisant of in the context of implementation.

They emphasised that there would be a benefit from decoupling the leaving certificate from the admissions institutions that we have in Ireland at present.  Obviously, if people described the primary purpose of the leaving certificate then, unfortunately, I think that many of them would say that it determines what a person does at third level as opposed to the culmination of all the work that he or she has done at second level.  Does Mr. Tattan think there is any benefit in trying to decouple the leaving certificate from admissions to third level?  Obviously, we would save the third level institutions a huge amount of trouble by deciding admissions on the basis of the leaving certificate results.  Is Mr. Tattan concerned that if we decoupled it too much, we may find ourselves in an unfair situation, as can happen in other countries, whereby there would be a system of admission to third level that would be difficult to identify?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#BB00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>There probably are, and I think the Deputy has touched on some of the arguments.  There are arguments both ways on this one.  On the one hand, there is a huge convenience in having a simple set of exams, which is a route through to things like higher education if that is where one wants to be.  The leaving certificate is obviously not that and should not be viewed as that.  I am not saying that the Deputy is saying that though for many it is, in effect, a passport to higher education.  Often that is where the pressure is created.  Much of the commentary is about the pressure, particularly in the context of high-demand courses and that back flows into the leaving certificate and, therefore, the senior cycle experience too.  At one level, one might say if we were to decouple this would that be a way to ease that sort of pressure.  However, I would not be too sure of that for a couple of reasons.  One is that, presumably, if it were not there, something else would have to replace it in terms of higher education admissions.  Although this means that that would then become where the pressure point is.  That situation could be worse for students in many ways because unless we were to ditch the leaving certificate, they would have a leaving certificate but it might be far less regarded than it currently is whereby it might just be seen as something that has to be gone through.  Really, however, the focus, if a person wants to go on into higher education, is whatever the process is there.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, some countries, especially the US, are questioning quite significantly their current admissions systems.  So things like the standard assessment tests, SATs, which were regarded as tried and tested methods of admission in the US, are now being questioned much more seriously.<\/p> <p>  Potentially, there is something there.  I think, perhaps, through keeping the integration there.  Is there a way for us to make it more holistic?  Should the final assessment someone gets at the end of the senior cycle experience be as narrow as a set of grades in a set of subject or could we make it broader than that?  Maybe things like transition year might offer opportunities around that, which might help to broaden it out and that it would be more than simply a set of marks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":196,"content":"<p>This is a complicated issue.

They often work in the most challenging and difficult of circumstances in areas of conflict and war.  With us are Ms Isabel Simpson, executive director of MSF Ireland, Ms Sarah Leahy, returned project co-ordinator of MSF Helmand province, Afghanistan, Ms Frauke Ossig, emergency co-ordinator, MSF Lithuania and Poland, and Mr. D&oacute;nal Gorman, communications manager of MSF Ireland.  They are all most welcome.  I thank them for agreeing to brief the committee on their important work in an ever-changing environment of challenge and conflict.  I suggest that the format of the meeting will involve us hearing the witnesses' opening statements, following by a discussion and questions and answers from members.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow all members the opportunity to participate.  Hopefully, we will have a second round and an opportunity for members to come back in should they so desire, if time permits.<\/p> <p>  I have a note on privilege for our witnesses.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and needless to say, they shall comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present do.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against any person outside the House or any official, either by name or in a way that makes that person identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Simpson to make her opening statement and to introduce her colleagues.  I thank the witnesses for being with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#A00400","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.  Good afternoon to the Chair, Senators, Deputies, ladies and gentlemen.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Doctors Without Borders, would like to sincerely thank the committee for giving us this opportunity to present to it some critical humanitarian crises that we are responding to.  In doing so, we will highlight urgent humanitarian concerns that MSF is encountering through its work.<\/p><p> Last year was a major milestone in MSF&rsquo;s history as we reached our 50th anniversary.  However, in many ways, we felt there is little to celebrate as the global needs in humanitarian medical action have only increased during this time.  Major conflicts rage in Syria, Yemen and the Tigray region of Ethiopia.  Globally, there are increased numbers of refugees and displaced and vulnerable populations, an increasing impact of climate change on communities in the global South, and increasing attacks on healthcare facilities and workers in conflict-affected settings where MSF is present.  In South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, recurring outbreaks of preventable diseases such as malaria and cholera continue to cause high levels of mortality.  In addition, we have all been battling the global Covid pandemic for more than two years.  The new inequalities that it has created in access to vaccines, treatments and other medical technologies are a stark reality in MSF's work around the world.  It is an issue this committee has looked at before and which we would like to see remain on its agenda.<\/p><p> This afternoon, we would like to update the committee on two key contexts that are high in our priorities at present.  The first is Afghanistan, where MSF has worked for more than three decades and where protracted conflict has given way to a crisis involving a healthcare system which is entirely dependent on aid.  With a population now experiencing food insecurity, increasingly high levels of acute malnutrition are being reported from our medical facilities on the ground.<\/p><p> Second, the movement of people from one place to another has always occurred but, since 2015, MSF has borne witness to and assisted people affected by an acute humanitarian crisis, worsened by inhumane migration policies at Europe&rsquo;s borders and elsewhere.  Whatever the drivers of migration may be - whether it is war, conflict, persecution, climate change or economics &ndash; migrants deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity.  We last addressed our work on migration to this committee in 2018 and, regrettably, not much has changed since then.  MSF still operates a search and rescue ship in the central Mediterranean, where many lives are being lost as people make the treacherous crossing to try to reach European shores.  We know many people are being returned by the Libyan coast guard to places of detention in Libya that are overcrowded and rife with disease, and where they suffer further violence and abuse.  In the camps on the Greek islands, our teams continue to provide care to migrants and asylum seekers as their health and mental health deteriorates from years of living in limbo.  We see the desperation of these people, we treat the injuries they have received during their journeys or related to the conditions they are held in, and we continue to speak out.<\/p><p> Since last August, we have witnessed a new crisis emerging on the border between Belarus, Lithuania and Poland.  We will hear from a colleague from the MSF team that is providing assistance to migrants at border areas but where access to deliver medical care and humanitarian aid remains hampered.  The EU member states involved have failed to live up to their responsibilities to protect people&rsquo;s lives, to uphold basic rights of people seeking protection and to permit humanitarian assistance to reach vulnerable people, regardless of whether they are in a small boat crossing the Mediterranean or hiding in a snow-clad forest in Lithuania.<\/p><p> On behalf of MSF teams providing impartial, independent medical assistance on the front lines of humanitarian crises around the world , we thank the committee for inviting us today.  We will start our highlighting of a few key contexts by crossing to Sarah Leahy, recently returned project co-ordinator for MSF in Helmand province, Afghanistan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I am a project co-ordinator with MSF.  I worked in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province, from January until September 2021.  I was on the ground working with our team of more than 1,000 staff before, during and after the transition from the then Government of Afghanistan to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  I witnessed first-hand the challenges encountered by the Afghan people during the conflict and in the immediate post-conflict phase.<br\/><br\/>Since the change in power, MSF has continued to provide life-saving medical care to people in dire need across the country.  In five locations across Afghanistan, our medical teams are treating emergency trauma cases, supporting people with chronic conditions and welcoming new life to the world in uncertain times.  MSF is working in Lashkar Gah and Kandahar, both in the south, Herat in the west and Kunduz in the north.  MSF also runs a maternity hospital in Khost in the east of the country.  Hospitals and medical facilities across the country are under extreme pressure, with staff and equipment shortages due to a severe lack of funding.  At Boost hospital, we now have more than 1,300 staff and it is one of MSF&rsquo;s largest projects in the world.  The hospital now has at least 700 patients arriving every day - sometimes it is 900 - most of them children.<br\/><br\/>Levels of severe acute malnutrition have risen in MSF-supported facilities in recent months.  An average of 400 children per month are being treated for severe acute malnutrition in Boost hospital.  In the feeding centre, our team is working day and night to treat the direct medical complications of malnutrition, as well as constantly preparing therapeutic foods to feed every child three times a day.  Every one of these young patients is under five years old.  Many of them are also suffering from worrying complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea or gastrointestinal problems.  I saw the increase in children suffering from severe acute malnutrition with my own eyes in Helmand province last year.  This is likely due to persistent drought, food scarcity, an improved security situation, an economic crisis and a health system in a state of disarray.  As the only fully functional public hospital in the province, Boost hospital in Lashkar Gah is very busy.  Other public health facilities both within Lashkar Gah city and in nearby rural provinces continue to struggle to deliver services.  An average of 60 babies per day are delivered in the maternity department.  Some 100 babies were born in a single day in September, the highest number the hospital had ever seen, and in November, 1,900 deliveries were completed for a third consecutive month.  These are babies and mothers who, without the services of MSF, would not have access to free maternity care.<br\/><br\/>Seeing the crisis through the eyes of our national staff colleagues from Afghanistan is very insightful.  One of my colleagues, Mohammed, a doctor who has worked at Boost hospital since 2010, noted:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe are seeing double the usual numbers of patients in the feeding centre recently.  Our main concern now is that we&rsquo;re running out of beds.  At the moment, it&rsquo;s two families - one mother and one child - to every hospital bed.  We work hard to be flexible, but we can only admit the sickest.  This means triaging patients is really important, and we make sure that those we can&rsquo;t admit are seen elsewhere in the hospital.  Despite this, it is calm inside the feeding centre.  Although many mothers are anxious, they are happy that they are here and that their children are receiving high quality medical care. <\/blockquote><p>Mohammed also told me how the healthcare system has all but collapsed in Helmand, and people are now travelling from very far districts in the north of the province to reach MSF.  These are journeys that can take well over three hours, which is a long distance when a child is very sick.  The people who reach MSF are the lucky ones.  Many of them arrive on foot.<br\/><br\/>Mohammed told me of a family who came from a town called Musa Qala, which was under Taliban control as far back as 2020, and from where only a few patients have ever reached us.  Their story helps explain the crisis.  Mohammed said:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe family were very poor and struggled to find food while the young mother was pregnant.  This is the same for many families now &ndash; there are no jobs and everything in the market is very expensive.  People also have very limited access to information on health, so when their child is severely sick, they sometimes do not know what to do or where to go.  When the baby was born, the young mother became very weak and could not breastfeed her child.  The little girl was malnourished from the very first day of her life.  Although we treat many patients for approximately three weeks, this little girl has now been with us in the feeding centre for three months.  She is still weak, but we hope she will improve with our care. <\/blockquote><p>For years, the healthcare system in Afghanistan has been underfunded, understaffed and under-equipped and is reliant on foreign donors.  One of the greatest risks for the health system now is the risk of total collapse due to a lack of international support.  The ripple effect of sanctions and other measures placed on Afghanistan's new government is being felt deeply nationwide.  The country faces near economic and institutional collapse, including an inability to provide the most basic services and pay civil servant salaries.  The banking sector is paralysed, which prevents people from accessing their life savings and complicates even the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  High rates of inflation are further increasing the strain on the majority of Afghans, who routinely struggle just to survive.  The United Nations stated in November 2021 that nearly 23 million people, or 55% of the Afghan population, are estimated to be in crisis or experiencing emergency levels of food insecurity.<br\/><br\/>Policymakers and donors must prove that they are committed to preserving or improving the welfare of the Afghan people by ensuring that punitive measures taken against the Taliban regime and its members do not make an extreme humanitarian and socioeconomic situation much worse and potentially irreversible.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee.  I will pass to my colleague, Ms Frauke Ossig, emergency co-ordinator with MSF.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leahy and welcome Ms Ossig.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#C00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its interest in our programmes.  It is very much appreciated.<br\/><br\/>I will speak about the most recent programme I was involved in, from last year until the beginning of this year.  I have been working in the last year in three different migration contexts.  My year started with a refugee project we had in Sudan for the people who had to flee from the Tigray region in Ethiopia.  I then moved on and spent time in our Mediterranean mission where we have, as Ms Simpson mentioned, the <i>MV Geo Barents<\/i>, in the Mediterranean Sea to save lives at sea.  I spent the past two months in Poland and Lithuania for our response to the humanitarian crisis.  We see it as a humanitarian crisis, and not, as the media likes to title it, a migration crisis, in the area of Belarus bordering Poland and Lithuania.<br\/><br\/>We had a team arrive in Lithuania in September last year.  In October, we had an emergency team arrive in Poland.  In October, we sent additional teams into Belarus, where we have a stable project which has already been working for a couple of years and is concentrating on tuberculosis.  Our intention, as with most of the projects, was to reach out to the people most in need of humanitarian assistance.  From our perspective, this was very clearly the population that is caught between border guards on the Belarusian side and the European border guards on the Polish and Lithuanian side.<br\/><br\/>What is happening is that the people who cross into Poland and Lithuania are either directly pushed back and blocked from entering Poland or Lithuania or, once they have entered, they are taken by the border guards to the border posts where, on the Polish side, for example, they are issued a letter to leave Poland without any possibility of applying for international protection or asylum.  With this letter, they are then put back in the vehicles of the European border guards - in this case, Polish border guards - driven back to the border and pushed back across the border fence, a razor-wire fence that has been erected in both countries.  This is happening on both sides.<br\/><br\/>A few people who manage, under unclear and arbitrary criteria, to hand in a request for asylum in Poland or Lithuania are then automatically detained.  Both the push-backs and the detention are based on changes in the national legislation that Lithuania and Poland have been putting in place, successively.  They first put in place a state of emergency and have made changes in national legislation since July.  In the beginning, they used Covid very much as a justification to prevent people from applying for asylum.  Later, however, a state of emergency was established in both countries.<br\/><br\/>In 2021, we saw more than 35,000 push-backs in Poland.  That does not mean 35,000 people because we also know that many people have tried more than once to enter Poland and, in a kind of ping-pong process, they have been pushed back by border guards on both sides.  After the push-back to Belarus, they have not been able to return to Minsk where they originally came from as they have been blocked by Belarusian border guards and pushed across the border again into Poland or Lithuania.  We have seen more than 8,000 push-backs in Lithuania.  By the way, in 2021, we also saw more than 30,000 push-backs in the Mediterranean Sea.<br\/><br\/>What is happening is that these people are remaining in the forest area between the border guards, out of fear of being pushed back into the violence they have experienced on all three countries' sides of the border.  The border guards in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus are reportedly using violence against the migrants, the people on the move, during the push-backs.  While we have seen it more on the Polish and Lithuanian sides in July, August and September, since October-November we have been seeing an increase in the violence the Belarusian border guards are using, leading people in the forest to be afraid to come out and call for help because they will not have access to unconditional humanitarian assistance.<br\/><br\/>The border areas are cut off by the state of emergency.  Humanitarian organisations are not allowed to enter.  People remain in the forest in below-zero temperatures, without food and access to water and medical care because they know they will not get unconditional access or any right to apply for asylum or international protection when they report to the border guards.  This has been our struggle, which is one of the reasons we had to take the decision to withdraw our team from Poland.  The majority of the people, or the people in most need who are caught between the border guards, were not reachable for us.<br\/><br\/>From our perspective, this is another example of very reckless European border policies that are working with deterrence and disrespecting and violating people's rights while on the move.  People must have a clear legal way to request international protection.  They must have access to asylum procedures.  They must have access to legal assistance, which is not the case even after they have handed in their application for asylum.  As such, they will not have access to a lawyer and the legal assistance that should, by law, be provided to them.<\/p><p>The European Union has been quiet on the limitations of access, although this is happening on European borders and European border guards are driving people back, including sick children, into the forest in snow and freezing conditions.<\/p><p> Finally, the European Commission in December proposed an interim measures catalogue, which we assume is going to be voted on at the beginning of March.  From our perspective, it is a dangerous precedent for migration policy in Europe.  It will take away rights from people on the move and will no longer guarantee the most vulnerable have access to protection.  It will keep people in conditions that are absolutely unacceptable, with lengthy detentions, and will legitimise violations of European asylum law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ossig, Ms Simpson and Ms Leahy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>We are happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank our wonderful guests.  It has been an eye-opening experience to hear directly from representatives of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  I am sure they can appreciate that, in our role as a foreign affairs and defence committee, we receive much correspondence from many different areas.  Even so, I must be honest and say that nothing has struck me as much as a sentence in the documentation our guests provided, namely, &ldquo;The little girl was malnourished from the very first day of her life.&rdquo; That really struck me.<\/p> <p>  My first questions are for Ms Simpson.  This is the 50th anniversary of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  That is an achievement in itself and one which the organisation should celebrate where the opportunity presents itself.  She mentioned the increasing impact of climate change.  Perhaps she will give some us information on MSF&rsquo;s experience of climate change and the role it has played over the past 50 years.  What changes arising from climate change has the organisation seen?<\/p> <p>  Ms Simpson went on to mention Covid, and we all know the impact that has had throughout the world.  She referred to other medical technologies.  Will she elaborate on them?<\/p> <p>  Finally, will Ms Simpson give us a broader understanding of the role played by the search and rescue ship in the central Mediterranean Sea and the kind of work it undertakes?<\/p> <p>  Ms Leahy spoke about Boost hospital, its 1,300 staff and the 900 people, most of them children, who arrive every day.  Will she outline the capacity in that hospital and describe the facilities?  She spoke also of an area from which MSF sees very few people coming.  It may be slightly na&iuml;ve of me to ask, but is that because they have access to other medical care, or is it an area MSF considers of deep concern because so few people from that area come forward seeking medical attention?  There was a reference to 100 babies being born in a single day.  That is a major maternity hospital in and of itself, which is why I would like to know more about the capacity and the facilities at the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00400","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank our guests and congratulate them on the anniversary of the organisation they represent.  One of them used the term \"feeding centres\".  As a mother of two children in Ireland, that is not a word I come across when I bring them to a children's hospital.  Nutrition is something we take completely for granted in this country.  It hit home when our guests narrated the story of the doctor, Mohammed, saying the feeding centres were calm.  I had never heard the term before and it seems almost to be from another realm, given how difficult it is for us to comprehend.  It is upsetting that the organisation's main patients are children under the age of five.  As Deputy Clarke said, to think a child would suffer from malnutrition from birth is awful and very sad.<\/p> <p>  I again thank our guests for their work.  If there is anything we can do as a committee to support it, they might let us know.  I appreciate how important that work is, not just in Afghanistan, Belarus and the other places they mentioned but throughout the world where M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has or has had projects.

I stand in awe, as I am sure all my colleagues do, of the great work they do.  It is extraordinary and quite wonderful, and anybody remotely civilised would want to support them in every way.<\/p> <p>  Forgive my ignorance; I should know this but I do not.  Does MSF get any state funding from the various member states, and if so, is it adequate?  Is it funded from Ireland?  If not, is it a deliberate exercise on the organisation's part to keep away from state funding?  If there is any way we could assist in that regard as a committee, we will try.<\/p> <p>  I have been watching, as I am sure virtually all colleagues have, television programmes and bits of news pieces on Afghanistan, where it seems society is breaking down in many ways and there is significant malnutrition, suffering and disintegration.  I acknowledge MSF is not a political organisation but rather is voluntary and exists to deal with the symptoms rather than the politics.  Nevertheless, in our guests' practical experience, do they believe the sanctions on the country should cease?  What do they think of the idea of linking sanctions to the achieving of human rights there?  I saw a report recently - I cannot recall where - that suggested the Taliban was going back to form and reversing in respect of its attitude to women, and there were a few bad episodes in that regard.  I am interested to hear our guests' comments on that.  Do they see any evolution from the earlier Taliban?  It presented an attempt at good PR in the beginning, but I wonder what the reality is.  Either way, it is a society that has broken down and I salute MSF's work there.<\/p> <p>  On Belarus, it seems the poor migrants on the borders are being treated as footballs or chess pieces in the game of geopolitics.<\/p><p>It is just shocking.  The witnesses might forgive me as I had an interruption while Belarus was being spoken about.  Are many of the migrants making it to Poland and being treated properly there or are they just being put backwards and forwards in a wrong kind of way?  Maybe MSF will elaborate a little on that.<\/p><p> My final question relates to Covid and all the migrants and other people MSF deals with.  I assume Covid is a major issue and that there are questions as regards vaccination.  I would be interested in the witnesses' comments on that.  I am sure they would be of the view we need to vaccinate everybody in order for everybody to be safe but I include all criteria.  MSF might comment on that.

As some colleagues have stated, we are all a bit in awe of what the organisation does.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, the world is in a very precarious place.  MSF works in many countries across the globe, including Bangladesh, with the Rohingya, the Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Niger and so on.  The organisation also works in some countries that have taken in an awful lot of asylum seekers and refugees and it looks after those people.  MSF volunteers work in some of the most dangerous places in the world and put themselves at serious risk.  I ask that the witnesses comment on that risk.  Have any MSF volunteers been injured, assaulted, unlawfully detained and so forth?  Obviously, because they are working in parts of the word where disease is rampant, they are also at possible risk from illness and disease themselves.  In addition, it strikes me that if somebody goes to work in some of these situations that are very difficult - and extraordinarily so, to the extent that I am lost for words - the actual stress, strain, pressure and psychological impact on MSF volunteers must be enormous given what they are dealing with every day.  There is perhaps the feeling of helplessness that some of us might feel as well when we hear what the witnesses say.  What can we do?<\/p> <p>  MSF does not take any funds from the European Union.  It did in the past but no longer does since the EU's agreement with Turkey.  The witnesses might comment on that matter as well.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that democracy is in retreat globally.  There are an awful lot of regimes across the world.  I am aware MSF goes into all situations completely neutral and looks after all sides in a conflict provided that they leave their weapons at the door, which is good.  It cannot be easy, however.  When one looks at all the countries in the world where there is conflict and literally hell on earth, one can see that we are totally cocooned in this country.  Our problems are first-world problems compared with what the witnesses have described.  It must be absolutely shocking.  The question is what can be done.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses tell me how many people from Ireland are working abroad in other jurisdictions?  How many Irish volunteers does MSF have?  I know one or two people who are working and the impact on them has been enormous.  They will never be the same again having seen what they have seen and been through what they have been through.

I lost the connection a little bit during the final questions but between us we will manage to answer.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the question around climate change and how we see that affecting out programmes.  We have expertise in many things at MSF but climate change is one that is still as steep learning curve for us and I do not profess to have all the answers for that.  I might use some of our programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa as an example, such as those in places like Mozambique and South Sudan.  We see climate change affecting the communities we work with there in many different ways.  That can be affecting people's harvests which leads to poor food security and malnutrition.  It can be a source of conflict over precious resources like water.  It can also be in changing disease patterns because obviously climate change affects different vectors like mosquitos with malaria.  Thus, we see different trends emerging in disease patterns and it leads us to look at things like vector control in different ways than before.  Off the top of my head, I do not have any figures or data to illustrate the changes in disease but we see it very much.  Of course, it can also be a driver of conflict as well.  Many of the countries we work in are prone to civil conflict in any event.  When there is an economic downturn and competition for resources like food and water, it very often leads to greater conflict within these societies.  Similarly, we see changes in other countries we are working in such as ones in Asia and the Middle East.  If members would like more information on that, I can consult colleagues and send it on as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I move to Covid and Covid technologies.  MSF, through our access to medicines campaign, has been doing much work lobby globally, but also within Ireland and with other civil society groups in Ireland, on the TRIPS waiver regarding how we can scale up global production of vaccines.  It does not just include vaccines but, as I said, also treatments and other technologies.  By other technologies we mean PCR and antigen tests, as well as basic things like how to produce reliable and adequate quantities of PPE when needed for epidemic outbreaks.  I do not want to be negative but while we may at this point have a feeling that the situation with Covid is improving, the future is still uncertain.<\/p><p>We still need to ensure that, globally and in many of the countries in which we work, authorities have access to adequate vaccine supplies and to antigen tests, diagnostics and sufficient protective wear during outbreaks.<br\/><br\/>I will talk a little about our role in search and rescue in the Mediterranean.  Ms Ossig might address that one too.  Our role is simply to save lives.  In the Mediterranean, we see overcrowded rubber dinghies that the majority of us involved in the meeting today would not even consider getting into in a swimming pool, let alone getting into one with 60 to 100 other people in order to cross the Mediterranean, particularly in view of unpredictable weather conditions and so on.  As we speak, our ship, the <i>Geo Barents<\/i>, has rescued 439 people over the past few days.  These people are still on board having being turned away from Malta twice.  They are now trying to find a safe port of disembarkation in Italy.  This is the situation that teams on the <i>Geo Barents<\/i>face every day.  The 439 people are from seven different rescue operations.  That will give the committee an idea of scale in the context of how many people are rescued during each operation.<br\/><br\/>We have at times been accused of being a pull factor and told that we are encouraging people to cross the Mediterranean because they think MSF will rescue them.  One cannot imagine the desperation of these people to put their wives and children in a rubber dinghy on the high seas because they think MSF will rescue them.  We are not the pull factor.  The push factor is the terrible conditions that they are fleeing from and the detention centres in Libya where many of them end up when they are rescued by the Libyan coast guard.  I will hand over to Ms Ossig, who may have something more to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Ms Simpson said much of what I would have said.  I will add one point from.  I did an interview for Irish media a while ago about the Mediterranean.  I said that we have a role there that should not be our role.  We should not be on the Mediterranean to save lives because that is the role of those states that border it and that have declared a search and rescue zone.  Since Italy and Malta are not fulfilling their role and are not getting sufficient support from the EU to save lives at sea, there is nothing left but for non-governmental organisations to save people's lives because people will leave Libya whenever they have a chance and regardless of whether there is someone on the sea to rescue them.  We have seen it with the thousands of people who have drowned in the Mediterranean.  They are people who are so desperate to put their families on boats that they do it independently, but it should be our role.  It should be the role of the European Union to provide the response that is coming from member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Leahy if she can take the questions about Boost hospital in Lashkar Gah.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Of course.  Deputy Sorca Clarke asked about the capacity and facilities at Boost hospital.  Maybe I can give a bit of an idea of what the hospital looks like.  As I said earlier, there are nearly 1,300 staff there and sometimes up to 900 patients.  When I was there, there were sometimes up to 1,000 patients in for emergencies.  It is a very large hospital.  It is a 300-bed facility but we often have two patients in a bed because we do not have the capacity to have one patient per bed.  It is important to note that if a woman comes to the hospital with a child, she must be accompanied by a male chaperone or family member because women cannot come to the hospital unaccompanied.  They often bring their children to the hospital.  This also puts significant pressure on the hospital.  We have to feed everybody in the hospital and the kitchen might have to provide more than 4,000 meals today.<\/p> <p>  Regarding facilities in the hospital, we have an emergency room where we treat all of our patients initially before admitting them.  We have a large paediatric department.  Within that, we have a therapeutic feeding centre, which serves patients who have acute and severe malnutrition.  Ideally, these patients, who are all under five years of age, should be assessed by MSF and sent to other facilities, but these other clinics have not been operational since May 2021, or even before then when the fighting in Helmand province got very bad.  MSF ends up treating all of these patients, sometimes for months at a time.  The pressure is unsustainable.  We do not have anywhere to refer patients to.<\/p> <p>  We have a large maternity unit.  As I mentioned, I saw 100 women deliver on a particular day.  It is important to note that most women in Afghanistan deliver their babies at home.  These are primarily women with complications who are delivering late.  They experience obstructed labour.  Many arrive in a poor state and have not had any antenatal care because facilities are not operating to support them.<\/p> <p>  We run an operating theatre which in the past was not focused on trauma but which in recent times has had to.  From 1 May until the end of July, we treated 482 war-wounded patients in our operating theatre, which is a huge number.  Most of those wounds were called by shells and bullets.  More than a quarter of these patients were under the age of one.  More than 100 patients were just a few months old and had trauma from the conflict.<\/p> <p>  We have wards for post-operative care, including general inpatient wards segregated for males and females and large isolation units for contagious diseases such as measles and tuberculosis in which we treat Covid patients too.  There are patients who have comorbidities, such as presenting with Covid and tuberculosis, and children under five who have Covid.  We have a separate labour room for women who are in labour and have Covid.<\/p> <p>  We treat Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, which equates to a lesser version of Ebola and which has a very high mortality rate.  We have an outpatient department, which deals with more minor illnesses.  We have mental health services, which are so severely neglected that we can only really touch the surface.  We treat patients who may just have lost family members, who are at the end of their lives or who are extremely traumatised post conflict, which most people are.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why patients could not get treatment in somewhere like Musa Qala.  There were no services there at all in the past because it was under Taliban control.  The population could not get in or out of this particular area.<\/p><p>They do not now have the resources to build any facilities there so they have to travel.  They trust MSF because everybody in Helmand province, and indeed most people in Afghanistan, have family members who have been treated by MSF in some capacity.  There is a deep trust there.  They also know that free healthcare will be provided and they will not be discriminated against, regardless of any ethnic issues.  They know they will get healthcare regardless.  We have been able to treat so many people, both members of the Taliban and those on the side of the Government of Afghanistan, because of our principles of independence, impartiality and neutrality.  That is why we are held in such regard in Afghanistan.<\/p><p> I will talk briefly about linking the sanctions to the achievement of human rights.  There are basic human rights.  For example, every individual has the right to live.  That means it is our collective responsibility to protect human rights and safeguard human life.  People need access to free healthcare to all.  Everyone has the right to equal treatment, irrespective of colour, caste, religion or gender.  That is not being upheld at the moment.  <\/p><p> It is important to note that our staff and beneficiaries do not have access to any money.  In a post-conflict phase such as the one Afghanistan is now in, people cannot rebuild their lives.  Humanitarian aid is being hampered, specifically at Boost Hospital where there is huge pressure on resources.  The hospital is seeing up to 1,000 patients per day, which compromises the quality of care.  Other services and facilities need to be operational in order for people to have basic access to healthcare.  I think I have covered the questions that were asked.  Is there anything else outstanding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Ardagh, mentioned the matter of funding, as indeed did Senator Joe O'Reilly.  I might narrow that focus by asking has the global Covid-19 pandemic in any way adversely affected donor funding for MSF.  What is MSF's relationship with any states on the matter of funding?<\/p> <p>  While I have the floor, I ask our guests to focus on two areas.  The first is the Tigray region of Africa and the dire humanitarian situation which exists there.  I note there have been calls for formal political engagement aimed at the cessation of violence which, if attained, would allow for humanitarian aid to be delivered.  Access to humanitarian aid in that region seems to me to be of particular importance, having regard to current weather patterns, the dangerous and conflicted situation, the failure of crops, the movement of people, starvation, hunger and famine.  Have our guests seen any improvement in the situation in Tigray in recent weeks as far as the capacity to deliver aid is concerned?<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the situation on the borders of Belarus and the European Union, with particular reference to Poland and Lithuania.  In her initial contribution, Ms Simpson was direct, as we would expect, when she said that the European Union has failed to protect life.  I acknowledge, of course, that her organisation comprises medical expertise and that in the course of her advocacy and work, she is always mindful of the need to be politically impartial, independent of politics and neutral in her comments.  We on the other side of this meeting are political practitioners.  Ireland is an active member of the European Union.  We pride ourselves on our membership of the European Union, which is strongly supported by the Irish people.  Ms Ossig, when considering the EU border situation, spoke of initiatives and the position taken by the European Commission which she described as setting a dangerous precedent in terms of forthcoming policy positions.  Would it be in order for me to ask what might this committee do, having regard to the fact that we are active members of the European Union?  We see on a daily basis, particularly in recent times, a dangerous build-up of military capacity in this region.  We have not in recent times, but in the course of the mid-winter and December we saw on our screens the forest conditions, particularly on the Belarus side of the border.  Ms Ossig gave evidence to the effect that people are freezing in the forest in a way that would seem contrary to any focus on a humanitarian situation or human rights.  Would our guests be in a position to offer us their best advice as to what we might do, as a foreign affairs and defence committee, in the context of Ireland's membership of the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I will go back to the funding question first.  We did, in fact, stop taking funding from any EU member state in 2016, as Deputy Stanton said.  That was a direct response to the EU-Turkey deal, which traded billions in aid for the effective outsourcing of border control and the subsequent measures and policies that were carried out in response to the movement of people.  As a humanitarian organisation, we found that incompatible with our principles.  Therefore, we decided that as long as the EU-Turkey deal was in operation, we would not received funding from any EU member states.  At that time, we were the only international organisation ever to give money back to Irish Aid, which used to fund us generously.  As an international organisation, we are 97% privately funded.  I am proud to say that we have 100% private income in Ireland from the very generous support of the Irish public.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Leahy touched on when she was talking about Afghanistan, our principles and independence are important to be able to address the needs of the vulnerable, as we see it.  That must not be attached to some government agenda or subject to other people who may try to manipulate funding in ways intended to serve their own agendas.  It is very precious to MSF that we are privately funded.  It gives us independence in our action and neutrality, and the possibility to treat those who we see as the most in need rather than those who others think are the most in need or groups of people to whom others do not want us to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance.<\/p><p>The very small bit of state funding we have comes largely from Canada and Japan but otherwise 97% of funding is private funding.  During Covid, we were in a very fortunate position because Covid has also has been a huge part of our work over the past two years.  Again, the public has responded to us in a very positive way so Covid has not had a detrimental effect on our funding.  During the Covid response, we had several programmes in Europe that under usual circumstances, we would normally not have considered launching but we had extensive programmes in European countries like Italy and Belgium.  We also have a very small intervention in Dublin where we partnered with an Irish organisation called Safetynet.  We set up a mobile Covid testing unit for vulnerable populations such as the homeless, those in direct provision and the Traveller community that Safetynet was able to operate and carry out testing on site.  <\/p><p> The next question concerned Tigray and Ethiopia.  Just over six months ago, three colleagues were killed in Tigray.  There is an ongoing investigation into their deaths.  For that reason, I am unable to elaborate on the situation in Tigray.  I can say that MSF does not have access to Tigray at the moment.  We would be open to giving individual briefings to any members of the committee who want to take the current situation in Ethiopia further but unfortunately, it is not something we can address publicly at the moment.  The situation relating to our colleagues is the priority and for that reason, I cannot discuss Ethiopia at present.  I apologise for that.  I will hand over to Ms Ossig, who can expand on the current EU proposal.  We also have an ask for this committee, which was in the closing statement but which I am very happy to address the committee after Ms Ossig speaks to it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Regarding funding, our intervention in Poland and Lithuania is an example where it is really important for us that these programmes are not funded by the EU or ECOFIN because we want distance from the political agenda.  Regarding comments on what can be done and that democracy seems to be in question in many countries, one of the most important points regarding Poland and Lithuania is the people need to get out of the forest.  It is still below zero in the forest and it is still snowing in Lithuania.  It has been snowing a couple of days ago and there are still children, women and men who are hiding in the forest on the European Union side because they do not have a safe, protected and unconditional way out of the forest.  They will continue to hide there until they can make their own way out of it.  We need to get them out of the forest because if we do not, the death toll will not stay at 21.  There will be more deaths because people will continue hiding because of the fear of being violently pushed back and not having any fundamental rights respected.  This is the major call from our side.  European member states and the European Union must find a way to get these people out of the forest unconditionally and provide them with a safe way to access their basic rights.<\/p> <p>  We also hope the countries that are concerned about the rights of the migrants will raise their voices towards the European Union and the European Commission to criticise and oppose the proposal that we believe is endangering respect for the fundamental rights of migrants.  The proposal, for example, allows an lengthened period for the registration of asylum applications of up to four weeks.  This will very likely come with automatic detention at the border posts.  The proposal also will allow people to be detained at the border posts where they will say they will be able to implement asylum procedures so they do not have to go to a registration centre any more, as it can be done at the border posts.  The proposal will allow the respective countries to, under the provision of only covering basic needs, detain people up to 16 weeks.  From our perspective, this is unacceptable because it violates any kind of asylum law that has been put in place and the EU asylum directive.  There is no exemption for vulnerable groups.  The screening of vulnerable groups and specific risks to groups regarding their home countries and potential deportation are not properly covered.  There is no call for humanitarian access.  The only call in the proposal is for vague co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.  There is no adequate monitoring mechanisms that will ensure that human rights are not violated to the extent that they are being violated at the moment by the national legislation put in place by Poland and Lithuania.  Our call is for concerns to be raised and objections to be made to the proposal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I reiterate our call for the committee to voice its concern to the Department of Foreign Affairs and EU counterparts regarding the continued pushback of people from European borders.  As Ms Ossig outlined, the European Commission proposal for exceptional measures is making this situation worse for people on the move and is setting a dangerous precedent.  European member states committed to protecting vulnerable people should oppose this proposal and instead should seek solutions that put people first and comply with international and EU obligations.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton commented on the risks our workers face and mentioned the loss of our colleagues in Tigray.  We have stringent security conditions in all our operational areas.<\/p><p>Our staff have security training and we have protocols and guidelines in place that hopefully, in the majority, keep our staff safe.  It is stressful, as the committee member pointed out.  Personally, I worked in the field for 25 years before I came to Dublin to take up this position with MSF Ireland.  We know the risk and know the things that can happen but it does not stop the humanitarian impulse and the passion we feel for our work.  As a medical organisation, of course, we try to take the best care of all of our staff, whether they are international or locally hired.  At the moment, globally, MSF has over 40,000 international and locally hired staff working in over 70 different countries.<\/p><p> Perhaps my colleagues would like to add to that, as they have been involved in this area.

This is why community engagement is important for us and we need to constantly redefine and adjust our programmes to the needs of the population.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the psychological impact, I am happy to say I strongly believe we are doing very well in terms of providing psychological supports to our team, and that is not just to our international staff members but to our national staff members as well, who are often a bit forgotten in the discussion.  For us, it may be dangerous to go into several countries but for the majority of our staff, it is very dangerous to continue living in their countries because they are affected every single day, as are their families, while we are going in for a short period and then stepping out again.  Often, we potentially have better protection just by being someone who is not from the local context and who is probably perceived as a bit more removed than our national staff could be.  We have a team of psychosocial support units available to all of our staff, including national staff, with a 24-hour hotline in different languages, including in Arabic, so our staff can access that support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We do not have armed protection or security on any of our projects.

As they have heard from me and my colleagues, the communities that MSF assists are dealing with multiple and, at times, very complex challenges.  I hope they have been motivated by the briefing.  For us speaking out is the first step to try to effect change.  In regard to Afghanistan, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res reminds donors that humanitarian assistance is now more important than ever.  Support to the population needs to be maintained regardless.  Donors must find a way to ensure that continuous funding of essential humanitarian programmes in healthcare but also across other sectors is maintained, including support to food security.  As we have discussed today what has made many situations more complex for us over the past two years, for communities and medical staff on the ground in all our project locations, is the Covid-19 pandemic.  Due to the inequalities that exist, communities with little or no access to vaccines, treatments and tests are now more vulnerable.  While vaccine production is increasing, access inequity remains a concern when demands for booster vaccines continue to grow.  To ensure sustainable supply globally and to break from the current unequal production and supply structure globally, it remains important that countries are supported to engage local production and supply.<\/p> <p>  Intellectual property barriers in Covid-19 go beyond vaccines and also include therapeutics, diagnostics and key materials and components needed for the productions.  MSF Ireland asks this committee to continue its work on vaccine inequity and to write to the Government expressing its support of the recent Seanad motion supporting the TRIPS waiver.  Additionally, MSF asks this committee to write to the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment urging it to hold a public meeting on Ireland's position on the TRIPS waiver where it can call in expert witnesses in this field.  Furthermore, in recognition of the people on the move and their right to seek asylum within the EU's borders we reiterate to the Department of Foreign Affairs the need to voice its concerns with EU counterparts regarding the push-backs, not to support the proposal but instead to protect vulnerable people.  Put people first, and seek solutions that comply with international and EU obligations.

That is testament to the very real and dangerous work undertaken by their members on behalf of the humanitarian needs of people on a daily basis.  I am loath to offer congratulations to them on their 50th anniversary because it is a word that Ms Simpson indicated she would not use.

We wish them well, and safety for future years in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  Our members listened carefully to witnesses' comment on the matter of the TRIPS waiver.  We have engaged with our fellow Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and have been in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs; in fact we produced a report on this issue as far back as last March.  It is an issue that has exercised members of our committee.

I am delighted to have been invited before the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health to discuss the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.  As members are aware, the Ombudsman for Children's office, OCO, is an independent statutory body, which was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, as amended.  The OCO has two core statutory functions, which are, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public services, public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have, adversely affected a child.<\/p> <p>  Promoting the rights and welfare of children experiencing mental health difficulties has been a strategic priority for this office since 2016.  As members of the sub-committee may be aware, the OCO has previously expressed serious concerns about the statutory framework provided for under the Mental Health Act 2001 in respect of children, as well as about delays in progressing corresponding legislative reforms in this area.  Accordingly, we welcome the publication of the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.<\/p><p>Following its most recent examination of Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of its obligations to children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended in 2016 that Ireland &ldquo;enact legislation that explicitly and comprehensively provides for children&rsquo;s consent to and refusal of medical treatment, and ensure that the legislation is in line with the objectives of the convention and encompass clear recognition of the evolving capacities of children&rdquo;.  The committee&rsquo;s strong expectation that the State will amend the 2001 Act in this regard is evident in the list of issues prior to reporting which the committee published in respect of Ireland, more recently, in November 2020. <br\/><br\/>The OCO&rsquo;s assessment of the current general scheme has focused on proposals which concern the admission and treatment of children to approved inpatient facilities, and, as such, on Part 8 of the scheme.  In this regard, we support the proposal to include a dedicated part focused on provisions affecting children under 18 years of age.  However, in our view, a number of the current proposals under Part 8 do not have sufficient regard to children&rsquo;s rights and evolving capacities and do not provide adequately for a child-centred, rights-based approach regarding children&rsquo;s admission to, and treatment in, approved inpatient facilities. <br\/><br\/>Members of the sub-committee have a copy of the OCO&rsquo;s observations on Part 8, which we submitted in December 2021.  In the remaining time, I would like to highlight a number of issues addressed in our observations.  Head 104, section 84 sets out guiding principles that will apply in respect of children.  We welcome that these are intended to guide all decisions made in respect of the admission and treatment of children under Part 8 and, as such, that these proposed principles will guide the decisions made by mental health care professionals and the courts.  We also welcome the provision made for the best interests of the child to be treated as the primary consideration via head 104, section 84(a).  We suggest that consideration should be given to making appropriate provision for the factors that need to inform an assessment and determination of what is in the best interests of the child, taking into account relevant international human rights standards. <br\/><br\/>While the proposed guiding principles have the potential to promote a more child-centred approach to decisions affecting children under 18 years, we are of the view that the current provisions, including those concerning the views of the child, need to be strengthened.  In this regard, we believe that further consideration needs to be given to the relationship between the proposed guiding principles; how the provisions made in relation to the proposed principles can guide their appropriate application in practice; and including additional principles, a number of which we outline in our observations. <br\/><br\/>We welcome the attention given to strengthening provisions for children&rsquo;s right to be heard in decisions regarding their admission to, and treatment in, approved inpatient facilities.  This includes the provisions made for children aged 16 years and older to be able to consent to their admission, including the presumption that any child aged 16 years or older has capacity to consent to or refuse admission to an approved inpatient facility.  <br\/><br\/>However, we are concerned about provisions made in relation to children under 16 years of age.  For instance, we have significant concerns about the proposed scope of &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; admissions in respect of children under 16, whereby the admission of such a child will be deemed &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; on the basis of the consent of the child&rsquo;s parent or parents or person or persons acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  We are of the view that this fails to give appropriate recognition to the child&rsquo;s status as a subject of rights and we suggest that serious consideration needs to be given to applying the category of intermediate person to children under 16 years who are admitted on the basis of parental consent. <br\/><br\/>We welcome that the proposed guiding principles make it standard that children should be cared for and treated in an age-appropriate environment.  However, that this provision is accompanied by the clause &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo;, and that the scheme permits the admission of children to adult inpatient facilities, is a symptom of a systemic failure on the part of the State.  That failure has been maintained over many years and means that, 15 years after Vision for Change, we still do not have sufficient appropriate child and adolescent mental health services and supports available.  I ask that the sub-committee is strong and ambitious about this issue and that it seek to prevent all admissions of children under 18 years to adult inpatient units.<br\/><br\/>The OCO is among a range of stakeholders that have highlighted the need for children and young people with mental health difficulties to have access to independent, specialised advocacy services.  We welcome the provisions under the general scheme for children admitted as voluntary, intermediate or involuntary persons to be entitled to engage an advocate, either by themselves or with their parent or parents or person or persons acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  In this regard, we are of the view that appropriate advocacy services need to be made available to all children who wish to avail of them, irrespective of means, and that children should be supported to access such services.<\/p><p>We also welcome the provision under head 117, section 97(1), that in every case brought to the court under Part 8, a legal representative must be appointed to the child.  As regards the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, section 97(3) provides for the court to also appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>for the child &quot;unless it is not in the best interests of the child&quot;.  While the circumstances in which it might not be in the best interests of a child to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>are unclear, we are strongly of the view that there should be a presumption in favour of appointing a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The proposals set out in the 2021 general scheme in respect of children present a significant opportunity to legislate for a child rights-based approach to decision making in respect of children who may require inpatient care and treatment for their mental health.  It is crucial that these provisions are fit for purpose.<br\/><br\/>We thank the committee again for the invitation to this meeting today.  My colleagues, Dr. Karen McAuley and Mr. Diego Castillo Goncalves, and I will be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.

Who would engage on behalf of children under 16?  My second question relates to young people with physical disabilities.  I refer young people who are non-verbal, who have hearing or vision impairments or a multitude of those and who obviously also have mental health issues.  Has Dr. Muldoon's office given any consideration to how they should be treated, particularly those who are under 16?  This may be a small group of young people, but it is a group that is profoundly affected.  If these young people fall into a situation where their mental health is compromised or challenged, it that can be very serious, especially if they are non-verbal.  I ask Dr. Muldoon and his colleagues to give us their thoughts on those two issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#C00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I will take the last point first.  For young people with physical disabilities, including those who are non-verbal, there has always been a huge difficulty with what is called dual diagnosis, where a child has a learning disability and a mental health issue.  There is really limited access to mental health services.  What we are looking at here is trying to formulate child rights-based legislation that will allow for the services to be provided in a child-centred way.  We will need to have the services and resources in place and the professionals available who can understand and work with children in those circumstances.  They need to be trained to hear the voice of the child, however that is transmitted.  Non-verbal children will often use painting or sound to communicate in some way and there are people who understand how to work with those children and young people, including psychologists, special needs workers and others working in that area.  Parents can help a lot as well.  It is something in which we really need to invest time and energy.  If we work from the single point of view that every child's voice is important in these circumstances, then we need to be able to facilitate those children whether they are blind, deaf, non-verbal or acting out with challenging behaviour.  Once they have a mental health issue that necessitates admission to an inpatient unit, that unit needs to be fit for purpose to deal with those children and young people.  I would hope there is progression within this proposed legislation to allow that to start happening - to hear those voices properly.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Castillo Goncalves to respond to the question on the intermediate person and to expand on our thoughts in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question.  We very much welcome the provision of a third category of admission for children who are aged 16 and over and who lack capacity but who do not fulfil the criteria for involuntary detention.  Regarding the category of intermediate persons, we note that the definition that applies to children in the general scheme currently is one which means that a child who lacks capacity to consent to his or her admission but has been admitted with the consent of his or her parents or parents acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  This means that the child does not have the capacity to consent and does not actually fulfil the criteria for detention.<\/p><p>That means the child is not going to be detained, but will have the same review mechanisms and protections that are afforded to those who are in voluntary detention.  This will mean, for instance, that a child who is admitted as an intermediary person could leave the approved inpatient facility at any stage, subject to the agreement of his or her parents or guardians in this respect.<\/p><p> We note that a number of stakeholders, such as the former special rapporteur on child protection, have previously recommended provision for a category of intermediary person for children admitted on the basis of parental consent.  We also note that when they made those recommendations, they did not put an age limit on them, as is currently provided for in the heads of the Bill.  We are of the view that serious consideration needs to be given to applying the category of intermediary person to children who are under 16 and who are admitted on the basis of parental consent.

There seems to be contradictions between the amendment of this Act, which seeks to give 16- and 17-year olds the capacity to consent to their mental healthcare, but it does not seem to be doing the same in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act in relation to wardships of court.  Do the witnesses think that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act should be amended while we are waiting for the reform of the Mental Health Act?  Do they have any concerns about what will happen if it is not addressed at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and we have to wait for this Bill to move through both Houses?  My understanding is that it has taken seven years to get to the point following the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to provide for under-18s.

In this respect, we note that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, as referred to by the Deputy, does not apply to persons under 18 and therefore it does not seem that it will apply to capacity assessments that will be conducted in respect of children under this general scheme.

It is a draconian practice and, as he highlighted, we need to get rid of it at this stage.  It seems that some of the most vulnerable children, with acute mental health needs, are admitted to adult psychiatric hospitals.  It is a frightening experience for any child to be admitted to a hospital for mental health reasons but that is made worse and exacerbated if the child is admitted to an adult psychiatric ward that does not meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  Last year, 27 children were placed in adult psychiatric facilities.  While I acknowledge that this figure is a good deal lower than in previous years, which is welcome, it is still 27 children too many.  The children and young people who were placed in these facilities are already in an incredibly difficult place with their mental health.  This practice is, therefore, unacceptable.  Will Dr. Muldoon elaborate on capacity issues in youth mental health services, such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and other youth mental health services?  I will also raise this matter during statements on youth mental health in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.

In my first couple of years as ombudsman, I felt it was okay to keep this option open.  However, what is happening now is we have become lazy about it and we have let the idea that we do not have the resources in place rule the fact that the best interest of the child is being overrun.  We need to move forward from that.  That is why I am asking for a nil or zero option in regard to putting children into adult wards.<\/p> <p>  We did a report in 2018 titled, Take My Hand, in which we talked to children in those adolescent inpatient units.  A number of them talked about the trauma they went through going into adult wards.  As the Deputy said, while they were in their lowest ebb in life - they may have been suicidal or already have attempted something - the best service we could offer them was an adult psychiatric ward, which is scary at the best of times.  We cannot allow that to happen any more.  If we continue with this as it is, we will be legislating it into practice and we will need an amendment in the future to stop it.<\/p><p>At the moment, it is just a practice where people have let themselves go and the habit has built up that we do not have enough beds.  That is not an excuse any more, as far as I am concerned.  We need to put those resources in place and the only way we can force that to happen is to make it a zero option so people cannot do it.  We also have to be aware that even to have children go into paediatric wards is not a positive step forward either, and we need to properly facilitate our children.

I want to reinforce one of the points that Dr. Muldoon made earlier.  Members will recall there was a Private Members&rsquo; Bill dating back to 2016, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016, which was examined by a previous Joint Committee on Health in 2019.  We submitted our observations on the Bill, which had the best of intentions and was not endorsing the admission of children to adult facilities.  What it was doing was recognising that the practice occurs and seeking to put safeguards in place regarding the admission of children to adult units.  One of the concerns we expressed at the time was that an unintended consequence of doing that would be to establish a legal basis, if we like, for admitting children to adult units.  In effect, the current general scheme will do just that and it will establish a legal basis for doing it.  Therefore, while we acknowledge that, under the general principles, one of the guiding principles is to try to ensure that children are admitted to age-appropriate facilities, the &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo; piece that the Deputy referenced earlier, as well as head 128, which is the dedicated head in Part 8 dealing with the admission of children to approved adult facilities, effectively legislates for the admission of children to these facilities.<\/p><p>Our concern, as Dr. Muldoon mentioned, is that if we legislate for this, it may exacerbate what is already a protracted delay in implementing the measures and putting in place the resources to allow for an end to this practice.

To return to the issue of consent, I am trying to understand something mentioned in our guests&rsquo; opening statement and the information they sent us in September.  It relates to cases of children under the age of 16, where the consent of the guardian comes into play.  The September submission referred to assessing maturity.  Who does that and how does it work?  It may be a simplistic question, but is there a lower age bracket, similar to the lower age that applies to responsibility in law?  The principle of consent applies to children under the age of 16, but is there a point below which we do not assess maturity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#G00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I might come in here and touch on our concerns regarding consent for under-16s.  In this respect, we acknowledge the expert group recommended in 2015 that there should not be an automatic presumption of capacity for children under the age of 16 and that the provisions made in respect of children under 16 are in line with the recommendations made by the expert group.  We have no immediate difficulty with that proposal.  We also support the involvement of the child's parent or guardian in decision-making regarding the child's prospective admission and treatment in an approved facility.<\/p> <p>  However, having regard to the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we are concerned that the use of a purely age-based approach in respect of children who are under 16 does not have sufficient regard to the evolving capacities of children, including in regard to making decisions about their own mental health and treatment.  In this respect, we would favour the more nuanced approach that was previously proposed by the Law Reform Commission and the special rapporteur on child protection.<\/p> <p>  It might be helpful to explain what we mean by this nuanced approach.  We suggest provision could be made such that a child under 16 years could give or refuse consent to his or her admission, care or treatment in circumstances where it has been established the child has the maturity and understanding to appreciate the nature and consequences of the specific decision in regard to his or her admission or treatment.  This would arise when the young person understands the treatment, why it is being recommended and what will happen if he or she accepts or refuses it.  In our view, this case-by-case basis approach would be more aligned with a child rights-based approach and with relevant provisions of both the Convention on Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It can be seen in other jurisdictions, including the UK and Canada, as referred to earlier.  In Canada, for instance, there is not an age-based approach at all.<\/p> <p>  As for who will make the decision, one concern we have is that, although the guiding principles provide for a child of under 16 who is capable of forming his or her own views to be consulted and to have due weight given to his or her views, the heads of the Bill appear to be silent on the matter the Deputy raised relating to who will assess and determine whether a child of under 16 is capable of forming those views and how this will be done.  It also appears that the heads of the Bill, in their current form, are silent on what measures will be taken to ensure due weight will be given to the child's views, including in regard to his or her proposed admission.  Another concern is that a subsection of the general principles relating to whether a child under the age of 16 is capable of forming his or her own views includes a provision for the child to be consulted where practicable.  Our view is this provision should be deleted; the child should always be consulted.<\/p><p>Further attention needs to be given to this as well as to another provision under the guiding principles in regard to giving due weigh to the views of the child and that how they interact with the views that are given by the parents or by the guardian.

There are a couple things I might add on that.  First, allowing that this is general scheme and not the actual Bill and therefore the wording may be adjusted, I would flag the way it is currently set out under section 97(3).  It states that a GAL would be appointed unless it is not in the child's best interests.  We find that an unusual form of wording in and of itself, irrespective even of what the child care (amendment) Bill will say about the appointments of GAL in care proceedings.  This is primarily because it raises the question of what circumstances would it not be in the best interest of the child to appoint a GAL?  Whether it is necessary, etc., is a different question.  However, it suggests that it would not be in their best interests.  We think that needs clarification.  It may just be that the wording is a bit awkward, to be fair, but we do not know that.  The reason we think that is because one of the core roles of a GAL is to recommend to the court what is in the best interest of the child.  That is one of its fundamental functions.  That is the first point.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the child care (amendment) Bill 2021 was published last autumn.  As the Deputy knows, it is looking to do a number of things.  It is to set out in law the role and functions of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, etc.  In the current wording, again allowing that this is the general scheme, two things are worth noting.  First, in proceedings before the High Court, a GAL is automatically appointed.  For example, in proceedings relating to the placement of a child in secure care or special care, a GAL is automatically appointed.  Obviously, that is a form of civil detention, if you like, which involves a deprivation of liberty.  The admission of a child for inpatient care, for example, particularly in context of involuntary admission and detention, therefore, is also a form of detention.  We have to think about that and about parity there.<br\/><br\/>The other piece on the child care (amendment) Bill 2021 is on the proceedings in the District Court.  These are obviously care proceedings.  I appreciate the idea is that the District Court will be involved in such proceedings under this legislation.  What is provided for at the moment is more or less aligned with a presumption in favour of appointing a GAL.  It states that the court shall appoint a guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>for the child unless the best interests of the child can be determined in another way and unless the court is satisfied that there is another way to facilitate the child to be heard.  Therefore, it is a much more positive way of framing it.  Going back to the current general scheme, it may just be a question of wording that needs to be adjusted.  However, from our perspective it is not clear when it would not be in the best interest of the child.  As well as this, the wording seems strange.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>It does, because the wording seemed strange to me.

This is that for admission to be voluntary there has to be an element of voluntarism involved.  If you are a child and for whatever reason you have concerns or reservations and do not wish to be admitted, for example, your admission, in plain English, is not voluntary.  There is no voluntary element to it.  This is not to critique parents in any way, but the idea that we provide in law that a child who expresses a wish not to be admitted would be admitted as a voluntary person solely on the basis of the consent of his or her parent is wrong.

It just gives us a little more guidance in that regard and more respect to the child's voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>What happens in the case of a child under the age of 16 with, say, an acute eating disorder, who, without medical treatment in a medical situation, will die because of a lack of food and so forth?

I will talk in hypothetical terms.  Allowing that there are only four State-funded inpatient units in the country, a child may have to move quite far away from his or her family, community and friends and the child may be concerned about that.  A child could be frightened about the prospect of being admitted to an inpatient facility if he or she has not been in one before.  There could be lots of reasons a child might refuse which could, potentially, be addressed professionally through consultation and seeking to alleviate concerns.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the legislation, members will know that one of the guiding principles, which is set out under head 104, is about the best interests of the child being treated as the primary consideration.  From a children's rights point of view, the way that is supposed to operate is that when assessing and making a decision about what is in the best interests of the child, one seeks to hear the views of the child on whatever decision one is trying to make, for example, the admission of a child to an inpatient facility, and give due weight to his or her views.  That is not the same thing as the child determining the decision.  If someone is trying to figure out what is in the best interests of this child, he or she must seek to hear what the child's views, wishes and preferences are, understand them and take them into account.  However, when someone is charged with making a decision that is in the best interests of the child and that is the primary thing he or she must think about, that is going to guide the decision-making.  The guiding principles allow for that.<\/p> <p>  I apologise for going a little off the point in answering the question but I will mention two important points, one of which we have flagged.  From the way the legislation is written right now, allowing that this is a general scheme and not the actual wording of the Bill, it is not clear how these principles are going to interact.  The text sets out a list of principles but does not say how they relate to one another.  Further attention needs to be given to that.  For example, there is nothing to suggest what I have just talked about, which is critical from a children's rights point, namely, that when assessing what is in a child's best interests, hearing the child's views is a pivotal part of that.  There is nothing in the principles to suggest that, however.  That is one of the reasons we have suggested that it would be worthwhile considering including in the Bill a provision setting out what are the factors that a decision maker, whether it is a health professional or a court, needs to consider when making a determination about what is in the best interests of the child.  We have that already in Irish law and we referenced it under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Adoption Act.  There are clear factors that are laid out, a list of things that one must think about when deciding what is in the best interests of the child.  It would be very helpful for decision makers to have an equivalent and appropriate list provided for under this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I do not know if those circumstances are rare but in such circumstances, the child can be involuntarily detained in his or her best interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00400","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>The child could say and has the capacity to say that he or she does not want to seek treatment.<\/p><p>Obviously, the best interests of the child, medically and legally, would then be for him or her to be involuntarily detained to seek treatment.  It is quite a complex issue.<\/p><p> I have a final question on children aged between 16 and 18 years.  Assisted capacity essentially means a person of an age can make an independent decision regarding his or her own health, and so forth.  That is probably not the best definition but that is what I have come up with.  On children aged between 16 and 18 years, what is the determination about a child who is maybe in the throes of a pretty dire mental health situation and absconds or says he or she does not want treatment?  The child could be in a situation where he or she is very traumatised.  What happens in that situation, especially for that age group of young people?  Again, we come back to the point of the best interests of the child.  In circumstances, does that apply to that age group, namely, those aged under 16 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00600","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy is talking about the same situation.  He originally used the example of the eating disorder, which is hugely traumatic and invasive for the young person.  He or she will have his or her beliefs and will stick by them.  That will often mean that even if that young person weighs 7 stone, he or she will still not want to get help or will think that everything is okay.  In these circumstances, as Dr. McAuley outlined there, the important thing is we give weight to his or her voice and listen to them, especially when they are aged between 16 and 17 years.  At the same time, if it is a life or death scenario, the best interests may override that and it may be a situation in which we need to legally and medically take charge.  That is not going to change.  What has not happened before is that listening to the voice and the evolving capacity of the children and young people means the next time you have to make a decision about them it is going to be a bit easier because you have listened to them.  You have said to them that you are listening to them but we are still going to make this decision, although next time, we may listen and do something different.  Again, that creates a sense of hope within the child.  It creates a sense of being heard and being recognised as an individual.  The child will not like the answer but it creates an opportunity to build those relationships more strongly in the future.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, all it is is we are telling you that you are going in; that is all there is to it and there is no more about it.  However, we are now trying to build legislation that ensures children's voices are heard as best as possible based on their capacity.  However, it still does not override things - if it is a life-or-death scenario, as you would expect, it would not necessarily be the only answer.  That is same in many decisions, not just ones that concern mental health or medical treatment.  Children's voices and views are heard but other decisions can be made.  When we talk about children's rights, we always say to children it does not guarantee that what they want will happen but it will be heard and it will be heard and explained if it goes in a different direction.<\/p> <p>  Does that help?

It has been an interesting debate, particularly on foot of Deputies' comments in the context of when a child's capacity medically has changed and when the medical issue takes precedence, especially when it is a matter of life or death or in those circumstances that were outlined previously.  <\/p> <p>  Returning to some of the points Dr. Muldoon mentioned in his opening statement, he acknowledged this legislation seeks to strengthen the voice of the child.  He is the ombudsman and his office is focused on the rights of children under the age of 18 and ensuring that the voice of the child is heard.  Dr. McAuley gave some good examples of what is involved in reaching a consensus with a child.  An importance aspect is that the consultative process is done and the child&rsquo;s voice is heard.  There may be some ways to reach a consensus position with the child and the parents, particularly in the type of facility referenced.  I might explore that further.  Will Dr. Muldoon indicate one or two scenarios where the importance of hearing the voice of the child might lead to a positive outcome for the mental health of the child? <\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned children not being admitted to adult facilities and so on.  The challenge is accessing places when children are in acute episodes.  Will Dr. Muldoon give an example of what it might look like when a child in going through the process of an acute episode?  There is probably guidance available from the ombudsman's office for parents dealing with those dramatic situations but does another element need to be added to the legislation with respect to a crisis, acute situation?  I appreciate the detail Dr. Muldoon has provided,including the advocacy role of the office.  Those are a few comments.  I appreciate Dr. Muldoon has already gone through much of the finer detail with my colleagues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#N00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>If I picked the Senator up right, she put it well when she asked about the possibility of consultation to reach consensus.  That almost steps away from the medical model that has been in place for 100 years, namely, the patriarchal idea that \"I know best and I will medicalise you to make you better\".  Consultation and consensus is at the core of children's rights.  The legislation is moving in that direction, which is extremely positive.<\/p> <p>  Moving on some examples, the most difficult one, which Deputy Kenny spoke about, is bringing a child into a unit.  Some children will not want to go in.  It is important to negotiate and engage with children, understand where they are coming from and allay their fears and one would still probably have to bring them into a unit.  That discussion is probably the most important one because that would be at a time of acute episodes, as the Senator mentioned.  The other negotiation that is extremely important is when children sometimes do not want to leave an inpatient unit because it has become their safe space.  Having been in such a unit for eight to six eight weeks it could be scary for them to return to the world they left where they may have been hurt and the harm or negative thoughts became larger than life for them.  The best interests of the child are taken into consideration in that negotiation.  In many circumstances children will often leave a unit for a weekend and come back into the unit for five days and then leave again.  It is a matter of working with the child to find the best way to support him or her to return to the outside world.  That is a real example of listening to the voice of the child.  There might be a cross-over with respect to acute episodes.  In terms of the concept of a child being at his or her lowest ebb, whether the child has been taken out of a river following an attempted suicide, having abused alcohol or drugs or whatever it might have been that brought the child to the stage of attempting suicide, access to child-centred specialised services is crucial.<\/p><p>That is why we are pushing for zero tolerance for admission to adult units.  What happens in an adult unit is the child is put into a room on his or her own and is specialled.  Somebody sits with him or her and that is all they do.  We have had cases where children have been seriously afraid of the individuals around them, who may be experiencing serious psychotic episodes and may be much bigger and stronger than the child.  If a child is experiencing an acute episode, therefore, we have to provide the services and the flaw is on our side, as a State, if we do not provide them.<\/p><p> This is why we feel we should call time on the openness in regard to allowing children to be admitted to those units when necessary and to demand zero tolerance for it.  We need to get in there, invest our resources and ensure no children, in the most terrible and traumatic circumstances in which they can find themselves, will have to face additional trauma on top of that.  I heard a radio interview last week with a man talking about how spending even 24 hours in an adult unit had set him back by about two years in his recovery.  He was 17 at the time.  We really need to move forward on this issue.<\/p><p> I hope my response covered the answers the Senator was seeking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The experience Dr. Muldoon outlined is crucial to understanding the impact of this.

Sometimes I wonder about the supports that are in place for the adults around the child to bring him or her down the right path.  It can be a lack of awareness or of knowledge.  Dr. Muldoon spoke about having a legal representative, the appointment of a guardian and the intermediate person status.  We need to ensure the people around the child are able to provide, and allow for, that child-centred approach to take place, and there are many factors in that.

I mentioned earlier a young man who had spent months in a children's unit even though he was required to be admitted to a psychiatric facility.  He also had an intellectual disability.  That dual diagnosis is really difficult for people to cope with but he was the one who had to compromise.  We compromised his care rather than find the suitable resources and way of doing it.  There have been crises and public outcries over people sleeping on floors when waiting for units.  Even when they are admitted to a unit, they will be just given a chair because there are no free beds.  That is on us as a society and State.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman was involved in the previous committee on this issue.  The mental health budget is miniscule.  We examined the only figures we could get.  Only 5.6% of the health budget relates to mental health.  I have been through this with many people.  We do not have a figure for how much we spend on children within mental health.<\/p><p>The best guesstimate I can come up with is that 20% of the mental health budget is spent on children, which means less than 1.1% of the overall health budget is spent on children's mental health.

Even if we doubled the money spent on children, my guess is that it would make a huge inroad into those situations.<\/p><p> To me, the crux is to try to force the decisions of the Government so it cannot allow children to go into adult units any longer.

I thank her for a very detailed and lengthy written submission she sent into us in which she raised some very interesting aspects about how we can best utilise public realm space because it is not just about full occupancy or full residential use of a town.

The committee intends to compile a report from this with recommendations on a number of areas we could look at, consider and promote to encourage what we would like to try to do.<\/p> <p>  I will read a short note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Members attending in the meeting room or remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meeting.  This means they will have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.<\/p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy, and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with any such direction.

If any of the witnesses wish to come in on a question, I ask them to raise their hand and I can bring them in.  We will do seven-minute slots initially and then, if we have time at the end, we will go into a third round of questions.<\/p> <p>  I will first turn to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I invite Ms Graham to make the opening statement on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#A00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to speak today.  As the Chair mentioned, I am joined by Mr. Paul Hogan, principal planning adviser, and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan, who deals with vacancy, among other things, in the Department.<\/p> <p>  In the interests of time, I will highlight some of the things from the opening statement that members have.  As the Chair mentioned, I will focus on Housing for All, which recognises that at a time of such high housing need, we need to ensure the houses we already have are being fully used.  A specific pathway outlines actions to tackle the blight of vacancy and dereliction, which is a feature of many of our towns and villages.  The imminent launch of the Government's town centre policy will set a framework for local authorities to work in partnership with local stakeholders to tackle many of the issues that affect not only the choices of tenure and the supply of housing in towns, but also the wider economic and social progress.<\/p> <p>  I will address some issues in the statement around funding, regulation and enabling actions, and we have separately provided a note on data issues, because there is a very real need for location-specific data that allow for action plans to be developed that are specific to the local need and informed by best practice.  That is why we are focused on improving the data and research on vacancy, including through the harvesting of information from local property tax returns.<\/p> <p>  Turning to funding, it would appear there are two types of areas of vacancy and dereliction that need addressing.  There are urban areas of some scale that require significant regeneration, reimagining and repurposing to meet the housing and other needs of the areas.  There are also individual properties that are suitable for redevelopment for residential use.  In terms of broader regeneration, significant funding has been made available through the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, and town and village renewal schemes.<\/p><p>Through the URDF almost &euro;1.3 billion has been allocated to regeneration projects in cities and &euro;323 million has been allocated to projects in towns, in addition to the rural funding of &euro;255 million.  Housing for All and the national development plan reflect the proposed separation of the URDF into streams for cities and towns in the future, and to the inclusion of specific criteria on tackling vacancy.  This is part of a wider objective of supporting integrated urban development on brownfield sites in line with the national planning framework.  In support of the town centre first policy, a further URDF call for projects for towns is planned for later this year.  That will follow on from the fourth call for RRDF projects which is currently under way through the Department of Rural and Community Development.<\/p><p> In other areas where significant regeneration is not required, the refurbishment of property for residential use can enhance the vibrancy of towns and provide new and broader housing choices.  It can provide private housing in towns at affordable levels where there are currently few options, and it can provide new options for people with specific housing needs who also would benefit from proximity to other community and social services.  A substantially increased housing budget is available for social and affordable housing.  The Department is very open to considering options to refurbish buildings to meet these needs as part of those programmes.  In addition, Housing for All reflects a number of specific options such as the new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund, which the Deputy mentioned and which is focused on sites and the refurbishment of sites and vacant properties in towns; programmes for the compulsory purchase of appropriate property and reuse of public buildings; measures to unlock potential of heritage buildings to meet housing need; a new urban scheme under the European regional development fund that is being progressed to target vacancy and dereliction issues; and the use of the better energy homes grant to support the retrofit of vacant properties.  We will host a workshop for vacant homes officers later this week, which will assist us in finalising the terms and conditions of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and compulsory purchase programmes.<\/p><p> Housing for All also recognises the need for some regulatory change to increase the flow of vacant properties to the market.  This includes the reform of the fair deal scheme and the extension of planning exemptions to 2025 to complement the town centre first objectives.  The latter regulations will be presented to the committee shortly for consideration.  The Department is also engaging with local authorities to see if improvements can be made to the Derelict Sites Act, while the Law Reform Commission, LRC, is considering the compulsory purchase legislation.<\/p><p> While the provision of funding and clarity of regulation is important in tackling vacancy, there are challenges.  It is often riskier, involving more time and sometimes greater cost, to refurbish than to build a new property.  However, the costs of dereliction and vacancy in our cities, towns and villages are very high in societal terms.  <\/p><p> There is an important role for these projects to provide vision for towns, support pathfinder projects and provide encouragement and a one-stop shop approach to guide people through the development process.  In 2018 we issued our Bringing Back Homes manual to try to help people in bringing properties back into use.  Housing for All commits to vacant homes officers becoming full time and we issued a circular on that earlier this week.  Advisory support will be provided by the Housing Agency for some of the programmes.  Further supports will be given to local authorities as part of the town centre first approach.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the Department is firmly committed to tackling vacancy and dereliction as part of Housing for All.  This sits within the context of the overall national planning framework, which highlights the need for substantial levels of housing to come from the developments in the existing built-up areas of our towns and cities.  We are happy to answer any questions that the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Graham and appreciate her sticking to the five minutes.

The statement is structured across six points and concludes with a case study of the Clonakilty 400 master plan, which is a project completed over a ten-year period and can be seen as a live laboratory in measuring success of public realm and collaboration at urban regeneration at a town-scale level.  Clonakilty has been well illustrated in the submission to the committee and detailed information is also available through the various national and European awards the project has won.<\/p> <p>  The first point is to change the market by changing the ideal.  How do we bring people to live in a town centre?  Being able to reach services and facilities within 15 minutes' walking, including bumping into a friend, visiting one's granny on the way or sitting out under a tree on a sunny day is the magnet for people inhabiting traditional towns all over Europe.  However, the value of this sustainable way of life is not highlighted or made desirable to first-time buyers in the housing market.  The solution is that people need people.  People are attracted to people-friendly places.  The distinctive qualities of a town centre can prevail over the isolation of living in suburban sprawl if the public space they share is of the highest quality.  Providing civic living room spaces to all ages and backgrounds for people to meet and to linger longer.  A vibrant, functioning town centre for local communities is the most authentic, attractive experience for visitors, therefore, creating a destination that will reinforce the economic layer of tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has an excellent design guidelines document on this topic.<\/p> <p>  The second point is how we make desirable the view of public life over a private garden.  With density comes resilience.  As in the rest of EU, in my town in Italy, living above the shop, having a high floor-to-ceiling apartment with a window framing the view of a church dome is the most desirable location to live with the highest economic, social and cultural value.  My grandfather was an olive oil producer.  He used his Vespa every day to commute to his farm and return to his town centre where, on a Sunday, he would dress elegantly and walk in the street to meet his friends.  In contrast, the ideal in Ireland of living in the countryside has supported the spread of low density suburban and ribbon development which has many negative effects, including the hollowing out of town centres, a dependency on cars, isolation and mental health issues.<\/p> <p>  On the car society and urban design, we must change the paradigm.  The heritage streets of our towns are slowly being turned from streets into roads through the implementation of road engineering design standards to serve the motorists.  Irish towns have been brutalised by car-focused design, with a negative impact on public life and architectural fabric.  The legacy of new road infrastructures has also brought the conflicting and anti-urban trends of out-of-town retail and those fuel station plazas that continue to compete against town and village centres.  Action needs to be taken to create public lands with pedestrian priority forming safe, inclusive and socio-economically successful streetscapes.  Since its publication in 2013, a new design manual for urban roads and streets in the hands of a skilled designer is a game changer for town centres, if implemented successfully by a multidisciplinary team. <\/p> <p>  On new opportunities through European supports, the new European Bauhaus initiative with the green deal were formed to lead the cultural change in climate change action and helping to develop better functioning cities and towns around Europe.  Clonakilty 400 was selected as one of 33 European case studies to illustrate the key recommendations.  Worthy of research is the Italian Government's recent granting of incentives for structural and energy upgrading of existing fabric across Italian urban areas, providing up to 110% funding.  Since its introduction in 2020, it has been a game changer for the Italian economy while also facilitating the conservation and rehabilitation of urban centres and buildings.<\/p><p> My next point concerns urban design through public engagement.  Project Ireland 2040, with the national planning framework plan, has placed a focus on the revitalisation of Irish towns, and the recent Housing for All has heralded the town centre first initiative, which is a very welcome one in the programme for Government.  Invited as a panellist to the launch of Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, I recognised investment in rural Ireland as a very significant opportunity for rural towns, villages and communities in Ireland to provide transient and flexible workspaces.  However, the implementation of this policy must not be done in isolation without public engagement.  Only through meaningful and continuous public engagement can a strong sense of ownership of projects within the community be created that can lead to long-term success and pride of place across generations.<\/p><p> My final point refers to the implementation of ideas and the role of civic architects.  Westport 2000 and Clonakilty 400 are well-known successful examples of town regeneration and it is no coincidence these projects shared the same implementation structure of being led by a town architect.  Why was this?  Architects have a solid track record in interrogating the quality of the building environment and they are therefore well equipped to use their knowledge, experience and capacity to spark discussion about the quality goals of the environment.  As architects in councils, we are perfectly placed to co-ordinate the mostly disparate developments such as road, flood relief etc. to aesthetically pleasing outcomes.  During the town council era, town architect planning clinics were also provided in all Cork county towns. These were a unique example of public engagement processes where the civil servant architects assisted the private sector design process through informal over-the-counter architectural and planning advice.  This co-ordination process between the private and public sectors delivered sustainable outcomes in urban development.<\/p><p> I acted as a town architect for a number of towns in Cork county for ten years prior to the restructuring of the post with the abolition of town councils in 2014.  This role was effective and consideration should be given to municipal architects as problem solving, where, working with town planners and local engineers, they are uniquely positioned to engage, harness and promote civic input.  Community architects can act as the standard bearer of the town&rsquo;s built environment in preserving the local architectural character through quality design, public participation and place making, promoting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Giulia Vallone","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>My apologies to Ms Vallone but I must interrupt her as we have gone over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#C00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>It is finished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Giulia Vallone"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>However, I did want to allow Ms Vallone to get onto that section about the importance of county and town architects because I firmly believe and agree with that and in what they can bring to the overall process.

I will look briefly at the scale of demand and supply, particularly in the new-build sector.  Then I will look at existing land and building capacity for existing structures and the opportunities that are there.  I will then look at some of the barriers and the opportunities we have to remove these, which I will address at the end of the presentation.<br\/><br\/>On overall new housing output, we know that new-builds have increased from approximately 17,500 new homes in 2017 to 20,500 in 2020, which is a very welcome development.  The interesting thing is that when this supply is broken down into where it is going, we can see that the number of houses that have been available to households has remained pretty much flat in four years.  For example last year, of the 20,532 new homes built, nearly 5,000 were one-off homes which would never make it to the market, while the State and approved housing bodies purchased 4,715 from private developers and schemes.  They also built some in some areas.  Private non-households were also very active, with almost 3,500 new dwellings which were built or purchased.<br\/><br\/>We know then that the total figure for household purchases last year was around 7,425, which is slightly less than the number purchased in 2017.  Remarkably, in Dublin, the figure for new houses aimed at households has actually gone down.  We know that in the region of 28% fewer households purchased new homes last year in the four Dublin local authorities than in 2017, with a total of approximately 2,286 dwellings.  That is despite the fact the new homes output has gone up only by 8% in four years.  We have seen displacement by non-household entities in the new homes market.<br\/><br\/>In the social housing sector, we know Rebuilding Ireland was launched in 2017 and was meant to build 50,000 homes.  Four years later we have seen 5,335 new homes built by local authorities and approved housing bodies and around 10,000 turnkey purchases.  For every single home built by local authorities and approved housing bodies, two were purchased from the private sector.<br\/><br\/>The most absolute metric for additional homes to local authority stock is that there are no accurate figures.  We know that in four years, fewer than 10,000 additional homes from all sources were brought into stock for all of the local authorities, and that is an average of 659 in County Dublin for the four local authorities.  That contrasts quite markedly with the demand figure of around 120,000 households on the primary and secondary housing waiting lists.  That is a fairly big gap between supply and demand.<br\/><br\/>On land availability, we know that the land aggregation scheme in 2015 noted there was about enough zoned land for about 414,000 dwellings which were serviced and 600,000 which were in tier 2.  In 2017, the Rebuilding Ireland Land Map noted that there was enough public land for about 50,000 houses.  In actual fact, the figure was a great deal higher.<br\/><br\/>By 2020, looking at Dublin City Council, the capacity on its land was that it had approximately 85 ha left, excluding the Oscar Traynor Road and the O'Devaney Gardens sites, which are the subject, I believe, of votes today.  We also know that, remarkably, that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, disposed of just 7 ha in four years.  It has approximately 97 ha of land that is controlled and owned by their debtors.  Therefore, the combined land bank in the four Dublin local authorities in County Dublin is 182 ha, which is around 61% of all zoned vacant land, which is a huge number.  At O'Devaney Gardens, densities of 200 dwellings per hectare suggests the State controls land with somewhere in the region of a capacity for 36,000 dwellings.  This effectively means it controls the land market in Dublin city between the canals.<br\/><br\/>As to vacant buildings, we know that the most recent census had approximately 183,000 vacant homes.  That had reduced by approximately 46,000 from the previous census, so with a reasonable stab at a figure, we would have approximately 137,000 such homes.  That suggests around 40,000 existing dwellings are available over and above the normal rate of vacancy that could be brought back into stock relatively quickly.<br\/><br\/>We know that there have been a number of desktop studies, one of which has been done by UCC, the North Main Street study, and by the Dublin City Council, where it reckoned that, respectively, the capacity in city centre towns could be increased by almost 300% by targeting vacant infill sites and upper floors.  We know that in Dublin city, the capacity there was approximately 4,000 dwellings in existing buildings.  Critically, the census does not actually tackle or count the number of vacant spaces we have above the shops.<br\/><br\/>One of the key areas that I have looked at, which I will mention briefly, is our statutory permissions as a barrier to actual refurbishments.  Currently, we have planning which is being tackled by a pilot scheme brought in in 2018.  There are also disabled access, fire, and building control amendment regulations, BCAR, certificates, which are four separate processes, three of which are pre-commencement.  These are extensive, not only in terms of costs, but it takes up to five to six months for even a very simple change-of-use application to get to the point where you can commence work on site.  The difficulty is that because there are three different and separate strands, if you do not get one of those permissions, you cannot proceed.<br\/><br\/>It is not just the cost of it, which is something like ten times the cost of the same statutory permissions in the UK and Northern Ireland, it is the uncertainty of it.  You can get planning permission but if you do not get your fire or disabled access certificates, you cannot proceed and <i>vice versa<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>One of the proposals we put in back in 2017, with colleagues Orla Hegarty and Lorcan Sirr, was the idea of a streamlined process where you could go into a local authority, there might be three or four separate queues, you bring your drawings in and get them stamped, go through all the various different hoops and you come out the door with a permit.<\/p><p>It is similar to a scheme that has been used in the US for a long time.  A streamlined, over-the-counter process such as that would involve no diminution in existing building standards.  It would allow us to set up an integrated approach whereby if there are conflicts between a protected structure and the technical requirements for disabled access, for example, they could be looked at behind the counter.  A process like this could save in the region of five months out of that six-month application process, and save some 85% or 90% of the cost of a typical change of use application.  In one case in my practice the fit-out cost was less than &euro;30,000 for a 35 sq. m ground floor space, and the statutory permissions costs were more than &euro;10,000.  This is a very big problem.  It is not just about the costs; it is also the uncertainty associated with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mel Reynolds","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reynolds.

I am speaking to the committee in that capacity.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this invitation to attend.  My colleague, Mr. Odran Reid, and I will present two related but very different elements.  I will take the first aspect and I will then pass over to Mr. Reid.  I thank the committee for reading our submission material, and we look forward to the discussion and questions.<\/p> <p>  I will concentrate on the four main issues with regard to the different functions contained within land management including: the issue of data and associated skill sets; State lands in the context of land management; and the legislative aspects.<\/p> <p>  My own interests are in land, coastal and marine governance - and obviously I also look at the terrestrial aspect - and the management and administrative functions that are included in the interrelated systems and processes, which are land tenure, land value, land use and land development.  In research terms, this is called the land management paradigm.  This is a fancy term but in effect is just that those four functions deserve equal attention.  This will come into play when I talk about State lands.<\/p> <p>  Despite an array of commendable policy documents and strategies, and evidence of very good practice across the public sector generally, significant headway in the provision of housing has generally been slow to materialise.  It is clear, however, that the issue is not solely about the scarcity of land for greenfield development, nor is it just about the complexities of repurposing existing building stock into residential units, or, indeed, about the infrastructure needed to support such development.  Rather, it is evident that many facets of this challenge relate to policymakers and decision-makers not having ready access to appropriate, fit-for-purpose data to allow the level of analysis, spatial analysis and the locational intelligence required for the urgent next steps to happen.  I have tuned in and listened to previous committee sessions and I am aware that the committee has considered whether we are asking the right questions of such land and property-related policies and plan.  However, the more critical question is whether these policies and plans are sufficiently informed by appropriate and accurate, current and complete information.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the skill sets that are needed, it is very hard to establish a good baseline with respect to skill sets.  Certainly, the analysis required is quite tricky in trying to interpret, manipulate and manage very large datasets, multi-criteria site evaluations, public-facing interactive mapping, and needs quantification across local and central government.<\/p> <p>  With regard to State lands, statutory bodies are obliged under the Registration of Title Act 1964 to register all property acquired since July 1967.  Government direction in this regard has been clear and constant over the years.  The LDA's mandate is now to activate State lands, and it is imperative that we ensure such public sector assets lands and property are indeed registered.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to my first point with respect to the land management paradigm.  The  proposed merger of Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Property Registration Authority of Ireland, and the Valuation Office into Tailte &Eacute;ireann provides an opportunity for transformative change.  I welcome this committee's report of December 2021 on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill 2020, and in particular the two recommendations that the PSRA would be brought into the merger and that the associated data sets around the property price register would be brought into play.  I believe that these recommendations should be fully endorsed and are a welcome insertion and consideration.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague Mr. Reid, as I am conscious of not taking too much time.  I would welcome any questions from members in time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Murray O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>We are almost out of time, but I will let Mr. Reid go ahead with his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#D00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I will be brief and make just a handful of quick points.  I will do a quick edit of what I was going to say.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is used to housing crises, and we have been surviving in one for quite a period.  It is always the State that comes in and actually solves problems.  Since the State has been somewhat missing from housing production, as Mr. Reynolds also referred to earlier, we have developed a dysfunctional housing market.  House price inflation is in the past 30 years has been nothing short of excessive.  It is 2.6 times greater than the wage rate increases, and six times the rate of inflation in the past 30 years.  When we see this, we must ask why.  We are aware there are issues around construction, but the significant price factor is the price of land.<\/p> <p>  When we looking at the town centre first policy, we look at the development of community and the development of place.  Housing is one aspect of this.  Where we put the housing is critically important.  The committee is currently looking at the living over the shop approach.  A number of people have looked at this and they have all run away from it because it has been problematic.  It is problematic partly because of regulation and partly because of cost.  The value of living over the shop is not necessarily the quantum of development it would bring forward; it is also about what it does to the town centres particularly in rural area Ireland, and in creating a sense of vibrancy in city centres that die after 6 p.m.  We also have to look at these buildings because of the volume of embedded carbon in them.  It may be more expensive to do this, but we have already put the carbon in and we must also consider this.<\/p> <p>  There is a major shortage of accommodation, but going back to the issue of price structure, our young people can no longer afford housing, they cannot afford rent, and once this pandemic is over they will vote with their feet.  That will be very problematic for our society.  We have certainly seen this in rural Ireland when people have left and we have had depopulation.  We do not necessarily want to see this again.  The title of the Government policy is Housing For All, which is critically important.  It must, however, be done with equity and affordability as key elements of the delivery.  The late economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, said that sometimes what is called economics is very often what mirrors the need of the respectable affluent.  I do not think this is necessarily what we should have as a housing policy.  We did a lot of positive things around housing policy and we must continue that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Odran Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid for sticking to the time.

I thank each of the witnesses for giving us their time today.  It is very valuable to us.  As an Oireachtas joint committee, we look at housing generally, but today we are talking specifically about the renovation of existing built vacant and-or derelict properties, and we all understand the difference between those.  Housing for All identifies vacant properties and the restoration and renovation of them as the most sustainable way to increase housing stock.  It is not the only way to do so but it is certainly the most sustainable way.<\/p> <p>  My questions in this round are directed largely at the Department.  I will come back in at a later round if I can.  My first question for the Department is about Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe.  What are the specific targets for that?  Second, we are in a housing crisis, and we have a homelessness crisis and a climate emergency.  It is alarming the Department does not have accurate data on the number of vacant built homes that exist in the State.  What specific actions is the Department taking to capture that data accurately?  Is it relying on the Department of Finance and the local property tax exercise to capture those data?  From a Dublin city perspective, it is no mystery.  You can walk around any part of the city, and within 15 minutes to a half an hour, you can identify at least a dozen vacant or derelict properties or a combination of both.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions about the schemes already in place.  In a Dublin city context, Dublin City Council has had a vacant homes officer since 2017.  It has a one-stop shop.  It has actively promoted the living city initiative, which has been in operation since 2015.  However, there have only been 59 successful applications.  Mr. Reynolds referred to the figure of 4,000 dwellings.  Not all of them will fall into the living city initiative.  The figure of 59 is, by any standard, paltry.  Does the Department not think it has not worked?  As it is a tax credit, it requires people who own properties and who are not necessarily cash-rich to spend money in advance to benefit from a tax credit over a seven-year period.  It has not worked.  Has the Department considered a grant scheme?  The Department gives a direct grant for new-build affordable homes.  Would it not consider grant funding for the renovation of existing properties that are on streets and in communities where public lighting, sewerage services and public transportation are available?<\/p> <p>  Through the buy-to-rent scheme, local authorities can buy properties and rent them out for social housing.  I do not understand why local authorities are not allowed to count those properties they buy and rent to social housing tenants as part of their social housing targets.  Will the Department explain why that is the case?  Why would we not change that to incentivise local authorities by allowing them attribute them directly to their social housing targets?  Dublin City Council has no target for the repair and lease scheme.  I believe this is down to the fact that there is a &euro;60,000 cap on the scheme.  Has the Department looked at that and is it considering increasing that amount?  The financial cost of repairing a vacant property, particularly an old vacant property, is significant.  The economic and social reward of doing it is enormous.  It regenerates streets and communities and it adds back to those communities.<\/p> <p>  From my experience, the compulsory purchase order, CPO, process by a local authority can take ten years to complete, then it starts looking for funding, and there are all of the issues around that.  How does the Department propose to accelerate the CPO process and make it more effective?  Utilising vacant housing is the most sustainable way for us to increase the housing stock.  We need to do all the new builds, but to increase housing stock and regenerate these inner-city communities and rural towns, we need to prioritise this.  How will the Department do that under Housing for All?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#E00200","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>That was almost five minutes of questions so there are only about two minutes left to answer, but we can come back to answer them at the end.

The first question was about Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and the targets.  We see Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe as a mixture of sites that will be made available in the vicinity of towns and grants to refurbish vacant properties.  For all the reasons the Senator has outlined, it is important to refurbish properties in towns.  These must be for individuals to refurbish.<\/p> <p>  We have a target in the pathfinder scheme of 2,000 by 2025, but we will have to consider the take-up and how it progresses.  Similarly, there are about 2,500 for the CPO programme to bring properties to the market.  They are in tandem with the schemes that are under the social housing programme, working with approved housing bodies to see what they can bring forward.  The Senator specifically mentioned the existing schemes such as buy to rent and repair and lease.  The repair and lease grant has been increased and these are matters we keep under review.  Local authorities have produced delivery action plans that encompass everything they will do in social housing.  Under Housing for All, we are looking for action on all fronts, including the expansion of both the repair and lease and buy to let schemes.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the CPO process - I am probably skipping over a couple of things.  In the programme we have been talking about, bridging finance will be made available by the Housing Finance Agency so that there will be a funding package in place.  Work is under way by the Law Reform Commission because, as the Senator said, the legislation is very old and it takes a long time to go through it and, at this stage, it needs to be streamlined to recognise not only private property rights but the public good and the common good.  There is a need to streamline and progress it quickly.  We are waiting to see what the Law Reform Commission comes up with in that regard, and we are anxious to see this from a housing perspective.<\/p> <p>  The living city is a taxation measure and a relief that is given by the Minister for Finance.  The current scheme expires this year.  It is up to the Minister to consider the future direction of that.  In terms of Housing for All, we have focused on schemes such as Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe.  Money will also come from the URDF and ERDF.  We are working with regional assemblies on that to see where the gaps are in terms of dealing with vacancy and dereliction that need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt Ms Graham.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#E00500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":367,"content":"<p>I will respond later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":368,"content":"<p>I have no doubt there will be an opportunity to return to those questions towards the end of the meeting, or others may ask them as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#E00700","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Vallone, Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Reid and Ms Murray O'Connor for their presentations.

I am picking up from where Senator Fitzpatrick left off.  It is still completely unclear what Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe is.  I have read the Government's housing plan.  I have read the initial note for expressions of interest to interested parties.  I am looking for specific answers to specific questions.  It is not clear if Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe provides a subsidy to a developer, as is the case with the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, a grant aid to a buyer, or an equity stake similar to the affordable housing fund, for example.  We know it is intended to reduce the purchase price by 20%, which is in the region of &euro;60,000 to &euro;80,000 per property.  Has it been decided whether it is one of those three options?  If it is an equity stake, how will it be recouped?  If it is not an equity stake, will there be any mechanism for recouping the money such as in the affordable housing fund?<\/p> <p>  Ms Graham mentioned the targets, which was my other question.  I thank her for that.  Is there an indicative spending allocation over the period up to 2025?  We have that for other areas like the Land Development Agency, LDA.  Given that a large portion of this will be for new developments, is there a concern that the housing agency managing the scheme will be in direct competition with local authorities, approved housing bodies and the LDA for turnkeys or forward purchases because they will be chasing a similar number of units?<\/p><p>Likewise, if it is for vacant and obsolete units in cities and town centres, is there a concern that it would be in competition and the approved housing bodies, for example, for the buy and renew and repair and lease schemes?<\/p><p> My question relates to the overall target for vacant properties of 2,500 mentioned in the Government's housing plan.  Am I correct that this goes to 2025?  What was the basis for 2,500 units?  We know from GeoDirectory that there are up to 90,000 vacant properties.  Even if it is only half of that number, why is the target 2,500?  It seems to lack the ambition that many of our opening commentators suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#E00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

In cities, this was for build-to-sell apartments that would be produced at prices that people could purchase at in cities.  That was the segment of the market where particular action was required.  The targets that I gave are for towns rather than the cities fund.  As the Deputy described, that is new builds, new developments and work on that.

The matter relating to towns is dealing with vacant properties.  There are two different gaps in the market.  There is not a choice of private accommodation or homes, particularly in smaller towns.  Sites could be made available in proximity to towns.  There is clearly a large level of vacancy and dereliction in towns.  The data shows larger, more significant proportions of those on the western seaboard.  Many towns have suffered significantly from that.

It is an issue that I have been working on in my own area of Waterford for the last number of years.  We have been successful in Waterford in tackling the issue of vacancy and dereliction.  Ms Vallone mentioned in her contribution the benefits of a public-private collaborative approach to this issue.  That is what has worked well in Waterford.  The private sector has stepped up to the plate to purchase and renovate units, using schemes such as the repair and lease scheme.  The council has used the stick of the compulsory purchase order process, has carried out CPOs, and has heavily focused on the issue of buy and renew.  It is a collaborative approach.  Anyone who suggests that either the private or the public sector can do it on their own is misleading the public.  It is only by having that collaborative approach that we will achieve progress on this.<\/p> <p>  The repair and lease scheme has been instrumental in Waterford.  I have mentioned it several times previously.  It is a shame that 22 local authorities have delivered less than five units over the past four years under the repair and lease scheme.  Eight local authorities have not delivered a single unit.  My county has delivered nearly 50% of all repair and lease units.  It has had a tangible impact, with benefits for the streetscape, and it has provided much-needed one- and two-bed accommodation for individuals and families.  I have a question for Ms Graham .  When will the Department set specific targets for local authorities for the repair and lease scheme?  I know there are global figures and targets for leases that were in place, which we are phasing out.  The scheme has been proven to be successful.  The Department needs to provide ambitious targets for local authorities, otherwise we will not see the progress that we need.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the focus on the 2,500 CPOs.  Let us provide targets for individual local authorities for delivery under CPOs.  I appreciate that it can be a complex process and that the Department will underwrite a financial risk for local authorities, which is welcome.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of specific questions other than the one that I mentioned.  Is it intended that local authorities will be given a specific number of serviced sites under Cro&iacute; Conaithe?  For example, Waterford might have 100 serviced sites as a target, and it is up to the local authority to decide where it is most beneficial to have those serviced sites in villages or towns.  How will that be worked out?  Will it be done on a bid basis?<\/p><p> Mr. Reid spoke to the issue of living over the shop.  There is merit in having a repair and lease type scheme that will deliver units at below market rent, in other words, a cost rental type scheme to deliver units to the market that will compete with the private rental sector at, at least, 20% below market rents.  The 20% below market rent provision is already built into the repair and lease scheme.  Waterford has been successful in the delivery of social housing units in the city centre.  We need to be conscious of the need for mixed tenure development as well.  I would ask that consideration be given to such a pilot scheme in Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#F01900","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>The Senator's questions are directed to the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#G00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>In general terms, the Department is very open to any projects of that nature, social or affordable.

The delivery action plans that are being looked at now will look at the overall delivery in all of the schemes by local authorities.  We have issued to vacant homes officers an enhanced programme for full-time offices.  We looked at the role of the vacant home officer.

I want to cover one or two particular areas on which I would like general feedback from all of the witnesses appearing for us today.<\/p> <p>  I will start with land availability and compulsory purchase orders.  I was a councillor for many years before I was elected to the Seanad.  Last weekend, I was brought to a building in Enniskerry village which was the subject of an application by the HSE, possibly three or four years ago.  It is a derelict period property in the village of Enniskerry that one could not buy for &euro;2 million.  It is a stunning building which one passes on the way to Powerscourt Estate.  The planning application notice is still on the gate.  I photographed the building from the outside.  I also took a photograph of the notice, which I am happy to circulate after the meeting.<\/p> <p>  For me, this illustrated yet again the large tracts of property, land and buildings that are in the 31 local authority areas.  I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where there are substantial sites in the ownership of the council that are derelict, one of which I visited this morning.  This a major town centre zone that is highly suitable for residential purposes.  It is on a transport corridor and close to a harbour with the best amenities on the east coast, if not in the whole of Ireland.  It is served by brilliant services.  What is going on here in terms of State lands?  Land within the ownership of the Defence Forces are underutilised, as are lands and properties in the ownership of the HSE.  There are lands in the ownership of the educational authorities that are lying derelict, one of them in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and others in Dundrum and north County Dublin.  This is very substantial real estate.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is compulsory purchase orders and the local authorities' failure in that regard.  Local authorities tell me they do not have the money, resources or wherewithal.  I have a particular interest in this area.  I have dealt extensively with Ms Niamh Larkin, director of audit at assistant secretary general level in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, with whom our witnesses will be familiar.  This morning, I took the time to review a number of reports.  A constantly recurring issue in all of these reports is the property asset register and the failure of city and county managers to comply with a wide range of recommendations.  Today, the universities spoke about the requirement for the Land Registry and the registration of properties.  We have a serious problem with the registration, administration and management of properties, be they in the health services, the Prison Services, the Defence Forces and so on.  Some of the major culprits are the local authorities.  I have a list on my desk today in regard to Dublin City Council.  I am aware of issues in Wicklow County Council and Galway City and County Council.<\/p> <p>  How can we focus on and address the issue of derelict lands and substantial properties, some of which are protected structures and present their own challenges?  How do we get our State agencies to focus on the substantial properties that can be repurposed in terms of the rejuvenation of our villages and towns, urban and rural, and put to use for residential and other uses, thus revitalising our towns, villages and communities?

There are a couple of things to mention.  One is the specific statutory powers being given to the LDA and the TUD witnesses mentioned that.  The Property Registration Authority, PRA, has worked with them on that.  It will have to give a formal report to Government on State land banks.  That will be really important as one of the mechanisms for highlighting where that land availability is.  Part of the work in Housing for All is a whole tranche of more lands for the LDA to bring to fruition and the capacity under the LDA Act for it to work with local authorities on lands.<\/p> <p>  Another component of that is the residential zoned land tax.  Mr. Hogan has been working very closely with the Department of Finance and could give more details on that.  Again, that gives the transparency on land that is owned and what it is being used for and taxing it if its not being brought forward.  On property, part of the analysis of getting the data from the LPT is with a view to bringing in a vacant property tax.  Local authorities will equally be applied.  I recognise precisely what the Senator said but this issue has come up in a number of the reports of the auditors on this.  We equally realise many lands local authorities have go back for generations so the process of registration can be difficult.  I know as part of the social housing programme and the increased 10,000 build per annum, that land availability, what lands local authorities have, what they are going to be used for and how they might form part is a particular aspect the Department and the housing delivery office are looking at.  There are a number of strands to dealing with what is a really important issue.

I very much understand the issues currently prohibiting the restoration of our vacant properties, especially in our towns where one third of our population lives.  The combined cost of fire, access, protected structure status, insurance and professional fees leave restoration unviable for many of these properties.  On this, my first point and question relate to the limited planning exemptions that expired in December of last year.  According to the figures presented by Mr. Reynolds, the number of planning exemption notifications in 2020 was almost half the number of Part Vs nationally.  It also showed an upward trend in figures, which suggests planning exemptions work and that the fewer barriers placed in the planning application process, the more people will be incentivised to repurpose their vacant units.  It is great that there are plans to extend the planning exemptions to 2025 as part of the town centre first initiative.<\/p> <p>  My first question to the Department is whether consideration been given to simplifying the planning procurement further with one-stop shops to reduce the costs associated with change of use applications.  As Mr. Reid and Ms Murray O'Connor said in their statements, it is currently less expensive to leave them vacant as the returns, if any, are not worth the hassle.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the vacant property tax currently being developed.  I would be grateful if the Department could update us on the progress of that tax.

The committee will have a chance to look at that next month.  I did not mention our own manual on bringing back homes.  It tries to look at the exempt development, disabled access, fire certificates, other elements and what is needed for different houses to bring that together.  We see an important part of town centre first and making the vacant homes officers full-time is to enable local authorities to be resourced and have toolkits available to them so they can support people through the process.

I want to try to pull out some more solutions to it.  I do not think anybody here can say addressing vacant housing is going to be the panacea for the housing crisis but it is an important toolkit for us in that effort, particularly for bringing our towns and cities back to life.  With that in mind, I am quite interested in what Ms Vallone and Mr. Reid talked about.  Ms Vallone gave the example of other perspectives from other cities she has worked with and the benefits that accrued.  I have questions for her and the departmental officials.  We had people from Anois before us talking about dereliction in Cork and giving us examples of what happens in Amsterdam.  I ask Ms Vallone to give us some solutions by suggesting two measures the Department could implement that it could reasonably do.  What would they be?<\/p> <p>  I have a very similar question for Mr. Reid because he talked about regulation and costs being issues.  Are there any specific regulations he thinks are be easily identifiable and could be changed?  Where are the bulk of costs coming from?  I think Mr. Reynolds referenced that for a &euro;35,000 refit, approximately &euro;10,000 of that is planning fees.  I want to get a sense of whether there is any low-hanging fruit nobody is really noticing or doing anything about.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Department, and I may be springing this on the officials somewhat, but have they had any experience of other European neighbours that do not have the same problem with dereliction and that have brought their towns and cities back to life?

I will start with the lowest hanging fruit, as she mentioned.<\/p><p>There are some practical opportunities that, being a practitioner, I would suggest.  The first is having a vision or plan.  In Clonakilty, for example, we had a plan.  This would be a catalyst for any opportunity of funding before opportunities come, not only to react to when they come but to be prepared.  This vision is strategically important, not only as a catalyst for funding but also to inform and inspire the citizens.  We are building, with Cork County Council, a nurturing of stewardship with the community at every opportunity, for instance, in the colour scheme, the Christmas lighting and all of this wealth of activity that brings people to be interested in the town centre.<\/p><p> One important lowest hanging fruit is to stop doing things wrongly and stop the decay before we think too much of what to do.  Unfortunately, every day I see shopfronts being abused, neglected or transformed.  This is a big deal in our town centres.  For example, let us declutter everything before we start buying other things or furnish the town centre.  There is much unused street furniture: bollards, inappropriate street lighting and road marking.  This is very much a cost-effective opportunity to clean up the town centre.  Between having a vision and clean-up is starting to see what the opportunities are.  Even those vacant buildings come up into the conversations.  Maybe having some informative plans designed can stimulate attraction, not only from the point of view of a community but also investors, and an opportunity to re-function those buildings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Giulia Vallone","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I refer to two of the regulations, the fire and building regulations.

There is a cost in materials and in access and egress from shops that have been there for some time.<\/p> <p>  There is also something to be addressed with the owners of these premises.  There is a fear of change.  We have seen a number of places where people do not want anything to happen because it discommodes how they work and we have to overcome that.  Some of that work might be done by the local authority proactively working in areas.  The example of Carrickmacross was given earlier on.  It had a whole street worked on in a space in time.  That makes it cheaper.  That gives people the experience of how to do this.<\/p> <p>  On the skill levels involved in doing this, something that is not being mentioned is design.

It is no one's fault that we have this system.  We have three paper-based applications that have evolved in this way.  The difficulty for somebody who, for example, owns a building a Youghal that is a protected structure with two vacant upper floors that he or she wants to do something with, is not only does that person possibly have to complete a change of use application for planning, which has been dealt with in the exemption, but the requirement for a fire search and a disabled access search is triggered.  We also have building control amendment regulations, SI 9, our reinforced self-certification system that has been in place since 2014.<\/p> <p>  There is a difficulty with these three separate paper-based applications.  Planning was never a problem.  It is the most predictable of all the statutory processes to go through.  The difficulty for somebody undertaking a new lease, or a project like that, is that person will only know if he or she did not get it when he or she is nearly towards the end of the process.  A person can have planning, but all of a sudden that individual may not be able to get a disabled access route correctly in the building, or there may a requirement for a lift or some other requirement.  The manual on the repurposing of existing buildings that was mentioned is very good, but it does not deal with the technical issues we have.  We have 12 separate technical guidance documents and two secondary ones with approximately 600 pages of technical information.<\/p> <p>  For the person doing a scheme in a protected structure in a secondary town - Youghal is just an example - the rent will not be &euro;2,000 a month as it is in D&uacute;n Laoghaire but an awful lot less.  That person is looking at doing something with this protected structure; we have to make the it simpler.  Even if there is a streamlined process, the process I have just outlined is one where a person can go in and there is no diminution of standards whatsoever.  There might be a fire officer and the person queues up and goes with his or her drawings to that officer.  The first one would be planning.  If it is a conservation building, you go to the conservation officer, if you pass that you take your drawings to the fire officer and the last one would be the disabled access search.  If there is an issue with the width of a doorway in a protected structure, that conversation can be had behind the counter and, therefore, an individual is not dealing with a process in isolation.  Frequently, on that particular project I mentioned, which was a 35 sq. m ground floor change of use, the subconsultant who did the disabled access search had to do four separate layouts for two disabled toilets.  It is madness but that is because it is looked at in isolation.<\/p> <p>  If we were able to get all the building control and planning officers around a table to look at these simple applications, they could be resolved very easily.  It is a procedural thing.  My colleague, Eoin &Oacute; Cofaigh, who is an ex-president of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland involved in drafting a number of the technical guidance documents, has confirmed that no primary legislation whatsoever is required for a process like this.  This could be done in a series of two, or perhaps three, ministerial orders in the morning, if required.

This is an issue I am particularly interested in.  It has been a very good discussion.  On Ms Graham's contribution, I particularly welcome the circular that was sent around yesterday on the vacant homes officers and the progress that is being made to make sure that they are full time throughout the country.  It has been great to hear about the Italian experience from Ms Vallone, in addition to the experience in Clonakilty.  That input from Mr. Hogan on Flanders and Amsterdam is very useful.  I was quite taken by Mr. Reynolds's statistic of 40,000 dwellings when it comes to taking houses back into the housing stock and his figure of 4,000 relating to Dublin City Council.  We recently met with representatives of the council on this matter; I will get into that a little later.  Ms Murray O'Connor hit the nail on the head.  The information is not reliable and that is what we need in this sphere.  That is the critical first step because unless we measure and monitor the situation we will not be able to move the dial on it and make real progress.  That is something that we as politicians, across the political divide, want to achieve.  Mr. Reid made a very good point on the benefits of living above the shop, which does not just have a benefit in delivering a housing unit but also has a benefit for rural Ireland.  That is quite a striking point.<\/p> <p>  Housing for All is all about delivering 300,000 new homes over five years, but its primary focus is on new builds and vacancies within council stock.  Senator Cummins and I recently launched a discussion document on vacant properties outside of council stock.  We believe, as do most people on this call, that we can unlock additional homes through a drive that would reduce vacancy.  Our discussion document set out 26 actions that range from setting targets, as Senator Cummins alluded to, on repair and lease, build and renew, derelict sites and CPOs.  There have been two pieces of good news in the past week relating to vacancies.  First, the announcement by the Minister that there will be planning permission exemptions for people who want to turn a vacant or derelict site into a home and, as Ms Graham spoke about, the announcement that vacant homes officers will be full-time positions in each local authority area.<\/p> <p>  These are welcome developments, but we need to do more because all of us appreciate that it is just not right that houses lie idle in the middle of a housing crisis.  The big issue, as Ms Murray O'Connor so articulately explained, is the unreliability of the data.  The CSO and GeoDirectory are the two main data sources many of us use when it comes to vacant properties, but they have very different ranges in respect of categorising the problem.  They give figures of 42,000 right up to 92,000.  That is some difference so we need to get reliable statistics and we need to quantify the problem.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Reynolds spoke about the potential for 4,000 new homes in Dublin city centre, yet Dublin City Council representatives told the committee that it could only transform approximately 16 vacant or derelict units into homes.  It is very hard for us to hold them accountable when we do not have a reliable data source.  I have to say, and I said it at the time, that I just do not buy the figure of 16.  I am particularly interested in the figures cited by Mr. Reynolds and the research done by UCC and DCU.  I would love him to take a minute to elaborate on those.<\/p> <p>  All Ms Vallone's talk of decluttering and the joy she is bringing to Clonakilty makes her sound like Marie Kondo, but I am a big believer in not reinventing the wheel, taking best practice that has worked elsewhere and adapting it to the needs of other areas.  I would be very interested in hearing her top three nuggets that she thinks we could do quickly, whether that be things she learned from Cork or Italy.  Mr. Hogan interjected to recount the experience from Flanders with its regeneration projects.  He also spoke about Amsterdam.  I would love if he took a minute to talk to us about the top nuggets he feels we could implement.<\/p><p>Ms Graham spoke clearly about targets.  I support my colleague, Senator Cummins, and ask that targets are set for schemes such as repair and leasing and build and repair.<\/p><p> I will summarise my questions.  Will Mr. Reynolds talk us quickly through the stats he is using?  Will Ms Vallone talk us through the top three tips from Clonakilty or Italy?  If there is a top three things Mr. Hogan thinks we could lift from Flanders or the Amsterdam playbook and shift quite quickly into Ireland, I would love to hear about it.  Will Ms Graham reiterate the commitment to coming back to us on targets for vacancy, repair and lease and build and repair schemes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#K01200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>We have about three minutes left in this slot.

The UCC study is really good.  It is about 52 pages long and was done in 2018.  It was a really detailed planning study of an area that the committee is saying needs to be done across the board.  It is well worth having a look at.  William Brady did it.  The authors did a very detailed analysis of a city centre street.  They found that more people were living over shops than they had thought but that by targeting existing vacant infill sites and upper floors, they could increase the capacity of that street by 280%.  Interestingly, they found that something like 70% of all the vacant units were owned by one person, which meant that activating the CPO nudge process was a lot easier.  Second is the desktop internal study Dublin City Council did.  I was chatting to one of the senior planners at the time at a conference on vacant housing and they reckoned that in Dublin city, within the canals, there was capacity for 4,000 apartments without building one new structure.  As we know, all you have to do is look up in any street in any town and you will see we have the capacity.  Pretty much the entire Airbnb component in Dublin could be distilled into the existing upper floors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mel Reynolds"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Wow.

There are a lot of points of learning in answer to Deputy Higgins's contribution.  I will speak briefly about what I have learned from the process in Clonakilty.  We have already applied for the case study.  The Deputy will probably have seen the application for Cobh as well.  It is almost like very practical guidance.  It is called a visual audit.  We need to understand first of all how we might have a big, impactful intervention in what we do rather than, as is said in Ireland, spreading the butter too thin.  We need to concentrate on a more compact area and do something that really makes a transformation.  The urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, is already teaching us that we need to have transformation.  I would start with a visual audit.  I could meet the Deputy and go on a walkabout with the residents and councillors to see what is wrong.  It would be very easy.  Some people, when they live in an area, do not get this, but there can be a lot of disused road signage, bollards and so on at every corner of a town centre that have probably been there for a long time and that do not need to be there any more.  Their removal brings with it an interest from the citizen to improve the area.  It is a collaboration.  While as an architect I could very easily have a vision in the form of a drawing of a town centre, in local authorities, as members will be aware, there are a lot of funding streams and most of them are for roads and sewerage.  They are very much for engineering infrastructure.  I work in the engineering department of Cork County Council.  I am not a county architect but I am a senior architect in that department.  I can activate outcomes for communities, including any roads project.  Every day there is a local engineer working inside the architectural conservation area, ACA, inside the town centre, but he has the same scope to do that project outside the town centre.  The thing is, if I am working with him, I can make the public space out of roads funding.  We did that in Clonakilty.  We built the streetscape with the drainage funding and built the third phase of the scheme with the OPW funding.  I have a list of examples that could be applicable to other towns.  It is a collaboration, working together, on a vision-led plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Giulia Vallone"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>We are just up to eight and a half minutes in this slot, so I am sorry, Deputy Higgins, but I have to move on.

There is no one in the Department working on an estimated 92,000 or 90,000 vacant properties.  We do not have a team.  We should have a team in the Department driving this.  Mr. O'Sullivan made a point about having only three full-time vacant home officers in all 31 local authorities.  This is my second year as a Deputy but I was a councillor for 12 years.  For 12 years I and other Sinn F&eacute;in councillors were beating this drum.  This morning, as I came to the train station to come up here, I passed properties that have been derelict and vacant for some time.  There is a difference between dereliction and vacancy.  The chances are that vacant properties can be turned around much more quickly and actually turned into housing or community hubs, whereas derelict properties need a lot of work.  This morning I passed various properties that have been derelict and vacant for over 20 years, some 30 years.  Ten years ago I walked through these areas with the then Cork City Council manager, and ten years later I drive through those areas and am astounded that today we have no one in the Department working solely on this.  What I would say to the Department and the Minister, and it is a message that should come out loud and clear from this committee, is that there should be a section put aside to deal with dereliction and vacancy to ensure that the local authorities are doing their job.  This is not aimed at Mr. O'Sullivan; it is aimed at Government policy and the Ministers involved.  Mr. O'Sullivan is trying to do ten jobs, and that is not fair on him or other people in the Department.  We need someone to deal with this as a stand-alone issue.  We know ourselves that if we are to solve the housing crisis, dereliction and vacant properties and turning them into homes will not solve the crisis but will play a part.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the damage that dereliction does to the communities I represent.  There are five schools in one of the areas I represent that is blighted by dereliction and vacancy.  No one seems to give a damn.  Let us call a spade a spade.  The Department has done nothing to assure local authorities.  We have a derelict sites levy that is not being collected by local authorities.  Some local authorities are not even applying it and other local authorities are not collecting it, and the Department is doing nothing.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the derelict sites levy and why it is not being collected.  Has a decision been taken at Government, Department or local authority level not to collect it?  If not, why is the Department not driving local authorities to do what they are legally supposed to be doing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#L01200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Is that question for Ms Graham?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#L01250","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#L01275","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>If I may come back in initially, I will let Ms Graham in afterwards.

That is probably quite controversial for some people, and it is not that I am against people with disabilities, but sometimes we must look at what we have in terms of the cost and the capacity to be able to do some of this stuff.  Likewise, if one has universal design in the buildings, one does not have it on the footpaths outside, as you quite rightly said.  It can be a very alien environment for people.  The real difficulty with this is that sometimes in some of the places we want to put people in terms of creating a dynamic, particularly in a city area, there are noise levels at night.

It uses a standardised set of assumptions so when one is comparing Ireland with the UK or the Netherlands, one is comparing apples with apples.  I would go with its definitions of a derelict property and a vacant property.  A derelict property is probably one where the ESB has been disconnected, it has been unoccupied for at least two years and it is uninhabitable, whereas a vacant property, and the fair deal scheme incentivises vacancy in many cases, is one that is habitable, it is probably connected, but there is nobody living in it at that time.

It is a totally different data set and one cannot compare geodata figures related to vacancy with those of a different jurisdiction because there are different assumptions underpinning them.  It would be well worthwhile for the committee to invite somebody from the CSO to go through the assumptions the CSO makes.  They are very rigorous.  I went through this in 2017 when I was interrogating the figures being produced by the Department for new housing, which were subsequently passed by the then Minister, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, to the CSO to audit.

Urban regeneration is incredibly important for the delivery of housing, which I previously referenced.  One of the great lessons from the 1960s and 1970s is that community facilities and the physical infrastructure of communities did not always follow through.  One of the concerns I have with Housing for All, both for existing and new communities, is that the supply of housing will happen but it is not clear that we will be able to fund and prioritise community facilities in those areas.  I ask Ms Graham to outline how the Department intends to do that in two places, namely greenfield sites where we are effectively building new towns and in traditional communities.  The latter are really concerned about new houses coming on stream.  In Santry, for example, a lot of residents are very fearful that there will be an increase in housing supply but that they will not necessarily get new community facilities to match that.  I use the term \"community facilities\" in its broadest sense to include schools, health centres and community resources like halls and so on.  How will the Department use that element of urban regeneration to match the housing supply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#O00100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>There are three different components.

One is when land is newly zoned and the other is for designated areas.  Designated areas are particularly targeted as being brownfield areas, the sort of places that one might identify in places like Finglas, where there are a large number of vacant brownfield-type buildings that are suitable for redevelopment.  The problem has always been when we get the development we do not always get the community facilities, as the Deputy said.  There is a need to better target that on behalf of the community and to identify, as part of the overall planning process for that designated area, what will be required and then to determine what is a fair proportion split between the State, the developer and the local authority.  We do need to move that on and land value sharing is a mechanism to do that.  We have published the heads of a Bill that we are doing some further economic appraisal on and that will be refined and brought back as a firm proposal to Government later this year.  In principle, at the point of zoning for newly zoned land or at the point of designation, we establish existing use, which involves quite extensive surveying and assessment of the land value and then at a later point in the process, when value is established on the land, we identify the difference.

One of the knock-ons from developing this legislation will be addressing the current levy system and how that will interact with both the zoned land tax that is coming in and the new designation that I have talked about.

I suggest that people familiarise themselves with the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy 2018-2021, which was published in 2018.  In May 2020, its report pointed to 420 vacant properties being purchased from financial institutions by local authorities, 62 purchased for sale, 161 homes being delivered through repair and lease and 545 homes being delivered through build and repair.  Of course, these statistics are, thankfully, out of date and we now know that more than 1,000 homes have been delivered through repair and lease and build and repair alone and what we want to see is more of that.  That is why we are championing the need for local authorities to be given targets so that they deliver more homes through these mechanisms.  That is what we are asking for cross-party support on.<\/p><p>To come in here and say that there is no strategy, nobody is working on this, there is no budget and nothing is being done is a bit disingenuous.  Admittedly, more needs to be done and that is why Senator Cummins and I have been advocating for targets to be set in this field.  We ran out of time during my previous contribution but I would love to hear Ms Graham give a commitment to come back to the committee on whether targets relating to vacancy, repair and lease and build and repair can be set.

Our social housing people are very conscious of the need for flexibility and many of these schemes are dependent on people coming forward with them.  They want to ensure they maximise their social housing numbers and they do not want the target to be something that is not met for that reason.  That said, I will reflect on the points the Deputy has made.

The answers are not necessarily only found in European countries or elsewhere, as we know many of them ourselves.  A good document was prepared by our colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  They undertook a pilot town centre living initiative a couple of years ago and published a synthesis report.  The lessons are universal.<\/p> <p>  Many people have mentioned data, but we should not be looking at data from a top-down national statistic level only.  What really matters is data at local level.  Regional assemblies are now looking at towns in their jurisdictions.  That will be critical for targeting areas where there are concentrations of vacancies and derelicts.  It comes down to people on the ground surveying the floors of individual units, understanding what is happening in their towns and doing that work alongside the key stakeholders, those being people who care about the issue and are empowered to do something about it.  The most basic element of planning is survey analysis.<\/p> <p>  A second point is incentives.  No matter where it is, people have to want to refurbish properties because doing so costs more.  They may need support.  It is a common occurrence elsewhere.  One of the reasons we are so interested in European examples is because we share the fairness and proportionality test of state aid.  If money is being given to people to do something, it has to be for a significant public policy purpose.  Why is it that, in the counties most affected by vacancies and dereliction, three quarters of the new houses built in the past ten years were outside urban settlements and largely one-off individual houses?  People are voting with their feet for various reasons: living in urban settlements is expensive, cultural reasons and the overall environment.  We are doing a great deal to tackle these issues through, for example, the Town Centre First policy and many of the funding schemes that have been mentioned, including the rural development fund, RDF, and the urban fund.  That combined &euro;3 billion commitment is the largest regeneration scheme in the history of the State.  From the public perspective, it is bigger than the 20 years we had of urban regeneration.<\/p> <p>  A third point is co-ordination.  I get the need for streamlining and co-ordination and the fact that processes need to be easier.  Incentivisation is a part of that.  However, it cannot be just as simple as making decisions over a counter.  Something that will probably be reflected in Town Centre First is the need for someone to draw things together, interpret for people and explain it to them.  Ms Vallone does that in Cork.  The architectural professional is well placed to lead in this regard, but I would not view it as being exclusively the preserve of architects.  There are people involved in community development as well as planners who, if lifted from regulatory burdens, would be equally skilled at leading urban regeneration.  I am referring to people who are passionate and committed, have vision and can communicate that vision in order to do something to address the complex problems involved, using the tools that we are now giving them.  It is the idea of drawing things together for people and co-ordinating in many different ways.<\/p> <p>  These three lessons are universal across European projects as much as they are across Irish ones.

It is about doing it in a more streamlined fashion and integrating the different regulatory streams.  A version of this was developed in the Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018, which was legislation from the Opposition that had all-party support on Second Stage in 2018.  Therefore, this is not changing our standards or making them any less onerous.  It is concern with making it easier for people to undertake regularised developments.  A regulatory system that is difficult and expensive to negotiate will encourage people to just carry out unauthorised developments, as Mr. Hogan mentioned.<\/p> <p>  What is being done here is to make it cheaper and easier to negotiate the process.  It will bring people in and encourage them to do this properly.  Any streamlined system like this process must be accompanied by much simpler technical guidance documents as well.  It is no use having a simplified system or incentives in place if people are being referred to 12 or 14 technical guidance documents, many of which will not be relevant and which are 600 pages long.  In a situation where a proposal concerns a modest building, for example, it is not going to happen if there is a requirement for a lift.  Equally, if there is a requirement for balconies or private open spaces off each dwelling, then it is not going to happen either.  Energy and conservation are the two areas in which my professional expertise lies.  These areas must be looked at in practical terms.  As Mr. Reid said earlier, at a certain point we must compromise and consider what we can live with in this regard.  Perfection is the enemy of progress, so we must get people in these structures, make them save, concentrate on comfort and get those buildings up to modern standards as best we can.  Otherwise, it is simply just not going to happen.<\/p> <p>  Presented with a proposal by an owner for a change in use for an existing building, most of my colleagues will say he or she should not bother.  It will either not be possible to get a fire safety certificate or a disabled access certificate.  It might be possible to get planning permission for the change, but the project will be nobbled somewhere.  No additional warranties are issued which incur additional risk in Northern Ireland in the context of building control compared with down here.  It is just that the processes are different.  Therefore, we can do the same thing and implement the same standards in a much simpler way without any additional risk to our local authorities.  This is a proposal that should be looked at.  We can put in as many incentives or taxes as we want, but we must also make it easier for people to undertake these projects.<\/p> <p>  The planning exemption concept is interesting.  There is a detailed breakdown of the figures in this regard for three years in the appendix of the document I submitted.  The interesting aspect was that it was undertaken across several local authorities.  The numbers in this context are modest now, but it can be imagined that this will happen in an organic way in many towns and cities.

To be clear, I think it is the view of all the members of the committee that there should be no reduction in any standards concerning fire safety or accessibility in protected structures or in the planning guidelines in that regard.

For example,  the easiest and cheapest way to transform a town is planting trees but the challenges behind doing that are enormous.

That is a deep dive into what is required from a multidisciplinary perspective in local authorities.  It may show, as the Deputy suggests, that in large counties more people are required and there may be different requirements and levels for different counties.  That work is being initiated with the City and County Management Association, CCMA, because one of the commitments in Housing for All is that local authorities are appropriately resourced to deliver on the objectives.

Economics is probably one.  We saw the sharp price inflation outside Dublin last year.  It is actually really positive in that it has to pay people to have a look at the upper floors.  Back in 2017, Dr. Lorcan Sirr outlined that some local authorities had rate rebates for vacant upper floors, so there was incentivisation.  A certain amount of dereliction is involved in the normal property cycle, whereby people are assembling sites.  The Deputy touched on some of the issues.  If there is a &euro;3 billion fund, one needs to have full-time staff administering it.  Full-time staff in local authorities are also needed.  Let us consider the sorts of detailed studies we are talking about, whereby we examine streets and devise strategies for them.  We carry out door-by-door surveys.  The North Main Street study carried out by University College Cork in 2018 involved this type of exercise.  It came up with some really interesting findings.  It takes manpower, however.  On the one hand, one cannot expect something to happen if one does not have the manpower behind it.  There is a combination of regulatory barriers.  It is difficult; our processes are very lumpy at the moment.  We need a mixture of carrots and sticks.  Incentives are needed.  Our local authorities need to step up.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out that some local authorities are doing really well.  Waterford local authority was mentioned earlier.  It has done really good work through the repair and lease scheme.  Louth County Council has done really good work on CPOs and bringing back existing derelict and vacant properties for social housing.  The Limerick regeneration project is knocking the ball out of the park when it comes to really good urban design-led initiatives.  It is carrying out surgical interventions on the urban fabric.  We probably need to determine the local authorities that are doing well, what they are doing and the staff they have.<\/p> <p>  On the question regarding architects involved in local authorities, a design professional is needed.  The process has to be design-led.  The local authorities have a serious role to play in this regard.  A number of things need to happen here in terms of policy, but the space available for residential use is considerable.  Every city and town has it, as one will see if one just looks overhead.  <\/p> <p>  Cost was mentioned as a barrier.  Approximately three years ago, D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council carried out an EnerPHit passive-standard retrofit of semi-derelict social housing in Rochestown Avenue.  It brought more than 30 units back into use.  The all-in cost to bring them up to the passive standard was less than &euro;100,000 per unit.  Retrofits can be carried out a lot more quickly than other projects.  The buildings are already serviced.  Retrofits have all the benefits that Mr. Reid and others mentioned regarding bringing towns and cities back into active service.  Retrofitting can be done very quickly and cost-effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2022012500002#S00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mel Reynolds"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I completely agree.<\/p> <p>  Ms Vallone mentioned studies that involved walking around to see the issues in areas.

More auditing is required.  There is an opportunity to ask all the members what is meant by a town centre.  It means something different in each local authority because it relates to the local area plan.  Why do we not consider architectural conservation areas, identifying the solid cores of town centres and delineating them through strong visual and material differences, almost by creating a threshold?  In Italy, you know immediately when you are in the town centre because there are paving stones and beautiful lights.  Why do we not try to start small?  Rather than spreading funds, let us concentrate on small areas and see what happens in terms of proper design standards and design codes.<\/p> <p>  It is a matter of public participation and educational and visual-awareness programmes.

Between 25% and 45% of new build supply in any given year involve people who are just doing it themselves.  Frequently, they get the sites themselves, battle to get planning to build in certain areas and so on.  We should ask whether we can get some of those self-builders building over shops, create a situation where there is a vacant upper floor space and all the statutory permissions are in place, and those units are sold to prospective owners for them to do the work themselves or employ builders to do it.  If the processes are simplified and it is made less difficult to do what we need to do, we do not have to look that far.  Northern Ireland does it.

This has been the third meeting on this topic.  The committee will now try to put together a report on the matter.  We have had a fascinating nine hours of discussion with a broad range of experts.  I studied planning years ago, like many people here, and living over the shops was talked about in the 1990s and the 2000s, but I think there is a real resurgence of the idea and a real need for it now.  We have looked at what has happened during the Covid pandemic with working from home and the realisation that our towns and villages are now a lot more to us than just somewhere from where we commute and where we spend a few hours at the weekend.  With digitisation, I think we will see more opportunity for people to work from home, at work clubs, etc.  That brings that local economic benefit as well.<\/p> <p>  Of course, housing needs have to underpin all we have discussed.  The collaborative town centre health checks are key to that.  It is a matter of collaboration in order that it does not become the local authority's plan or the planner's plan but is a collective stakeholder involvement such that it is our town or village and this is how we want to see it develop, assisted by the Department and the local authorities.  I believe the local authorities and the Departments want to assist and see the value in this.  Having the county architects there will be key to that and to string all these different policies and visions together.  There needs to be that mix of incentives and penalties in place to stimulate this, to move it along and to make it easy for people because people inherently know what they want in their town or village and know what they want to do in it.<\/p> <p>  I look forward to the committee report.
