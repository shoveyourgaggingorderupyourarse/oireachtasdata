I am pleased, therefore, to introduce the following draft order to this committee - the Technological Universities Act 2018 (Section 36) (Appointed Day) Order 2022.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, an appointed day for the establishment of a technological university, TU, and its name in both English and Irish shall be made by order.  The order must be approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to discuss the matter today in committee.  I wish to set 1 April 2022 as the appointed day for the establishment of the new technological university to be known as Atlantic Technological University in the English language and Ollscoil Teicneola&iacute;ochta an Atlantaigh in the Irish language and for the dissolution of Galway-Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny institutes of technology.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of a fourth technological university in the State is another important milestone for higher education in Ireland, in particular for the west and north west regions.  The new TU will provide a multi-campus university presence across the region encompassing eight locations in Castlebar, Galway city, Killybegs, Letterfrack, Letterkenny, Mountbellew and Sligo.<\/p><p>This new technological university will increase higher education access, drive enhanced regional development and increase opportunities for students, staff, business and enterprise, as well as local communities.  The new higher education institution of increased scale and reach will benefit students and communities right across Connacht and Ulster.  I very much look forward to this new TU bringing those benefits to people in the region, from its most westerly point to its most northerly, and all points between including in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Roscommon.  The new TU will now take its rightful place in the higher education landscape in an important strategic part of the country, bordering as it will both the Atlantic and Northern Ireland.  Its establishment will allow people in the furthest-flung corner of the island obtain, through digital connectivity, a university degree in their home places.  I am delighted to see this milestone being reached and I want to congratulate all involved.<\/p><p> The Government has a clear ambition to create a series of interlinked higher education institutions of greater capacity and reach across all regions of the country in order to help deliver on key national strategic objectives.  TUs are a key component in this strategic approach.  They provide increased reach, international recognition, greater research capacity, foreign direct investment, FDI, attraction, skills retention and creation, regional development, enhanced staff and student experiences and opportunities and advanced socioeconomic progression.<\/p><p> From April, the new Atlantic Technological University will start its journey and drive the agendas of higher education access, excellence in teaching and learning, regional development, research-informed educational provision and strengthened linkages with industry and the community.<\/p><p> We all want to ensure prosperity for this generation, which is so affected already by the Covid-19 phenomenon, and for future generations.  We want to ensure they have the foundational skill sets and qualifications to compete and succeed in a hugely altering and highly competitive world.  I thank all concerned, including the staff and students of the Institute of Technology Sligo, IT Sligo, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, a wide variety of stakeholders in the west and north west, the international advisory panel, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, QQI, and the Department.  All the aforementioned bodies and people played a key role, statutory and non-statutory, in getting the fledgling new university to this point of establishment.  I also thank Deputies and Senators for their kind attention today and thank all Members across the Oireachtas for their steadfast support for this hugely important higher education project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#B00200","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am pleased to be discussing the technological universities again, as we have done so many times before.  The Minister of State knows I have a particular interest in the Atlantic Technological University and I think it is a great name for it.  As he is aware, it is also important, that we have a proper sustainable funding model and we will have an opportunity to do that when the Cassells report comes back.  I ask that he speak to that.  We are expecting both the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to appear before the committee on 10 February.  It is very important we have that published as soon as possible in order that we can get the funding model right because unless we get that model right for the technological universities, they will not fulfil their potential.  The expectation along the Atlantic economic corridor is that this will be a real catalyst for change in terms of what it can provide in respect of developments in renewable energy and research and development on that.<\/p> <p>  When we look at research and development, we know the technological universities have not fulfilled their potential and we need to look at what they need in order to be able to do so.<\/p><p>We know those in Waterford, Cork and Dublin have probably been the best performers but only 0.2% of Ireland's total, or &euro;1.9 million, has been drawn down by the combination of the Atlantic Technological University.  Particularly in terms of the challenges of climate change and what we can do in regard to renewable energy along the western seaboard, it is important we have those proper discussions on the funding they need to be able to lever the huge amount of money that is available through Horizon 2020.<br\/><br\/>We know that since 2014, Ireland has drawn down more than &euro;1 billion worth of research funding, &euro;618 million of which was by the third level institutions.  We must really concentrate on what we need to do in that regard.  How will the Minister of State make sure that happens?<br\/><br\/>I am concerned about the public private partnership, PPP, contracts for all of the investments in technological universities, particularly as we have not carried out a proper evaluation of the couple that have been done before.  I believe it is approximately ten years ago since they were done under Fianna F&aacute;il.  We need to do a further examination of that model to see if we are going to deliver value for money and whether it is the best vehicle.  I do not believe it is the best vehicle for us to achieve what we need around third level.  I am concerned that we will end up with a privatised situation where the academic element will be public but many of the ways in which we deliver third level education will be dependent on the public private partnership.  I want to see the evidence for that.  One contract that was signed in 2020 was valued at almost &euro;600 million.  We are talking about an awful lot of money here.<br\/><br\/>This is quite technical but with regard to the amalgamation of St. Angela's College with the Atlantic Technological University, amendments will needed to the higher education authority Bill.  They need to be <i>in situ<\/i>before 1 April, however.  What does the Minister of State have in place to ensure that St. Angela's College can avail of what is on offer and amalgamate?<br\/><br\/>I want to acknowledge the huge amount of work that has been done by St. Angela's College, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, Institute of Technology Sligo, Letterkenny Institute of Technology and all the institutes in getting this to where it is today.  I want to make sure we do not let the ball drop in any of those instances.  I thank the Minister of State.

The experience that Scotland seems to have had is that some of the reforms it would have liked to have seen, both in the curriculum and changes in teaching in the classroom, including the encouragement of 21st-century skills, have not developed as much as they would have liked.  Some of the international writing on this suggests that unless the assessment model is aligned with the curriculum and the pedagogical approach, then the sort of reform that we would like to see does not carry through effectively.  We need to think creatively about how we approach things like assessment.  In more recent years we have seen, either with new subjects or updated specifications to existing subjects, other assessment models coming in which would be regarded as more equitable because it is a different way to demonstrate skills and other competences beyond the traditional sit-down written examination.  We need, however, to think about both new subjects and about looking at existing subjects.  In the case of some of the large ones that all students take, such as English or maths, there is nothing beyond the written papers at present.  Everyone is effectively sitting those exams.  We need to think about whether there are ways to develop other ways to demonstrate skills.  That would be a more equitable system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Obviously the challenge for us in all of the committee's discussions is that they will make a difference and that the changes that are suggested across the board and agreed will be implemented.

Through a series of guidance through 2020 and 2021, therefore, we directed schools in the types of supports they could provide in terms of resources, work that students could have done at home or indeed, in a synchronous or asynchronous capacity, how schools could engage with ensuring that students continued with their learning during that period.<\/p> <p>  For schools, we obviously had teachers who were specialists at post primary.

This is at every level and for every child.  It would not be specific to those with special needs or those at risk of disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  At early years, for example, we have the concept of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, as a learning area.  Digital skill development within the early childhood sector would be supported in that concept.  In terms of primary then, we have the revised primary language curriculum, which promotes digital literacy as an important aspect of children's learning and aims to supports children's abilities to engage with technology to acquire, comprehend and communicate knowledge in a variety of contexts.  A key aspect of the revised curriculum is the development of digital literacy and the child's ability to select, locate and critically analyse relevant information in multiple modes.<\/p> <p>  We have the primary maths curriculum development, which is ongoing.<\/p><p>Part of that takes account of developments in digital technology.  Specifically, it points to the potential technology affords in bringing real world applications to life in the classroom, helping to deepen mathematical understanding and connect mathematical learning to the real world.  <\/p><p>The primary curriculum framework outlines that being a digital learner is one of seven key competencies.  The key competencies play a significant and central role in children's learning as they are intended to be embedded across all curriculum areas and subjects from junior infants to sixth class through the learning outcomes.  The competency of being a digital learner seeks to support children to become curious, creative, confident and critical users of digital technology.  <\/p><p> The framework for junior cycle includes a set of 24 statements of learning which are central to the student experience in junior cycle.  Statement No. 24 focuses explicitly on digital technology.  The framework for junior cycle 2015 sets out eight key skills which support student learning across the curriculum.  The key skills are embedded in the learning outcomes within each junior cycle subject and short course and they include a focus on the four Cs of communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.  The junior cycle also provides students with opportunities to undertake specific digital short courses in digital media literacy and coding.  <\/p><p> At senior cycle, the NCCA has recently conducted a review of senior cycle which involved an extensive process of research and consultation and provided insights into the importance of digital skills for all school leavers.  The current senior cycle curriculum supports the development of digital skills in a variety of ways across the four programmes offered, including transition year, the leaving certificate vocational and applied programmes and the  leaving certificate established.

One of those opportunities is something we have touched on already, namely, the provision of different sorts of diversity of opportunities for students to be able to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and competencies.  That would be helpful, if we could achieve it.  Other countries and other systems have managed to do that.  As I mentioned earlier, for some of the newer subjects and in updating the specifications of existing subjects, we have sought to try to bring in other forms of assessment, including digital assessment.  We can leverage that more while still ensuring fairness.  We have to ensure that there is fairness, accessibility, equity and so on.  That is one real opportunity.<\/p> <p>  Sticking with the assessment piece, a second opportunity is around spreading the assessment load.  I spoke earlier about the stress that students face, and in terms of feeling that all of their eggs are in the one basket of a written examination in June.  We could consider opportunities that would help to alleviate that.  This happens to some extent already in the context of music orals and practicals, and other forms of practicals, which happen at times other than in June.  There are elements of that within our existing system, but there may be ways to enhance that further and to spread the load such that students would not face a lot of high stake things coming all at the one time.  <\/p> <p>  A further opportunity outside of assessment is, perhaps, integration.  We have a number of programmes at the moment.  We have the leaving certificate established, which the vast majority of students undertake.  We also have the vocational programme, which has really good modules and practical things such as enterprise education and the world of work.  Yet, students have to do the LCVP in order to access those.  We also have the leaving certificate applied, which we feel is a strong programme and a very successful programme but it sometimes denies opportunities for students pursuing that programme to do other things in leaving certificate established.  There are also issues about progression around LCA as well.  It is about finding ways through which it would be more student-centred so that students would be able to find ways to get access to things and that we do not have barriers put up necessarily to the sort of experiences that they can get access to.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tattan.

It is important teachers have the skills to be able to take on that work.  We heard from previous contributors to the committee about surveys undertaken in respect of which there were approximately 2,000 respondents and which showed that up to one third of teachers felt that for the students involved their contribution and assessment was really important.

When looking at reform of the leaving certificate and bringing in more practical aspects to the course load, the workload, the orals and so on we might, perhaps, look at developing the student's practical side as well as the theory and academic side, given we are considering listing the apprenticeships and further and higher education courses on the CAO form and promoting other forms or pathways of obtaining a qualification.<\/p><p>Perhaps somebody involved in policy or the curriculum might wish to speak to that.

We currently completely rely on external assessment with events.  Somebody goes in to sit an examination or for an oral or practical examination.  More continuous assessment would almost necessarily involve school-based involvement at some level, with teachers potentially being more involved in assessing students in some way.  Other systems have that approach.  There is a high level of trust in the leaving certificate and its reliability, since it is external, anonymous and so on.  It is not that we should not be thinking about this.  We should be thinking about it, but there are implications to it and other systems are prepared to go down routes like this, potentially with external moderation to ensure fairness.  It would be a marked change of approach to the current approach.  We would have to think carefully about how we would properly support teachers to do that in a way that would work for them and for students.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about encouraging the practical side of things.  Going back to the experience of secondary education in Ireland, we want, as far as we can, to properly equip students for the next stage of their lives, whether that is higher education, further education and training, apprenticeships, work, or whatever they choose to do.

Obviously some of that work lies with the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, but there is a role for the Department of Education as well.  The other major themes relate to continuous assessment and spreading the pressure of the terminal exam across a greater period.  For example, under the system in Britain and in the North, students build their grades continuously over the course of three years between their GCSEs, AS levels and A levels.

The sort of scenario the Deputy has painted is one that would certainly have the potential to help students in alleviating some of the stress.  However, a couple of things strike me that mean we have to think carefully about it.  One issue is that a very modularised experience might not be as positive for students.  For example, we could decide that the oral examinations should happen at the end of fifth year.  Nobody would think that a good idea because a major part of the experience of pursuing a language subject could potentially fall away at a very early stage.  That does not mean there are not some aspects we could do earlier in the two-year cycle and that could potentially include things in fifth year if we thought that was appropriate.  An argument is often made, quite rightly, that spreading these assessment events out ought to reduce the stress levels but there is a risk if there are a lot of them, or if we start to introduce lots of different assessment components across the range of subjects, that students could be hitting assessment events on a regular basis.  That could impact on what is happening in the classroom as they would not be able to see beyond the next practical, the next project or whatever it might be.

There is also an international dimension to the reflection there has been in the past two years so we can truly understand the various opportunities that might be available to us.  Equally, the relationship the Deputy mentioned between teachers and students was a feature of the contributions from teacher and school representatives at the meeting of the advisory group last week.

A lot of concerns have been raised on the T1 and T2 Irish language proposals.  It seems quite apparent that there is a problem in creating a subject that carries equal weighting and is more challenging without providing any real incentive.  On a theoretical basis I have no objection to having a more challenging course for native speakers and advanced learners of Irish but if there is no obvious incentive for schools to take it up I am not sure they will do so.  There are options.  It could be an additional subject in the same way that applied mathematics is or there could be bonus points but if there is no incentive I do not see why a school, even in Conamara or Corca Dhuibhne, would take it up.  A lot of schools and parents would be reluctant if students have a better chance of achieving full marks in the other subject.  There is a bit of a problem there so I ask the witnesses to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  As I have this opportunity I will make the following point to the officials from the Department.  Sometimes when we talk about the leaving certificate, we talk about the inequalities that exist but we all know that educational disadvantage in schools starts at a young age.  It will not all be resolved by addressing the leaving certificate or access to third level education.

The NCCA got 740 responses to a survey it undertook as part of the consultation.  It got 240 witness submissions.  It had 13 focus group meetings with 275 individuals, as well as eight bilateral meetings and 19 one-to-one engagements.  Therefore, there has been a significant amount of consultation material to get through since the consultation finished at the end of November.  The NCCA has recently commenced an analysis of that input to the consultation process.  The aim is that it will have a report on that consultation early this year.

I have two quick questions.<\/p> <p>  The Department's statement on new and revised curricular specifications includes clear statements on digital learning skills and the use of digital technologies.  It was mentioned in the debate in the Seanad last week.  I would like to ask the officials if there are any plans to develop a national online learning programme, as recommended by this committee on the work that was done and on the report that was carried out and published on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary education.  At the time, SOLAS stated to the committee that it would be happy to assist the Department of Education in developing such a programme, similar to the one that the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has in place.  Has the Department been in contact with SOLAS in this regard?  If not, do the officials see any merit in liaising with SOLAS officials to ascertain how this can be done?  We have to learn lessons post Covid-19.  It is great that the Government will have a separate report on Covid-19 and I have no doubt but that it will take health, education and living into account.  However, this is just one part that we need to address.  We need to see what the officials have to say on that.<\/p> <p>  As well as this, the Library Association of Ireland has recently corresponded with the committee regarding the need to increase the number of school libraries.  This was a recommendation and I am nearly sure that it was in the programme for Government.  I strongly believe in encouraging young children, both in primary and in post primary, to read.  A love for books is fundamentally important.  This is especially because, I think we can all agree, young children are now on technological devices.  If they were allowed to stay on them, they would be on them morning, noon and night.  I am a father of an 11-year-old, a ten-year-old and seven-year-old.  I have no doubt every parent will agree with me and can put themselves in my shoes.  I will not say the word \"rows\" because I do not want to be too dramatic, but it is continuously a fight to get young people off devices nowadays.<\/p><p>We need to give them the opportunity to read books, bring books home from school, exchange books and things like that.  It is difficult for some families to go to the public library, but if the library is in the school, it gives them an opportunity to exchange books and bring books home.<\/p><p> Particularly during the pandemic, we have seen the effect that technology devices have on young children and families as a whole.  There were no sporting activities and no school or anything else, so the only way to communicate was through devices.  I tabled a parliamentary question before Christmas and I questioned the Minister about investment in more school books before the budget.<\/p><p> I have one further question after the witnesses answer those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#U00300","speaker":"1619","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Someone else may wish to add something to what I will say.

In terms of budget, the most recent budget announcement and our previous one were aimed more specifically at children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  We are very alive to the need to encourage reading, both within the classroom as part of formal experience but also, obviously, outside of that.  There is certainly plenty of evidence and literature that reading, including reading for pleasure, is a very positive reinforcing factor in the lives and education of students.  <\/p> <p>  I do know if others may want to say something further on that.

I have no doubt work could be done in conjunction with county councils and local authorities throughout the country on this.  If the Department of Education was to do work with the library services and the Library Association of Ireland on that, I would encourage it.  Has Mr. Tattan been told by his children that he is an out-of-touch father because he is taking away the devices?

That would include options such as apprenticeships and going on to further and higher education.

I am sorry I was delayed.  I was at another meeting but I have listened to a good bit of the debate.  Many of these questions have probably been asked so I will be brief.<\/p> <p>  Something I take from my time teaching is that I always tried to examine what the students knew rather than what they did not know.  That was the principle that I always tried to take into my own assessment when I was teaching.  I suppose the big thing that has worked in the students' favour this year and last year, in terms of leaving certificate 2021 and 2022, is that they have an expanded range of questions and choice in those formal examinations.  Can Mr. Tatton comment if that is what is envisaged to continue in the short term, irrespective of the bigger question of leaving certificate reform?  I refer to 2023 and, perhaps, 2024.  Is that type of expanded line of questioning and choice and range set to continue into the future?

Sometimes there may be further questions added to the paper to give more choice.  Sometimes there is less required of a student in terms of content to be covered in order to be able to access the paper.<\/p> <p>  Over the past couple of years those have been responses to Covid and the disruption students have experienced as a result of Covid.  Obviously, there was quite a bit of positive feedback and I seem to remember, in terms of the examination, particularly the written examination last June, some of the pressures students would have experienced in trying to get through a paper in a demanding three hours or thereabouts timeframe seemed to have been lifted somewhat.  That is interesting.  It is something we need to reflect on in terms of whether that is an improved experience but I suppose, too, going back some of the earlier conversation, whatever assessment process we have now and into the future needs to be properly aligned to the curriculum and it needs to be a fair assessment in terms of the students' skills and knowledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tattan for that.  I have just one question and a comment as well.  Following on from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in relation to reports about what is happening with the Irish language, I spent most of my career teaching Irish and I suppose I would like to think that I know the challenges in terms of what is ahead for the language.  Mr. Tattan will not probably respond ahead of the report that the Department will issue but I suppose I would like to put it on the record that I believe that any suggestion of abolishing foundation level Irish would be a mistake.  It is a level at which certain children can be reached out to and, in terms of embracing the language, any suggestion that that would be abolished would be a mistake.  I hope that that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  I reinforce what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said in relation to providing an incentive for people to take higher level Irish.  For a long time in my teaching career, it was always a challenge to try to get children to continue taking higher level but the more children we can induce to take higher level Irish the better it is for the health and well-being of the language in the long term.  With mathematics and applied mathematics, we supplied inducements through bonus points.  That is something that needs to be considered for Irish.<\/p> <p>  My final question is on digital technologies.  It was referenced earlier that in the region of &euro;200 million was suppled during the pandemic to get schools up and running in  terms of information technology, IT.  Is that the level of investment we are likely to see continuing post-Covid given that is the general direction and tread in the teaching methodologies that are used by teachers and the access that students now would have at home as well to today's devices?  It is ironic that I am asking this question just after the Chair asked how do we get our children off devices but in terms of learning and the positive benefits that they can supply, is that level of investment likely to continue into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#X00300","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>On that, that struck me too.  I suppose like everything there are pluses and minuses to these things.  However, we know that for children, no more than with ourselves, their lives are so informed and so imbedded in digital, and it will be part of their lives.  We need to ensure that we are preparing them and, I suppose, ensuring too that there are balanced plans and that there are other experiences in life beyond that.<\/p><p>The level of investment is really important.  Obviously, it has been particularly important to support the remote learning that has been necessary.  We know that is not as good as the face-to-face experiences when students are physically in schools each day, but it was key in maintaining connection with students during that time.  In the context of the review of the senior cycle, the likelihood is that, as we have done to date and are likely to be doing, we will continue to devise new forms of assessment, some of which are going to be technology-based.  That is something that some subjects particularly lend themselves to.  It is going to be important that the structures are there and available to schools so that they can access them in a meaningful way in order that students can take up courses, excel and enjoy them.<\/p><p> On the question about Irish, I note the point the Deputy made about the foundation level and encouraging the use of the language for those in the higher achieving space.  From our perspective, we want students to continue to be able to engage with the national language at whatever level they wish and are able to do.  We will have to reflect on the work of the NCCA on level 1 and level 2.

That must match up with the apprenticeship opportunities that hopefully will be provided.   How many extra guidance counsellors would the Department anticipate being in place in the next couple of years?

I concur with the view that minds have been concentrated in recent years.  The issue has been around for a while but it has reached the point where we need to look closely at it.  Compared with systems in other jurisdictions, many positives have come out of the past few years in terms of the willingness of teachers to step up to the plate and in their public service commitment and collaboration to do things that were untested before.  I mention the voice of students as well.  The level of resilience in our system was exposed.  Other countries that relied more heavily on continuous assessment, project work, school-based assessment and so on were better placed to pivot and cope than Ireland was because we rely a lot on an external assessment and a terminal exam.

I would also like to discuss some of the policy decisions, particularly from the NCCA because we have heard some interesting testimony from some academics during the course of compiling this report.<\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships have been mentioned and it is fair to say that the future is a green one.  We are probably not seeing the amount of education that we need at the moment.  There has been significant investment in third level education but that is very recent and one of the difficulties is how we ensure that younger students in second and even first level education would go into the kind of areas where the future is likely to be.  I would like to think that if we concentrated more on mentorships and transforming the school system so that it appears more like transition year throughout school, that could have an influence on what people choose to do because they would have some experience.<\/p><p>However, now we have quite an academic model of education, which is leading people in a different direction.  <\/p><p> The Department has shown it would consider remodelling assessment.  That was a positive evident in the previous contribution, particularly in light of the flexibility shown in other jurisdictions during the pandemic, which shows the importance of such flexibility.  The conversation on a hybrid model leaving certificate is probably about having such flexibility.  What may be needed is not so much a hybrid model as having continuous assessment.  Currently, students are very much under pressure.  While it is important to consider a hybrid model for this year, we need to consider a continuous assessment model into the future.<\/p><p> The pandemic has had an influence on the way people view caring work in society.  I would reference the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.  If we were to carry out a similar exercise, people would have a very different approach to education following the pandemic than they had prior to it.  We are at a crucial point now.  I have spoken for way too long and note the time I have taken.  I would welcome any thoughts the witnesses would have on those comments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#Z00300","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments and questions.  Mr. Moran may also wish to comment further on the Senator's points.  In terms of the NCCA process, we have had engagement with the NCCA since it submitted the report.  It had provided us with a briefing.  It has worked in very well both international and national research on the views, experience and knowledge of academic ideas, which is very much reflected in the work it has done.<\/p> <p>  On apprenticeships and the academic system we have, we are very mindful efforts have been made to raise the profile and prestige around apprenticeships in recent times.  One factor in the context of senior cycle review, which is perhaps beyond senior cycle in a sense, is about pathways, which is about preparing students for what they want to do in the next stage of their lives.  Pathways in the past may have been more linear in terms of a pathway to college or going to work but now individuals may move in many different directions.  We need to ensure we are student-centred and that there are opportunities to move.  It may be that people want to move into work, training, apprenticeship or change careers and so on.  That level of flexibility and mobility is important to us.<\/p> <p>  Transition year could provide good opportunities.  Certainly there are many good examples of transition year programmes that have worked really well and that have had very good links with employers, higher education, further education and so on.  We would like to raise that to the point where there is greater evenness in the spread of experience students get during transition year.<\/p> <p>  On the hybrid model versus continuous assessment, there is an interesting point around that.  What we might say about the system of accredited grades is that it was a response to a particular emergency situation, but it should not be mistaken for an answer to some of the challenges around the leaving certificate or senior cycle and, potentially, continuous assessment or different forms of assessment may offer us more opportunities.  On the pressure point aspect, there may be an inevitability and some degree of pressure in addressing what is a significant moment in the lives of students and it may be unavoidable.  However, very high levels of stress are unacceptable and where the experience is dominated by an exam rather than what is happening in school each day in their learning environment, we have to question the process.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator's final point on the impact of the pandemic in terms of implications for gender and other issues in society is an interesting one and something we need to be cognisant of in the context of implementation.

They emphasised that there would be a benefit from decoupling the leaving certificate from the admissions institutions that we have in Ireland at present.  Obviously, if people described the primary purpose of the leaving certificate then, unfortunately, I think that many of them would say that it determines what a person does at third level as opposed to the culmination of all the work that he or she has done at second level.  Does Mr. Tattan think there is any benefit in trying to decouple the leaving certificate from admissions to third level?  Obviously, we would save the third level institutions a huge amount of trouble by deciding admissions on the basis of the leaving certificate results.  Is Mr. Tattan concerned that if we decoupled it too much, we may find ourselves in an unfair situation, as can happen in other countries, whereby there would be a system of admission to third level that would be difficult to identify?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#BB00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>There probably are, and I think the Deputy has touched on some of the arguments.  There are arguments both ways on this one.  On the one hand, there is a huge convenience in having a simple set of exams, which is a route through to things like higher education if that is where one wants to be.  The leaving certificate is obviously not that and should not be viewed as that.  I am not saying that the Deputy is saying that though for many it is, in effect, a passport to higher education.  Often that is where the pressure is created.  Much of the commentary is about the pressure, particularly in the context of high-demand courses and that back flows into the leaving certificate and, therefore, the senior cycle experience too.  At one level, one might say if we were to decouple this would that be a way to ease that sort of pressure.  However, I would not be too sure of that for a couple of reasons.  One is that, presumably, if it were not there, something else would have to replace it in terms of higher education admissions.  Although this means that that would then become where the pressure point is.  That situation could be worse for students in many ways because unless we were to ditch the leaving certificate, they would have a leaving certificate but it might be far less regarded than it currently is whereby it might just be seen as something that has to be gone through.  Really, however, the focus, if a person wants to go on into higher education, is whatever the process is there.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, some countries, especially the US, are questioning quite significantly their current admissions systems.  So things like the standard assessment tests, SATs, which were regarded as tried and tested methods of admission in the US, are now being questioned much more seriously.<\/p> <p>  Potentially, there is something there.  I think, perhaps, through keeping the integration there.  Is there a way for us to make it more holistic?  Should the final assessment someone gets at the end of the senior cycle experience be as narrow as a set of grades in a set of subject or could we make it broader than that?  Maybe things like transition year might offer opportunities around that, which might help to broaden it out and that it would be more than simply a set of marks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022012500002#BB00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dalton Tattan"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>This is a complicated issue.

Good afternoon to the Chair, Senators, Deputies, ladies and gentlemen.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Doctors Without Borders, would like to sincerely thank the committee for giving us this opportunity to present to it some critical humanitarian crises that we are responding to.  In doing so, we will highlight urgent humanitarian concerns that MSF is encountering through its work.<\/p><p> Last year was a major milestone in MSF&rsquo;s history as we reached our 50th anniversary.  However, in many ways, we felt there is little to celebrate as the global needs in humanitarian medical action have only increased during this time.  Major conflicts rage in Syria, Yemen and the Tigray region of Ethiopia.  Globally, there are increased numbers of refugees and displaced and vulnerable populations, an increasing impact of climate change on communities in the global South, and increasing attacks on healthcare facilities and workers in conflict-affected settings where MSF is present.  In South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, recurring outbreaks of preventable diseases such as malaria and cholera continue to cause high levels of mortality.  In addition, we have all been battling the global Covid pandemic for more than two years.  The new inequalities that it has created in access to vaccines, treatments and other medical technologies are a stark reality in MSF's work around the world.  It is an issue this committee has looked at before and which we would like to see remain on its agenda.<\/p><p> This afternoon, we would like to update the committee on two key contexts that are high in our priorities at present.  The first is Afghanistan, where MSF has worked for more than three decades and where protracted conflict has given way to a crisis involving a healthcare system which is entirely dependent on aid.  With a population now experiencing food insecurity, increasingly high levels of acute malnutrition are being reported from our medical facilities on the ground.<\/p><p> Second, the movement of people from one place to another has always occurred but, since 2015, MSF has borne witness to and assisted people affected by an acute humanitarian crisis, worsened by inhumane migration policies at Europe&rsquo;s borders and elsewhere.  Whatever the drivers of migration may be - whether it is war, conflict, persecution, climate change or economics &ndash; migrants deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity.  We last addressed our work on migration to this committee in 2018 and, regrettably, not much has changed since then.  MSF still operates a search and rescue ship in the central Mediterranean, where many lives are being lost as people make the treacherous crossing to try to reach European shores.  We know many people are being returned by the Libyan coast guard to places of detention in Libya that are overcrowded and rife with disease, and where they suffer further violence and abuse.  In the camps on the Greek islands, our teams continue to provide care to migrants and asylum seekers as their health and mental health deteriorates from years of living in limbo.  We see the desperation of these people, we treat the injuries they have received during their journeys or related to the conditions they are held in, and we continue to speak out.<\/p><p> Since last August, we have witnessed a new crisis emerging on the border between Belarus, Lithuania and Poland.  We will hear from a colleague from the MSF team that is providing assistance to migrants at border areas but where access to deliver medical care and humanitarian aid remains hampered.  The EU member states involved have failed to live up to their responsibilities to protect people&rsquo;s lives, to uphold basic rights of people seeking protection and to permit humanitarian assistance to reach vulnerable people, regardless of whether they are in a small boat crossing the Mediterranean or hiding in a snow-clad forest in Lithuania.<\/p><p> On behalf of MSF teams providing impartial, independent medical assistance on the front lines of humanitarian crises around the world , we thank the committee for inviting us today.  We will start our highlighting of a few key contexts by crossing to Sarah Leahy, recently returned project co-ordinator for MSF in Helmand province, Afghanistan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I am a project co-ordinator with MSF.  I worked in Lashkar Gah, Helmand province, from January until September 2021.  I was on the ground working with our team of more than 1,000 staff before, during and after the transition from the then Government of Afghanistan to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  I witnessed first-hand the challenges encountered by the Afghan people during the conflict and in the immediate post-conflict phase.<br\/><br\/>Since the change in power, MSF has continued to provide life-saving medical care to people in dire need across the country.  In five locations across Afghanistan, our medical teams are treating emergency trauma cases, supporting people with chronic conditions and welcoming new life to the world in uncertain times.  MSF is working in Lashkar Gah and Kandahar, both in the south, Herat in the west and Kunduz in the north.  MSF also runs a maternity hospital in Khost in the east of the country.  Hospitals and medical facilities across the country are under extreme pressure, with staff and equipment shortages due to a severe lack of funding.  At Boost hospital, we now have more than 1,300 staff and it is one of MSF&rsquo;s largest projects in the world.  The hospital now has at least 700 patients arriving every day - sometimes it is 900 - most of them children.<br\/><br\/>Levels of severe acute malnutrition have risen in MSF-supported facilities in recent months.  An average of 400 children per month are being treated for severe acute malnutrition in Boost hospital.  In the feeding centre, our team is working day and night to treat the direct medical complications of malnutrition, as well as constantly preparing therapeutic foods to feed every child three times a day.  Every one of these young patients is under five years old.  Many of them are also suffering from worrying complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea or gastrointestinal problems.  I saw the increase in children suffering from severe acute malnutrition with my own eyes in Helmand province last year.  This is likely due to persistent drought, food scarcity, an improved security situation, an economic crisis and a health system in a state of disarray.  As the only fully functional public hospital in the province, Boost hospital in Lashkar Gah is very busy.  Other public health facilities both within Lashkar Gah city and in nearby rural provinces continue to struggle to deliver services.  An average of 60 babies per day are delivered in the maternity department.  Some 100 babies were born in a single day in September, the highest number the hospital had ever seen, and in November, 1,900 deliveries were completed for a third consecutive month.  These are babies and mothers who, without the services of MSF, would not have access to free maternity care.<br\/><br\/>Seeing the crisis through the eyes of our national staff colleagues from Afghanistan is very insightful.  One of my colleagues, Mohammed, a doctor who has worked at Boost hospital since 2010, noted:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe are seeing double the usual numbers of patients in the feeding centre recently.  Our main concern now is that we&rsquo;re running out of beds.  At the moment, it&rsquo;s two families - one mother and one child - to every hospital bed.  We work hard to be flexible, but we can only admit the sickest.  This means triaging patients is really important, and we make sure that those we can&rsquo;t admit are seen elsewhere in the hospital.  Despite this, it is calm inside the feeding centre.  Although many mothers are anxious, they are happy that they are here and that their children are receiving high quality medical care. <\/blockquote><p>Mohammed also told me how the healthcare system has all but collapsed in Helmand, and people are now travelling from very far districts in the north of the province to reach MSF.  These are journeys that can take well over three hours, which is a long distance when a child is very sick.  The people who reach MSF are the lucky ones.  Many of them arrive on foot.<br\/><br\/>Mohammed told me of a family who came from a town called Musa Qala, which was under Taliban control as far back as 2020, and from where only a few patients have ever reached us.  Their story helps explain the crisis.  Mohammed said:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe family were very poor and struggled to find food while the young mother was pregnant.  This is the same for many families now &ndash; there are no jobs and everything in the market is very expensive.  People also have very limited access to information on health, so when their child is severely sick, they sometimes do not know what to do or where to go.  When the baby was born, the young mother became very weak and could not breastfeed her child.  The little girl was malnourished from the very first day of her life.  Although we treat many patients for approximately three weeks, this little girl has now been with us in the feeding centre for three months.  She is still weak, but we hope she will improve with our care. <\/blockquote><p>For years, the healthcare system in Afghanistan has been underfunded, understaffed and under-equipped and is reliant on foreign donors.  One of the greatest risks for the health system now is the risk of total collapse due to a lack of international support.  The ripple effect of sanctions and other measures placed on Afghanistan's new government is being felt deeply nationwide.  The country faces near economic and institutional collapse, including an inability to provide the most basic services and pay civil servant salaries.  The banking sector is paralysed, which prevents people from accessing their life savings and complicates even the delivery of humanitarian assistance.  High rates of inflation are further increasing the strain on the majority of Afghans, who routinely struggle just to survive.  The United Nations stated in November 2021 that nearly 23 million people, or 55% of the Afghan population, are estimated to be in crisis or experiencing emergency levels of food insecurity.<br\/><br\/>Policymakers and donors must prove that they are committed to preserving or improving the welfare of the Afghan people by ensuring that punitive measures taken against the Taliban regime and its members do not make an extreme humanitarian and socioeconomic situation much worse and potentially irreversible.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee.

It is very much appreciated.<br\/><br\/>I will speak about the most recent programme I was involved in, from last year until the beginning of this year.  I have been working in the last year in three different migration contexts.  My year started with a refugee project we had in Sudan for the people who had to flee from the Tigray region in Ethiopia.  I then moved on and spent time in our Mediterranean mission where we have, as Ms Simpson mentioned, the <i>MV Geo Barents<\/i>, in the Mediterranean Sea to save lives at sea.  I spent the past two months in Poland and Lithuania for our response to the humanitarian crisis.  We see it as a humanitarian crisis, and not, as the media likes to title it, a migration crisis, in the area of Belarus bordering Poland and Lithuania.<br\/><br\/>We had a team arrive in Lithuania in September last year.  In October, we had an emergency team arrive in Poland.  In October, we sent additional teams into Belarus, where we have a stable project which has already been working for a couple of years and is concentrating on tuberculosis.  Our intention, as with most of the projects, was to reach out to the people most in need of humanitarian assistance.  From our perspective, this was very clearly the population that is caught between border guards on the Belarusian side and the European border guards on the Polish and Lithuanian side.<br\/><br\/>What is happening is that the people who cross into Poland and Lithuania are either directly pushed back and blocked from entering Poland or Lithuania or, once they have entered, they are taken by the border guards to the border posts where, on the Polish side, for example, they are issued a letter to leave Poland without any possibility of applying for international protection or asylum.  With this letter, they are then put back in the vehicles of the European border guards - in this case, Polish border guards - driven back to the border and pushed back across the border fence, a razor-wire fence that has been erected in both countries.  This is happening on both sides.<br\/><br\/>A few people who manage, under unclear and arbitrary criteria, to hand in a request for asylum in Poland or Lithuania are then automatically detained.  Both the push-backs and the detention are based on changes in the national legislation that Lithuania and Poland have been putting in place, successively.  They first put in place a state of emergency and have made changes in national legislation since July.  In the beginning, they used Covid very much as a justification to prevent people from applying for asylum.  Later, however, a state of emergency was established in both countries.<br\/><br\/>In 2021, we saw more than 35,000 push-backs in Poland.  That does not mean 35,000 people because we also know that many people have tried more than once to enter Poland and, in a kind of ping-pong process, they have been pushed back by border guards on both sides.  After the push-back to Belarus, they have not been able to return to Minsk where they originally came from as they have been blocked by Belarusian border guards and pushed across the border again into Poland or Lithuania.  We have seen more than 8,000 push-backs in Lithuania.  By the way, in 2021, we also saw more than 30,000 push-backs in the Mediterranean Sea.<br\/><br\/>What is happening is that these people are remaining in the forest area between the border guards, out of fear of being pushed back into the violence they have experienced on all three countries' sides of the border.  The border guards in Poland, Lithuania and Belarus are reportedly using violence against the migrants, the people on the move, during the push-backs.  While we have seen it more on the Polish and Lithuanian sides in July, August and September, since October-November we have been seeing an increase in the violence the Belarusian border guards are using, leading people in the forest to be afraid to come out and call for help because they will not have access to unconditional humanitarian assistance.<br\/><br\/>The border areas are cut off by the state of emergency.  Humanitarian organisations are not allowed to enter.  People remain in the forest in below-zero temperatures, without food and access to water and medical care because they know they will not get unconditional access or any right to apply for asylum or international protection when they report to the border guards.  This has been our struggle, which is one of the reasons we had to take the decision to withdraw our team from Poland.  The majority of the people, or the people in most need who are caught between the border guards, were not reachable for us.<br\/><br\/>From our perspective, this is another example of very reckless European border policies that are working with deterrence and disrespecting and violating people's rights while on the move.  People must have a clear legal way to request international protection.  They must have access to asylum procedures.  They must have access to legal assistance, which is not the case even after they have handed in their application for asylum.  As such, they will not have access to a lawyer and the legal assistance that should, by law, be provided to them.<\/p><p>The European Union has been quiet on the limitations of access, although this is happening on European borders and European border guards are driving people back, including sick children, into the forest in snow and freezing conditions.<\/p><p> Finally, the European Commission in December proposed an interim measures catalogue, which we assume is going to be voted on at the beginning of March.  From our perspective, it is a dangerous precedent for migration policy in Europe.  It will take away rights from people on the move and will no longer guarantee the most vulnerable have access to protection.  It will keep people in conditions that are absolutely unacceptable, with lengthy detentions, and will legitimise violations of European asylum law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ossig, Ms Simpson and Ms Leahy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>We are happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank our wonderful guests.  It has been an eye-opening experience to hear directly from representatives of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  I am sure they can appreciate that, in our role as a foreign affairs and defence committee, we receive much correspondence from many different areas.  Even so, I must be honest and say that nothing has struck me as much as a sentence in the documentation our guests provided, namely, &ldquo;The little girl was malnourished from the very first day of her life.&rdquo; That really struck me.<\/p> <p>  My first questions are for Ms Simpson.  This is the 50th anniversary of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  That is an achievement in itself and one which the organisation should celebrate where the opportunity presents itself.  She mentioned the increasing impact of climate change.  Perhaps she will give some us information on MSF&rsquo;s experience of climate change and the role it has played over the past 50 years.  What changes arising from climate change has the organisation seen?<\/p> <p>  Ms Simpson went on to mention Covid, and we all know the impact that has had throughout the world.  She referred to other medical technologies.  Will she elaborate on them?<\/p> <p>  Finally, will Ms Simpson give us a broader understanding of the role played by the search and rescue ship in the central Mediterranean Sea and the kind of work it undertakes?<\/p> <p>  Ms Leahy spoke about Boost hospital, its 1,300 staff and the 900 people, most of them children, who arrive every day.  Will she outline the capacity in that hospital and describe the facilities?  She spoke also of an area from which MSF sees very few people coming.  It may be slightly na&iuml;ve of me to ask, but is that because they have access to other medical care, or is it an area MSF considers of deep concern because so few people from that area come forward seeking medical attention?  There was a reference to 100 babies being born in a single day.  That is a major maternity hospital in and of itself, which is why I would like to know more about the capacity and the facilities at the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00400","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank our guests and congratulate them on the anniversary of the organisation they represent.  One of them used the term \"feeding centres\".  As a mother of two children in Ireland, that is not a word I come across when I bring them to a children's hospital.  Nutrition is something we take completely for granted in this country.  It hit home when our guests narrated the story of the doctor, Mohammed, saying the feeding centres were calm.  I had never heard the term before and it seems almost to be from another realm, given how difficult it is for us to comprehend.  It is upsetting that the organisation's main patients are children under the age of five.  As Deputy Clarke said, to think a child would suffer from malnutrition from birth is awful and very sad.<\/p> <p>  I again thank our guests for their work.  If there is anything we can do as a committee to support it, they might let us know.  I appreciate how important that work is, not just in Afghanistan, Belarus and the other places they mentioned but throughout the world where M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has or has had projects.

I stand in awe, as I am sure all my colleagues do, of the great work they do.  It is extraordinary and quite wonderful, and anybody remotely civilised would want to support them in every way.<\/p> <p>  Forgive my ignorance; I should know this but I do not.  Does MSF get any state funding from the various member states, and if so, is it adequate?  Is it funded from Ireland?  If not, is it a deliberate exercise on the organisation's part to keep away from state funding?  If there is any way we could assist in that regard as a committee, we will try.<\/p> <p>  I have been watching, as I am sure virtually all colleagues have, television programmes and bits of news pieces on Afghanistan, where it seems society is breaking down in many ways and there is significant malnutrition, suffering and disintegration.  I acknowledge MSF is not a political organisation but rather is voluntary and exists to deal with the symptoms rather than the politics.  Nevertheless, in our guests' practical experience, do they believe the sanctions on the country should cease?  What do they think of the idea of linking sanctions to the achieving of human rights there?  I saw a report recently - I cannot recall where - that suggested the Taliban was going back to form and reversing in respect of its attitude to women, and there were a few bad episodes in that regard.  I am interested to hear our guests' comments on that.  Do they see any evolution from the earlier Taliban?  It presented an attempt at good PR in the beginning, but I wonder what the reality is.  Either way, it is a society that has broken down and I salute MSF's work there.<\/p> <p>  On Belarus, it seems the poor migrants on the borders are being treated as footballs or chess pieces in the game of geopolitics.<\/p><p>It is just shocking.  The witnesses might forgive me as I had an interruption while Belarus was being spoken about.  Are many of the migrants making it to Poland and being treated properly there or are they just being put backwards and forwards in a wrong kind of way?  Maybe MSF will elaborate a little on that.<\/p><p> My final question relates to Covid and all the migrants and other people MSF deals with.  I assume Covid is a major issue and that there are questions as regards vaccination.  I would be interested in the witnesses' comments on that.  I am sure they would be of the view we need to vaccinate everybody in order for everybody to be safe but I include all criteria.  MSF might comment on that.  If I had no questions I would, together with colleagues, salute what the organisation does and say we stand in awe of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#D00700","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I have been looking through MSF's website.  As some colleagues have stated, we are all a bit in awe of what the organisation does.<\/p> <p>  Certainly, the world is in a very precarious place.  MSF works in many countries across the globe, including Bangladesh, with the Rohingya, the Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Niger and so on.  The organisation also works in some countries that have taken in an awful lot of asylum seekers and refugees and it looks after those people.  MSF volunteers work in some of the most dangerous places in the world and put themselves at serious risk.  I ask that the witnesses comment on that risk.  Have any MSF volunteers been injured, assaulted, unlawfully detained and so forth?  Obviously, because they are working in parts of the word where disease is rampant, they are also at possible risk from illness and disease themselves.  In addition, it strikes me that if somebody goes to work in some of these situations that are very difficult - and extraordinarily so, to the extent that I am lost for words - the actual stress, strain, pressure and psychological impact on MSF volunteers must be enormous given what they are dealing with every day.  There is perhaps the feeling of helplessness that some of us might feel as well when we hear what the witnesses say.  What can we do?<\/p> <p>  MSF does not take any funds from the European Union.  It did in the past but no longer does since the EU's agreement with Turkey.  The witnesses might comment on that matter as well.<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that democracy is in retreat globally.  There are an awful lot of regimes across the world.  I am aware MSF goes into all situations completely neutral and looks after all sides in a conflict provided that they leave their weapons at the door, which is good.  It cannot be easy, however.  When one looks at all the countries in the world where there is conflict and literally hell on earth, one can see that we are totally cocooned in this country.  Our problems are first-world problems compared with what the witnesses have described.  It must be absolutely shocking.  The question is what can be done.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses tell me how many people from Ireland are working abroad in other jurisdictions?  How many Irish volunteers does MSF have?  I know one or two people who are working and the impact on them has been enormous.  They will never be the same again having seen what they have seen and been through what they have been through.

I lost the connection a little bit during the final questions but between us we will manage to answer.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the question around climate change and how we see that affecting out programmes.  We have expertise in many things at MSF but climate change is one that is still as steep learning curve for us and I do not profess to have all the answers for that.  I might use some of our programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa as an example, such as those in places like Mozambique and South Sudan.  We see climate change affecting the communities we work with there in many different ways.  That can be affecting people's harvests which leads to poor food security and malnutrition.  It can be a source of conflict over precious resources like water.  It can also be in changing disease patterns because obviously climate change affects different vectors like mosquitos with malaria.  Thus, we see different trends emerging in disease patterns and it leads us to look at things like vector control in different ways than before.  Off the top of my head, I do not have any figures or data to illustrate the changes in disease but we see it very much.  Of course, it can also be a driver of conflict as well.  Many of the countries we work in are prone to civil conflict in any event.  When there is an economic downturn and competition for resources like food and water, it very often leads to greater conflict within these societies.  Similarly, we see changes in other countries we are working in such as ones in Asia and the Middle East.  If members would like more information on that, I can consult colleagues and send it on as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  I move to Covid and Covid technologies.  MSF, through our access to medicines campaign, has been doing much work lobby globally, but also within Ireland and with other civil society groups in Ireland, on the TRIPS waiver regarding how we can scale up global production of vaccines.  It does not just include vaccines but, as I said, also treatments and other technologies.  By other technologies we mean PCR and antigen tests, as well as basic things like how to produce reliable and adequate quantities of PPE when needed for epidemic outbreaks.  I do not want to be negative but while we may at this point have a feeling that the situation with Covid is improving, the future is still uncertain.<\/p><p>We still need to ensure that, globally and in many of the countries in which we work, authorities have access to adequate vaccine supplies and to antigen tests, diagnostics and sufficient protective wear during outbreaks.<br\/><br\/>I will talk a little about our role in search and rescue in the Mediterranean.  Ms Ossig might address that one too.  Our role is simply to save lives.  In the Mediterranean, we see overcrowded rubber dinghies that the majority of us involved in the meeting today would not even consider getting into in a swimming pool, let alone getting into one with 60 to 100 other people in order to cross the Mediterranean, particularly in view of unpredictable weather conditions and so on.  As we speak, our ship, the <i>Geo Barents<\/i>, has rescued 439 people over the past few days.  These people are still on board having being turned away from Malta twice.  They are now trying to find a safe port of disembarkation in Italy.  This is the situation that teams on the <i>Geo Barents<\/i>face every day.  The 439 people are from seven different rescue operations.  That will give the committee an idea of scale in the context of how many people are rescued during each operation.<br\/><br\/>We have at times been accused of being a pull factor and told that we are encouraging people to cross the Mediterranean because they think MSF will rescue them.  One cannot imagine the desperation of these people to put their wives and children in a rubber dinghy on the high seas because they think MSF will rescue them.  We are not the pull factor.  The push factor is the terrible conditions that they are fleeing from and the detention centres in Libya where many of them end up when they are rescued by the Libyan coast guard.  I will hand over to Ms Ossig, who may have something more to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Ms Simpson said much of what I would have said.  I will add one point from.  I did an interview for Irish media a while ago about the Mediterranean.  I said that we have a role there that should not be our role.  We should not be on the Mediterranean to save lives because that is the role of those states that border it and that have declared a search and rescue zone.  Since Italy and Malta are not fulfilling their role and are not getting sufficient support from the EU to save lives at sea, there is nothing left but for non-governmental organisations to save people's lives because people will leave Libya whenever they have a chance and regardless of whether there is someone on the sea to rescue them.  We have seen it with the thousands of people who have drowned in the Mediterranean.  They are people who are so desperate to put their families on boats that they do it independently, but it should be our role.  It should be the role of the European Union to provide the response that is coming from member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Leahy if she can take the questions about Boost hospital in Lashkar Gah.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Of course.  Deputy Sorca Clarke asked about the capacity and facilities at Boost hospital.  Maybe I can give a bit of an idea of what the hospital looks like.  As I said earlier, there are nearly 1,300 staff there and sometimes up to 900 patients.  When I was there, there were sometimes up to 1,000 patients in for emergencies.  It is a very large hospital.  It is a 300-bed facility but we often have two patients in a bed because we do not have the capacity to have one patient per bed.  It is important to note that if a woman comes to the hospital with a child, she must be accompanied by a male chaperone or family member because women cannot come to the hospital unaccompanied.  They often bring their children to the hospital.  This also puts significant pressure on the hospital.  We have to feed everybody in the hospital and the kitchen might have to provide more than 4,000 meals today.<\/p> <p>  Regarding facilities in the hospital, we have an emergency room where we treat all of our patients initially before admitting them.  We have a large paediatric department.  Within that, we have a therapeutic feeding centre, which serves patients who have acute and severe malnutrition.  Ideally, these patients, who are all under five years of age, should be assessed by MSF and sent to other facilities, but these other clinics have not been operational since May 2021, or even before then when the fighting in Helmand province got very bad.  MSF ends up treating all of these patients, sometimes for months at a time.  The pressure is unsustainable.  We do not have anywhere to refer patients to.<\/p> <p>  We have a large maternity unit.  As I mentioned, I saw 100 women deliver on a particular day.  It is important to note that most women in Afghanistan deliver their babies at home.  These are primarily women with complications who are delivering late.  They experience obstructed labour.  Many arrive in a poor state and have not had any antenatal care because facilities are not operating to support them.<\/p> <p>  We run an operating theatre which in the past was not focused on trauma but which in recent times has had to.  From 1 May until the end of July, we treated 482 war-wounded patients in our operating theatre, which is a huge number.  Most of those wounds were called by shells and bullets.  More than a quarter of these patients were under the age of one.  More than 100 patients were just a few months old and had trauma from the conflict.<\/p> <p>  We have wards for post-operative care, including general inpatient wards segregated for males and females and large isolation units for contagious diseases such as measles and tuberculosis in which we treat Covid patients too.  There are patients who have comorbidities, such as presenting with Covid and tuberculosis, and children under five who have Covid.  We have a separate labour room for women who are in labour and have Covid.<\/p> <p>  We treat Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, which equates to a lesser version of Ebola and which has a very high mortality rate.  We have an outpatient department, which deals with more minor illnesses.  We have mental health services, which are so severely neglected that we can only really touch the surface.  We treat patients who may just have lost family members, who are at the end of their lives or who are extremely traumatised post conflict, which most people are.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked why patients could not get treatment in somewhere like Musa Qala.  There were no services there at all in the past because it was under Taliban control.  The population could not get in or out of this particular area.<\/p><p>They do not now have the resources to build any facilities there so they have to travel.  They trust MSF because everybody in Helmand province, and indeed most people in Afghanistan, have family members who have been treated by MSF in some capacity.  There is a deep trust there.  They also know that free healthcare will be provided and they will not be discriminated against, regardless of any ethnic issues.  They know they will get healthcare regardless.  We have been able to treat so many people, both members of the Taliban and those on the side of the Government of Afghanistan, because of our principles of independence, impartiality and neutrality.  That is why we are held in such regard in Afghanistan.<\/p><p> I will talk briefly about linking the sanctions to the achievement of human rights.  There are basic human rights.  For example, every individual has the right to live.  That means it is our collective responsibility to protect human rights and safeguard human life.  People need access to free healthcare to all.  Everyone has the right to equal treatment, irrespective of colour, caste, religion or gender.  That is not being upheld at the moment.  <\/p><p> It is important to note that our staff and beneficiaries do not have access to any money.  In a post-conflict phase such as the one Afghanistan is now in, people cannot rebuild their lives.  Humanitarian aid is being hampered, specifically at Boost Hospital where there is huge pressure on resources.  The hospital is seeing up to 1,000 patients per day, which compromises the quality of care.  Other services and facilities need to be operational in order for people to have basic access to healthcare.  I think I have covered the questions that were asked.  Is there anything else outstanding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Leahy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator Ardagh, mentioned the matter of funding, as indeed did Senator Joe O'Reilly.  I might narrow that focus by asking has the global Covid-19 pandemic in any way adversely affected donor funding for MSF.  What is MSF's relationship with any states on the matter of funding?<\/p> <p>  While I have the floor, I ask our guests to focus on two areas.  The first is the Tigray region of Africa and the dire humanitarian situation which exists there.  I note there have been calls for formal political engagement aimed at the cessation of violence which, if attained, would allow for humanitarian aid to be delivered.  Access to humanitarian aid in that region seems to me to be of particular importance, having regard to current weather patterns, the dangerous and conflicted situation, the failure of crops, the movement of people, starvation, hunger and famine.  Have our guests seen any improvement in the situation in Tigray in recent weeks as far as the capacity to deliver aid is concerned?<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the situation on the borders of Belarus and the European Union, with particular reference to Poland and Lithuania.  In her initial contribution, Ms Simpson was direct, as we would expect, when she said that the European Union has failed to protect life.  I acknowledge, of course, that her organisation comprises medical expertise and that in the course of her advocacy and work, she is always mindful of the need to be politically impartial, independent of politics and neutral in her comments.  We on the other side of this meeting are political practitioners.  Ireland is an active member of the European Union.  We pride ourselves on our membership of the European Union, which is strongly supported by the Irish people.  Ms Ossig, when considering the EU border situation, spoke of initiatives and the position taken by the European Commission which she described as setting a dangerous precedent in terms of forthcoming policy positions.  Would it be in order for me to ask what might this committee do, having regard to the fact that we are active members of the European Union?  We see on a daily basis, particularly in recent times, a dangerous build-up of military capacity in this region.  We have not in recent times, but in the course of the mid-winter and December we saw on our screens the forest conditions, particularly on the Belarus side of the border.  Ms Ossig gave evidence to the effect that people are freezing in the forest in a way that would seem contrary to any focus on a humanitarian situation or human rights.  Would our guests be in a position to offer us their best advice as to what we might do, as a foreign affairs and defence committee, in the context of Ireland's membership of the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I will go back to the funding question first.  We did, in fact, stop taking funding from any EU member state in 2016, as Deputy Stanton said.  That was a direct response to the EU-Turkey deal, which traded billions in aid for the effective outsourcing of border control and the subsequent measures and policies that were carried out in response to the movement of people.  As a humanitarian organisation, we found that incompatible with our principles.  Therefore, we decided that as long as the EU-Turkey deal was in operation, we would not received funding from any EU member states.  At that time, we were the only international organisation ever to give money back to Irish Aid, which used to fund us generously.  As an international organisation, we are 97% privately funded.  I am proud to say that we have 100% private income in Ireland from the very generous support of the Irish public.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Leahy touched on when she was talking about Afghanistan, our principles and independence are important to be able to address the needs of the vulnerable, as we see it.  That must not be attached to some government agenda or subject to other people who may try to manipulate funding in ways intended to serve their own agendas.  It is very precious to MSF that we are privately funded.  It gives us independence in our action and neutrality, and the possibility to treat those who we see as the most in need rather than those who others think are the most in need or groups of people to whom others do not want us to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance.<\/p><p>The very small bit of state funding we have comes largely from Canada and Japan but otherwise 97% of funding is private funding.  During Covid, we were in a very fortunate position because Covid has also has been a huge part of our work over the past two years.  Again, the public has responded to us in a very positive way so Covid has not had a detrimental effect on our funding.  During the Covid response, we had several programmes in Europe that under usual circumstances, we would normally not have considered launching but we had extensive programmes in European countries like Italy and Belgium.  We also have a very small intervention in Dublin where we partnered with an Irish organisation called Safetynet.  We set up a mobile Covid testing unit for vulnerable populations such as the homeless, those in direct provision and the Traveller community that Safetynet was able to operate and carry out testing on site.  <\/p><p> The next question concerned Tigray and Ethiopia.  Just over six months ago, three colleagues were killed in Tigray.  There is an ongoing investigation into their deaths.  For that reason, I am unable to elaborate on the situation in Tigray.  I can say that MSF does not have access to Tigray at the moment.  We would be open to giving individual briefings to any members of the committee who want to take the current situation in Ethiopia further but unfortunately, it is not something we can address publicly at the moment.  The situation relating to our colleagues is the priority and for that reason, I cannot discuss Ethiopia at present.  I apologise for that.  I will hand over to Ms Ossig, who can expand on the current EU proposal.  We also have an ask for this committee, which was in the closing statement but which I am very happy to address the committee after Ms Ossig speaks to it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isabel Simpson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Regarding funding, our intervention in Poland and Lithuania is an example where it is really important for us that these programmes are not funded by the EU or ECOFIN because we want distance from the political agenda.  Regarding comments on what can be done and that democracy seems to be in question in many countries, one of the most important points regarding Poland and Lithuania is the people need to get out of the forest.  It is still below zero in the forest and it is still snowing in Lithuania.  It has been snowing a couple of days ago and there are still children, women and men who are hiding in the forest on the European Union side because they do not have a safe, protected and unconditional way out of the forest.  They will continue to hide there until they can make their own way out of it.  We need to get them out of the forest because if we do not, the death toll will not stay at 21.  There will be more deaths because people will continue hiding because of the fear of being violently pushed back and not having any fundamental rights respected.  This is the major call from our side.  European member states and the European Union must find a way to get these people out of the forest unconditionally and provide them with a safe way to access their basic rights.<\/p> <p>  We also hope the countries that are concerned about the rights of the migrants will raise their voices towards the European Union and the European Commission to criticise and oppose the proposal that we believe is endangering respect for the fundamental rights of migrants.  The proposal, for example, allows an lengthened period for the registration of asylum applications of up to four weeks.  This will very likely come with automatic detention at the border posts.  The proposal also will allow people to be detained at the border posts where they will say they will be able to implement asylum procedures so they do not have to go to a registration centre any more, as it can be done at the border posts.  The proposal will allow the respective countries to, under the provision of only covering basic needs, detain people up to 16 weeks.  From our perspective, this is unacceptable because it violates any kind of asylum law that has been put in place and the EU asylum directive.  There is no exemption for vulnerable groups.  The screening of vulnerable groups and specific risks to groups regarding their home countries and potential deportation are not properly covered.  There is no call for humanitarian access.  The only call in the proposal is for vague co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.  There is no adequate monitoring mechanisms that will ensure that human rights are not violated to the extent that they are being violated at the moment by the national legislation put in place by Poland and Lithuania.  Our call is for concerns to be raised and objections to be made to the proposal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022012500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frauke Ossig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I reiterate our call for the committee to voice its concern to the Department of Foreign Affairs and EU counterparts regarding the continued pushback of people from European borders.

As they have heard from me and my colleagues, the communities that MSF assists are dealing with multiple and, at times, very complex challenges.  I hope they have been motivated by the briefing.  For us speaking out is the first step to try to effect change.  In regard to Afghanistan, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res reminds donors that humanitarian assistance is now more important than ever.  Support to the population needs to be maintained regardless.  Donors must find a way to ensure that continuous funding of essential humanitarian programmes in healthcare but also across other sectors is maintained, including support to food security.  As we have discussed today what has made many situations more complex for us over the past two years, for communities and medical staff on the ground in all our project locations, is the Covid-19 pandemic.  Due to the inequalities that exist, communities with little or no access to vaccines, treatments and tests are now more vulnerable.  While vaccine production is increasing, access inequity remains a concern when demands for booster vaccines continue to grow.  To ensure sustainable supply globally and to break from the current unequal production and supply structure globally, it remains important that countries are supported to engage local production and supply.<\/p> <p>  Intellectual property barriers in Covid-19 go beyond vaccines and also include therapeutics, diagnostics and key materials and components needed for the productions.  MSF Ireland asks this committee to continue its work on vaccine inequity and to write to the Government expressing its support of the recent Seanad motion supporting the TRIPS waiver.  Additionally, MSF asks this committee to write to the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment urging it to hold a public meeting on Ireland's position on the TRIPS waiver where it can call in expert witnesses in this field.  Furthermore, in recognition of the people on the move and their right to seek asylum within the EU's borders we reiterate to the Department of Foreign Affairs the need to voice its concerns with EU counterparts regarding the push-backs, not to support the proposal but instead to protect vulnerable people.  Put people first, and seek solutions that comply with international and EU obligations.

I am delighted to have been invited before the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health to discuss the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.  As members are aware, the Ombudsman for Children's office, OCO, is an independent statutory body, which was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, as amended.  The OCO has two core statutory functions, which are, to promote the rights and welfare of children under 18 years of age and to examine and investigate complaints made by or on behalf of children about the administrative actions of public services, public bodies, schools or voluntary hospitals that have, or may have, adversely affected a child.<\/p> <p>  Promoting the rights and welfare of children experiencing mental health difficulties has been a strategic priority for this office since 2016.  As members of the sub-committee may be aware, the OCO has previously expressed serious concerns about the statutory framework provided for under the Mental Health Act 2001 in respect of children, as well as about delays in progressing corresponding legislative reforms in this area.  Accordingly, we welcome the publication of the general scheme of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2021.<\/p><p>Following its most recent examination of Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of its obligations to children under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended in 2016 that Ireland &ldquo;enact legislation that explicitly and comprehensively provides for children&rsquo;s consent to and refusal of medical treatment, and ensure that the legislation is in line with the objectives of the convention and encompass clear recognition of the evolving capacities of children&rdquo;.  The committee&rsquo;s strong expectation that the State will amend the 2001 Act in this regard is evident in the list of issues prior to reporting which the committee published in respect of Ireland, more recently, in November 2020. <br\/><br\/>The OCO&rsquo;s assessment of the current general scheme has focused on proposals which concern the admission and treatment of children to approved inpatient facilities, and, as such, on Part 8 of the scheme.  In this regard, we support the proposal to include a dedicated part focused on provisions affecting children under 18 years of age.  However, in our view, a number of the current proposals under Part 8 do not have sufficient regard to children&rsquo;s rights and evolving capacities and do not provide adequately for a child-centred, rights-based approach regarding children&rsquo;s admission to, and treatment in, approved inpatient facilities. <br\/><br\/>Members of the sub-committee have a copy of the OCO&rsquo;s observations on Part 8, which we submitted in December 2021.  In the remaining time, I would like to highlight a number of issues addressed in our observations.  Head 104, section 84 sets out guiding principles that will apply in respect of children.  We welcome that these are intended to guide all decisions made in respect of the admission and treatment of children under Part 8 and, as such, that these proposed principles will guide the decisions made by mental health care professionals and the courts.  We also welcome the provision made for the best interests of the child to be treated as the primary consideration via head 104, section 84(a).  We suggest that consideration should be given to making appropriate provision for the factors that need to inform an assessment and determination of what is in the best interests of the child, taking into account relevant international human rights standards. <br\/><br\/>While the proposed guiding principles have the potential to promote a more child-centred approach to decisions affecting children under 18 years, we are of the view that the current provisions, including those concerning the views of the child, need to be strengthened.  In this regard, we believe that further consideration needs to be given to the relationship between the proposed guiding principles; how the provisions made in relation to the proposed principles can guide their appropriate application in practice; and including additional principles, a number of which we outline in our observations. <br\/><br\/>We welcome the attention given to strengthening provisions for children&rsquo;s right to be heard in decisions regarding their admission to, and treatment in, approved inpatient facilities.  This includes the provisions made for children aged 16 years and older to be able to consent to their admission, including the presumption that any child aged 16 years or older has capacity to consent to or refuse admission to an approved inpatient facility.  <br\/><br\/>However, we are concerned about provisions made in relation to children under 16 years of age.  For instance, we have significant concerns about the proposed scope of &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; admissions in respect of children under 16, whereby the admission of such a child will be deemed &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; on the basis of the consent of the child&rsquo;s parent or parents or person or persons acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  We are of the view that this fails to give appropriate recognition to the child&rsquo;s status as a subject of rights and we suggest that serious consideration needs to be given to applying the category of intermediate person to children under 16 years who are admitted on the basis of parental consent. <br\/><br\/>We welcome that the proposed guiding principles make it standard that children should be cared for and treated in an age-appropriate environment.  However, that this provision is accompanied by the clause &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo;, and that the scheme permits the admission of children to adult inpatient facilities, is a symptom of a systemic failure on the part of the State.  That failure has been maintained over many years and means that, 15 years after Vision for Change, we still do not have sufficient appropriate child and adolescent mental health services and supports available.  I ask that the sub-committee is strong and ambitious about this issue and that it seek to prevent all admissions of children under 18 years to adult inpatient units.<br\/><br\/>The OCO is among a range of stakeholders that have highlighted the need for children and young people with mental health difficulties to have access to independent, specialised advocacy services.  We welcome the provisions under the general scheme for children admitted as voluntary, intermediate or involuntary persons to be entitled to engage an advocate, either by themselves or with their parent or parents or person or persons acting <i>in loco parentis<\/i>.  In this regard, we are of the view that appropriate advocacy services need to be made available to all children who wish to avail of them, irrespective of means, and that children should be supported to access such services.<\/p><p>We also welcome the provision under head 117, section 97(1), that in every case brought to the court under Part 8, a legal representative must be appointed to the child.  As regards the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, section 97(3) provides for the court to also appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>for the child &quot;unless it is not in the best interests of the child&quot;.  While the circumstances in which it might not be in the best interests of a child to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>are unclear, we are strongly of the view that there should be a presumption in favour of appointing a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The proposals set out in the 2021 general scheme in respect of children present a significant opportunity to legislate for a child rights-based approach to decision making in respect of children who may require inpatient care and treatment for their mental health.  It is crucial that these provisions are fit for purpose.<br\/><br\/>We thank the committee again for the invitation to this meeting today.  My colleagues, Dr. Karen McAuley and Mr. Diego Castillo Goncalves, and I will be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Muldoon.

I refer young people who are non-verbal, who have hearing or vision impairments or a multitude of those and who obviously also have mental health issues.  Has Dr. Muldoon's office given any consideration to how they should be treated, particularly those who are under 16?  This may be a small group of young people, but it is a group that is profoundly affected.  If these young people fall into a situation where their mental health is compromised or challenged, it that can be very serious, especially if they are non-verbal.

For young people with physical disabilities, including those who are non-verbal, there has always been a huge difficulty with what is called dual diagnosis, where a child has a learning disability and a mental health issue.  There is really limited access to mental health services.  What we are looking at here is trying to formulate child rights-based legislation that will allow for the services to be provided in a child-centred way.  We will need to have the services and resources in place and the professionals available who can understand and work with children in those circumstances.  They need to be trained to hear the voice of the child, however that is transmitted.  Non-verbal children will often use painting or sound to communicate in some way and there are people who understand how to work with those children and young people, including psychologists, special needs workers and others working in that area.  Parents can help a lot as well.  It is something in which we really need to invest time and energy.  If we work from the single point of view that every child's voice is important in these circumstances, then we need to be able to facilitate those children whether they are blind, deaf, non-verbal or acting out with challenging behaviour.  Once they have a mental health issue that necessitates admission to an inpatient unit, that unit needs to be fit for purpose to deal with those children and young people.

There seems to be contradictions between the amendment of this Act, which seeks to give 16- and 17-year olds the capacity to consent to their mental healthcare, but it does not seem to be doing the same in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act in relation to wardships of court.  Do the witnesses think that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act should be amended while we are waiting for the reform of the Mental Health Act?  Do they have any concerns about what will happen if it is not addressed at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and we have to wait for this Bill to move through both Houses?  My understanding is that it has taken seven years to get to the point following the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to provide for under-18s.

It seems that some of the most vulnerable children, with acute mental health needs, are admitted to adult psychiatric hospitals.  It is a frightening experience for any child to be admitted to a hospital for mental health reasons but that is made worse and exacerbated if the child is admitted to an adult psychiatric ward that does not meet their needs.<\/p> <p>  Last year, 27 children were placed in adult psychiatric facilities.  While I acknowledge that this figure is a good deal lower than in previous years, which is welcome, it is still 27 children too many.  The children and young people who were placed in these facilities are already in an incredibly difficult place with their mental health.  This practice is, therefore, unacceptable.  Will Dr. Muldoon elaborate on capacity issues in youth mental health services, such as the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and other youth mental health services?  I will also raise this matter during statements on youth mental health in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.

In my first couple of years as ombudsman, I felt it was okay to keep this option open.  However, what is happening now is we have become lazy about it and we have let the idea that we do not have the resources in place rule the fact that the best interest of the child is being overrun.  We need to move forward from that.  That is why I am asking for a nil or zero option in regard to putting children into adult wards.<\/p> <p>  We did a report in 2018 titled, Take My Hand, in which we talked to children in those adolescent inpatient units.  A number of them talked about the trauma they went through going into adult wards.

We also have to be aware that even to have children go into paediatric wards is not a positive step forward either, and we need to properly facilitate our children.  We had a case in which a child was in a paediatric unit for maybe three or four months, with no therapy, no education and no interaction with anybody except an occasional visit from somebody who wanted to adjust the medication.  That is not a way forward either.<\/p><p> We have to look at this in totality.  One step forward will be to prevent them going into adult psychiatric units and to make sure we force the resources to be provided and ring-fenced for our children now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>To me, having this in the Bill is to admit they do not see the proper resources being directed to youth mental health in the future.

I want to reinforce one of the points that Dr. Muldoon made earlier.  Members will recall there was a Private Members&rsquo; Bill dating back to 2016, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016, which was examined by a previous Joint Committee on Health in 2019.  We submitted our observations on the Bill, which had the best of intentions and was not endorsing the admission of children to adult facilities.  What it was doing was recognising that the practice occurs and seeking to put safeguards in place regarding the admission of children to adult units.  One of the concerns we expressed at the time was that an unintended consequence of doing that would be to establish a legal basis, if we like, for admitting children to adult units.  In effect, the current general scheme will do just that and it will establish a legal basis for doing it.  Therefore, while we acknowledge that, under the general principles, one of the guiding principles is to try to ensure that children are admitted to age-appropriate facilities, the &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo; piece that the Deputy referenced earlier, as well as head 128, which is the dedicated head in Part 8 dealing with the admission of children to approved adult facilities, effectively legislates for the admission of children to these facilities.<\/p><p>Our concern, as Dr. Muldoon mentioned, is that if we legislate for this, it may exacerbate what is already a protracted delay in implementing the measures and putting in place the resources to allow for an end to this practice.

To return to the issue of consent, I am trying to understand something mentioned in our guests&rsquo; opening statement and the information they sent us in September.  It relates to cases of children under the age of 16, where the consent of the guardian comes into play.  The September submission referred to assessing maturity.  Who does that and how does it work?  It may be a simplistic question, but is there a lower age bracket, similar to the lower age that applies to responsibility in law?  The principle of consent applies to children under the age of 16, but is there a point below which we do not assess maturity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#G00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I might come in here and touch on our concerns regarding consent for under-16s.  In this respect, we acknowledge the expert group recommended in 2015 that there should not be an automatic presumption of capacity for children under the age of 16 and that the provisions made in respect of children under 16 are in line with the recommendations made by the expert group.  We have no immediate difficulty with that proposal.  We also support the involvement of the child's parent or guardian in decision-making regarding the child's prospective admission and treatment in an approved facility.<\/p> <p>  However, having regard to the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we are concerned that the use of a purely age-based approach in respect of children who are under 16 does not have sufficient regard to the evolving capacities of children, including in regard to making decisions about their own mental health and treatment.  In this respect, we would favour the more nuanced approach that was previously proposed by the Law Reform Commission and the special rapporteur on child protection.<\/p> <p>  It might be helpful to explain what we mean by this nuanced approach.  We suggest provision could be made such that a child under 16 years could give or refuse consent to his or her admission, care or treatment in circumstances where it has been established the child has the maturity and understanding to appreciate the nature and consequences of the specific decision in regard to his or her admission or treatment.  This would arise when the young person understands the treatment, why it is being recommended and what will happen if he or she accepts or refuses it.  In our view, this case-by-case basis approach would be more aligned with a child rights-based approach and with relevant provisions of both the Convention on Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It can be seen in other jurisdictions, including the UK and Canada, as referred to earlier.  In Canada, for instance, there is not an age-based approach at all.<\/p> <p>  As for who will make the decision, one concern we have is that, although the guiding principles provide for a child of under 16 who is capable of forming his or her own views to be consulted and to have due weight given to his or her views, the heads of the Bill appear to be silent on the matter the Deputy raised relating to who will assess and determine whether a child of under 16 is capable of forming those views and how this will be done.  It also appears that the heads of the Bill, in their current form, are silent on what measures will be taken to ensure due weight will be given to the child's views, including in regard to his or her proposed admission.  Another concern is that a subsection of the general principles relating to whether a child under the age of 16 is capable of forming his or her own views includes a provision for the child to be consulted where practicable.  Our view is this provision should be deleted; the child should always be consulted.<\/p><p>Further attention needs to be given to this as well as to another provision under the guiding principles in regard to giving due weigh to the views of the child and that how they interact with the views that are given by the parents or by the guardian.

There are a couple things I might add on that.  First, allowing that this is general scheme and not the actual Bill and therefore the wording may be adjusted, I would flag the way it is currently set out under section 97(3).  It states that a GAL would be appointed unless it is not in the child's best interests.  We find that an unusual form of wording in and of itself, irrespective even of what the child care (amendment) Bill will say about the appointments of GAL in care proceedings.  This is primarily because it raises the question of what circumstances would it not be in the best interest of the child to appoint a GAL?  Whether it is necessary, etc., is a different question.  However, it suggests that it would not be in their best interests.  We think that needs clarification.  It may just be that the wording is a bit awkward, to be fair, but we do not know that.  The reason we think that is because one of the core roles of a GAL is to recommend to the court what is in the best interest of the child.  That is one of its fundamental functions.  That is the first point.<br\/><br\/>The general scheme of the child care (amendment) Bill 2021 was published last autumn.  As the Deputy knows, it is looking to do a number of things.  It is to set out in law the role and functions of a guardian <i>ad litem<\/i>, etc.  In the current wording, again allowing that this is the general scheme, two things are worth noting.  First, in proceedings before the High Court, a GAL is automatically appointed.  For example, in proceedings relating to the placement of a child in secure care or special care, a GAL is automatically appointed.  Obviously, that is a form of civil detention, if you like, which involves a deprivation of liberty.  The admission of a child for inpatient care, for example, particularly in context of involuntary admission and detention, therefore, is also a form of detention.  We have to think about that and about parity there.<br\/><br\/>The other piece on the child care (amendment) Bill 2021 is on the proceedings in the District Court.  These are obviously care proceedings.  I appreciate the idea is that the District Court will be involved in such proceedings under this legislation.  What is provided for at the moment is more or less aligned with a presumption in favour of appointing a GAL.  It states that the court shall appoint a guardian<i>ad litem<\/i>for the child unless the best interests of the child can be determined in another way and unless the court is satisfied that there is another way to facilitate the child to be heard.  Therefore, it is a much more positive way of framing it.  Going back to the current general scheme, it may just be a question of wording that needs to be adjusted.  However, from our perspective it is not clear when it would not be in the best interest of the child.  As well as this, the wording seems strange.

This is that for admission to be voluntary there has to be an element of voluntarism involved.  If you are a child and for whatever reason you have concerns or reservations and do not wish to be admitted, for example, your admission, in plain English, is not voluntary.  There is no voluntary element to it.  This is not to critique parents in any way, but the idea that we provide in law that a child who expresses a wish not to be admitted would be admitted as a voluntary person solely on the basis of the consent of his or her parent is wrong.  That is why we are calling for a third category to be extended to under-16s.  That is an intermediate person.  That allows for a child to be admitted on the basis of parental consent but it removes this illusion that it is voluntary on the child's part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>The concept of an intermediate person also gives better data.

I will talk in hypothetical terms.  Allowing that there are only four State-funded inpatient units in the country, a child may have to move quite far away from his or her family, community and friends and the child may be concerned about that.  A child could be frightened about the prospect of being admitted to an inpatient facility if he or she has not been in one before.  There could be lots of reasons a child might refuse which could, potentially, be addressed professionally through consultation and seeking to alleviate concerns.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the legislation, members will know that one of the guiding principles, which is set out under head 104, is about the best interests of the child being treated as the primary consideration.  From a children's rights point of view, the way that is supposed to operate is that when assessing and making a decision about what is in the best interests of the child, one seeks to hear the views of the child on whatever decision one is trying to make, for example, the admission of a child to an inpatient facility, and give due weight to his or her views.  That is not the same thing as the child determining the decision.  If someone is trying to figure out what is in the best interests of this child, he or she must seek to hear what the child's views, wishes and preferences are, understand them and take them into account.  However, when someone is charged with making a decision that is in the best interests of the child and that is the primary thing he or she must think about, that is going to guide the decision-making.  The guiding principles allow for that.<\/p> <p>  I apologise for going a little off the point in answering the question but I will mention two important points, one of which we have flagged.  From the way the legislation is written right now, allowing that this is a general scheme and not the actual wording of the Bill, it is not clear how these principles are going to interact.  The text sets out a list of principles but does not say how they relate to one another.  Further attention needs to be given to that.  For example, there is nothing to suggest what I have just talked about, which is critical from a children's rights point, namely, that when assessing what is in a child's best interests, hearing the child's views is a pivotal part of that.  There is nothing in the principles to suggest that, however.  That is one of the reasons we have suggested that it would be worthwhile considering including in the Bill a provision setting out what are the factors that a decision maker, whether it is a health professional or a court, needs to consider when making a determination about what is in the best interests of the child.  We have that already in Irish law and we referenced it under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Adoption Act.  There are clear factors that are laid out, a list of things that one must think about when deciding what is in the best interests of the child.  It would be very helpful for decision makers to have an equivalent and appropriate list provided for under this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I do not know if those circumstances are rare but in such circumstances, the child can be involuntarily detained in his or her best interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00400","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen McAuley"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>The child could say and has the capacity to say that he or she does not want to seek treatment.<\/p><p>Obviously, the best interests of the child, medically and legally, would then be for him or her to be involuntarily detained to seek treatment.  It is quite a complex issue.<\/p><p> I have a final question on children aged between 16 and 18 years.  Assisted capacity essentially means a person of an age can make an independent decision regarding his or her own health, and so forth.  That is probably not the best definition but that is what I have come up with.  On children aged between 16 and 18 years, what is the determination about a child who is maybe in the throes of a pretty dire mental health situation and absconds or says he or she does not want treatment?  The child could be in a situation where he or she is very traumatised.  What happens in that situation, especially for that age group of young people?  Again, we come back to the point of the best interests of the child.  In circumstances, does that apply to that age group, namely, those aged under 16 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#L00600","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I think the Deputy is talking about the same situation.  He originally used the example of the eating disorder, which is hugely traumatic and invasive for the young person.  He or she will have his or her beliefs and will stick by them.  That will often mean that even if that young person weighs 7 stone, he or she will still not want to get help or will think that everything is okay.  In these circumstances, as Dr. McAuley outlined there, the important thing is we give weight to his or her voice and listen to them, especially when they are aged between 16 and 17 years.  At the same time, if it is a life or death scenario, the best interests may override that and it may be a situation in which we need to legally and medically take charge.  That is not going to change.  What has not happened before is that listening to the voice and the evolving capacity of the children and young people means the next time you have to make a decision about them it is going to be a bit easier because you have listened to them.  You have said to them that you are listening to them but we are still going to make this decision, although next time, we may listen and do something different.  Again, that creates a sense of hope within the child.  It creates a sense of being heard and being recognised as an individual.  The child will not like the answer but it creates an opportunity to build those relationships more strongly in the future.<\/p> <p>  At the moment, all it is is we are telling you that you are going in; that is all there is to it and there is no more about it.  However, we are now trying to build legislation that ensures children's voices are heard as best as possible based on their capacity.  However, it still does not override things - if it is a life-or-death scenario, as you would expect, it would not necessarily be the only answer.  That is same in many decisions, not just ones that concern mental health or medical treatment.  Children's voices and views are heard but other decisions can be made.  When we talk about children's rights, we always say to children it does not guarantee that what they want will happen but it will be heard and it will be heard and explained if it goes in a different direction.<\/p> <p>  Does that help?

He is the ombudsman and his office is focused on the rights of children under the age of 18 and ensuring that the voice of the child is heard.  Dr. McAuley gave some good examples of what is involved in reaching a consensus with a child.  An importance aspect is that the consultative process is done and the child&rsquo;s voice is heard.  There may be some ways to reach a consensus position with the child and the parents, particularly in the type of facility referenced.  I might explore that further.  Will Dr. Muldoon indicate one or two scenarios where the importance of hearing the voice of the child might lead to a positive outcome for the mental health of the child? <\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon mentioned children not being admitted to adult facilities and so on.  The challenge is accessing places when children are in acute episodes.  Will Dr. Muldoon give an example of what it might look like when a child in going through the process of an acute episode?  There is probably guidance available from the ombudsman's office for parents dealing with those dramatic situations but does another element need to be added to the legislation with respect to a crisis, acute situation?  I appreciate the detail Dr. Muldoon has provided,including the advocacy role of the office.  Those are a few comments.  I appreciate Dr. Muldoon has already gone through much of the finer detail with my colleagues. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#N00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1643068800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>If I picked the Senator up right, she put it well when she asked about the possibility of consultation to reach consensus.  That almost steps away from the medical model that has been in place for 100 years, namely, the patriarchal idea that \"I know best and I will medicalise you to make you better\".  Consultation and consensus is at the core of children's rights.  The legislation is moving in that direction, which is extremely positive.<\/p> <p>  Moving on some examples, the most difficult one, which Deputy Kenny spoke about, is bringing a child into a unit.  Some children will not want to go in.  It is important to negotiate and engage with children, understand where they are coming from and allay their fears and one would still probably have to bring them into a unit.  That discussion is probably the most important one because that would be at a time of acute episodes, as the Senator mentioned.  The other negotiation that is extremely important is when children sometimes do not want to leave an inpatient unit because it has become their safe space.  Having been in such a unit for eight to six eight weeks it could be scary for them to return to the world they left where they may have been hurt and the harm or negative thoughts became larger than life for them.  The best interests of the child are taken into consideration in that negotiation.  In many circumstances children will often leave a unit for a weekend and come back into the unit for five days and then leave again.  It is a matter of working with the child to find the best way to support him or her to return to the outside world.  That is a real example of listening to the voice of the child.  There might be a cross-over with respect to acute episodes.  In terms of the concept of a child being at his or her lowest ebb, whether the child has been taken out of a river following an attempted suicide, having abused alcohol or drugs or whatever it might have been that brought the child to the stage of attempting suicide, access to child-centred specialised services is crucial.<\/p><p>That is why we are pushing for zero tolerance for admission to adult units.  What happens in an adult unit is the child is put into a room on his or her own and is specialled.  Somebody sits with him or her and that is all they do.  We have had cases where children have been seriously afraid of the individuals around them, who may be experiencing serious psychotic episodes and may be much bigger and stronger than the child.  If a child is experiencing an acute episode, therefore, we have to provide the services and the flaw is on our side, as a State, if we do not provide them.<\/p><p> This is why we feel we should call time on the openness in regard to allowing children to be admitted to those units when necessary and to demand zero tolerance for it.  We need to get in there, invest our resources and ensure no children, in the most terrible and traumatic circumstances in which they can find themselves, will have to face additional trauma on top of that.  I heard a radio interview last week with a man talking about how spending even 24 hours in an adult unit had set him back by about two years in his recovery.  He was 17 at the time.  We really need to move forward on this issue.<\/p><p> I hope my response covered the answers the Senator was seeking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The experience Dr. Muldoon outlined is crucial to understanding the impact of this.

Sometimes I wonder about the supports that are in place for the adults around the child to bring him or her down the right path.  It can be a lack of awareness or of knowledge.  Dr. Muldoon spoke about having a legal representative, the appointment of a guardian and the intermediate person status.  We need to ensure the people around the child are able to provide, and allow for, that child-centred approach to take place, and there are many factors in that.

Without doubt, there should be zero tolerance for that.

I mentioned earlier a young man who had spent months in a children's unit even though he was required to be admitted to a psychiatric facility.  He also had an intellectual disability.  That dual diagnosis is really difficult for people to cope with but he was the one who had to compromise.  We compromised his care rather than find the suitable resources and way of doing it.  There have been crises and public outcries over people sleeping on floors when waiting for units.  Even when they are admitted to a unit, they will be just given a chair because there are no free beds.  That is on us as a society and State.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman was involved in the previous committee on this issue.  The mental health budget is miniscule.  We examined the only figures we could get.  Only 5.6% of the health budget relates to mental health.  I have been through this with many people.  We do not have a figure for how much we spend on children within mental health.<\/p><p>The best guesstimate I can come up with is that 20% of the mental health budget is spent on children, which means less than 1.1% of the overall health budget is spent on children's mental health.  If we have a problem with resources, straightaway, it is an allocation, a decision or a choice as to where we ring-fence this.  Even if we doubled the money spent on children, my guess is that it would make a huge inroad into those situations.<\/p><p> To me, the crux is to try to force the decisions of the Government so it cannot allow children to go into adult units any longer.  It needs to provide quality, well-staffed inpatient units, as well as going downstream and helping with primary care and those areas as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":242,"content":"<p>That picture Dr. Muldoon painted of the doctor sitting across from the parent and almost ignoring the child is quite harrowing, to be honest.

We are in a situation now where we are so far behind every other country on this.  We have piloted a programme for advocacy within two units but that must be three years in existence now.  The principle of everything that has been learned from that needs to be extended so that any child in a serious situation, or any child involved in CAMHS who might need advocacy and be serious enough for inpatient care, needs to have that advocate available to him or her.  We need to just roll that out.  I am not sure who would be best to do that but it is crucial that we provide it for the children.  Even if we include the private units, there are just six units across the country.  We are looking at 100 children at any one time or possibly 200 or 300 - I am sure the committee has the figures.  While not all of them will make it in, we might be looking at 300 or 400 children at the most in a year.  A well-resourced, well-trained advocacy service will be invaluable and, as I said, it will not just be for the children but for their families as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE32022012500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1643068800,"counter":246,"content":"<p>With regard to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2021, has Dr. Muldoon's office engaged with the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on that Bill?
