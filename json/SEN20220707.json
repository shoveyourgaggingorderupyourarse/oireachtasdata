We had a good discussion with the officials and I hoped that the Government would table amendments on Report Stage.  There had been some recognition that valid issues and concerns were raised.  I always prefer if the Government takes matters on board and brings forward its own proposals on issues.  Since I do not see Government amendments, I hope it will take on board some or all of the constructive Opposition amendments that have been tabled.<\/p> <p>It has been highlighted that the interpersonal grievance provisions in the Bill create not just ambiguity but danger.  There is the danger that persons who may have experienced bullying or harassment, or who may indeed have matters that are interpersonal grievance matters, may believe that because they are in that process, they do not have the option to bring forward a protected disclosure.  They may be told that and would not see anything in the Bill that would contradict that.<\/p> <p>The more serious danger is that, where if somebody has raised and highlighted matters of public concern that might in future become part of a protected disclosure, we might create a perverse incentive for a manager or employer to bully or harass people or push them into a position where they are part of an interpersonal grievance process and therefore feel they are constrained.  We know the intense levels of personal harassment, penalisation and bullying that have taken place with regard to whistleblowers.  We should not have anything in the Bill that potentially rewards or encourages that.  I have been assured that people can still make protected disclosures while they are undergoing a personal grievance process, but the Bill does not signal or inform people of that.  It sends a contrary signal.  I worry about the message it sends to the worker and to a manager or employer who may be engaged in wrongdoing.  There are two distinct dangers.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 1 from the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators seeks to address this issue.  I have tabled three amendments that seek to address it in different ways too.  I will go through them briefly.  Amendment No. 2 is an alternative to the previous amendment and would add a new subsection to clarify that a matter concerning an interpersonal grievance would be a relevant wrongdoing where it happens because somebody makes a protected disclosure or a dispute has come about because a person has made a protected disclosure and been penalised for doing so.  In its report, which I sat on during the extensive pre-legislative scrutiny, the committee stated that the inclusion of interpersonal grievance in the current way creates unnecessary risks that a legitimate protected disclosure of wrongdoing could be deliberately mischaracterised and miscategorised as being related to another matter.  The Bar of Ireland also highlighted the dangers of a lack of a proper definition of \"interpersonal grievances\" in the Bill.  Transparency International Ireland highlighted that the current wording could cause confusion.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 3 is related to amendment No. 2.  It states, \"The Minister shall, within 9 months of the passing of this Act, lay draft guidelines clarifying that engagement in a process relating to an interpersonal grievance does not preclude a person from making a protected disclosure.&rdquo;,&rdquo;.  This is the other mechanism where this might be done.  I always prefer for matters to be stated clearly in legislation but amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are secondary amendments.  If this route, using guidelines, is taken, it is important that information campaigns relating to protected disclosures clarify that a matter of interpersonal grievance should not preclude a person from making a protected disclosure in parallel and that people do not have to wait for the interpersonal grievance process to finish before they can make a protected disclosure.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Amendment No. 4 also relates to previous amendments.

There is a significant danger in the Bill and this could prevent it from working, and the issue was also discussed at length with the Minister of State's officials.  I urge him to accept at least one of the ways of addressing this that we have put forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#A00600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, all relate to the treatment of interpersonal grievances under the legislation.  I accept they were made in a constructive spirit and in an attempt to improve the legislation, and I accept the Senators' good intentions.  As was discussed previously, the purpose of both the Protected Disclosures Act and the whistleblowing directive is to protect people who report wrongdoing in the public interest.  Matters of private interest, such as personal grievances between a worker and his or her employer or a co-worker, lie outside the scope of this legislation and such matters are protected by the significant corpus of employment law, much of which existed for many decades before the Protected Disclosures Act.  It was never the intention the Act would be an alternative avenue for the airing of personal grievances but, as we discussed previously, there have been significant issues in this area, reflected not least in the concerns about the wording of the Act raised by the Supreme Court in the Baranya case.  For this reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 1 to section 5(5A) proposed by Senators Gavan and Boylan.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 2, tabled by Senators Higgins and Ruane, proposes that grievances that arise as a consequence of an act of penalisation against a whistleblower should be treated as protected disclosures.  This is not appropriate given it would require additional, parallel grievance systems to be established as part of an organisation's whistleblowing function, resulting in unnecessary cost and the duplication of effort.  It would also have the effect of blurring the lines between reports of wrongdoing, on the one hand, and allegations of penalisation, on the other, whereas it is essential these be treated separately when they arise.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 2.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 3 would provide that raising a grievance would not preclude a person from making a protected disclosure.  The conditions for making a protected disclosure are clearly set out in section 5 of the Protected Disclosures Act and in the amendments made by the Bill.  It is clear the raising of a grievance in no way prevents a person from being protected for also reporting a wrongdoing.  In particular, section 5(7) states, &ldquo;The motivation for making a disclosure is irrelevant to whether or not it is a protected disclosure.&rdquo;  I consider the amendment unnecessary and, as a result, I will not accept it.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 4 would provide that the Minister would issue guidelines in respect of the treatment of protected disclosures involving grievances.  Section 28 already provides that the Minister shall issue guidance in respect of the operation of the legislation.  The relationship between protected disclosures and grievances will be addressed comprehensively in this guidance.  The amendment, therefore, is unnecessary and I will not accept it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#B00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>This issue has had a lot of back and forth both in the D&aacute;il and here, as the Minister of State will be aware.

If, for example, there were to be an anonymous report of the release of toxic materials or of very significant financial wrongdoing, the employer, under the legislation, would not be required to accept that report.  There are measures whereby if a report is not valid or does not have substance, it does not need to be followed up.  The Bill as drafted, however, will mean the employer will not even have to accept the report, and that is an unacceptable level of deniability and avoidance of potential liability or follow-up action.<\/p> <p>As I said, the NUIG experts speaking during pre-legislative scrutiny made clear this was not in line with international best practice from the UK, the United States, the OECD, Transparency International and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's own guidelines.  Recommendation 20 from the committee stated there should be a legal requirement to accept anonymous reports of breaches and then to determine the follow-up on the same basis as that for other disclosures.  This is about ensuring people who feel they need to make an anonymous disclosure will be treated fairly but, more important, when people make these disclosures, it is not someone applying for something.  They are not getting anything or looking for something for themselves.  Without the amendment, the Bill will raise the bar.<\/p> <p>Protected disclosures are not an application process for a job.  It is a very risky, often personally dangerous, step people take when they make disclosures.  We have seen a litany of examples of the costs incurred to individuals.  Where they raise issues of public concern, the substance of those issues should be the central focus in determining whether action should be taken, not whether the person has made himself or herself appropriately vulnerable by tagging his or her name to it.  Again, these are not individuals seeking something for themselves but rather they are raising a red flag and highlighting an issue.  That a bar of vulnerability will be required before somebody could flag an issue will create cases where matters of serious public concern and possibly of public danger are not alerted because the bar will have been raised such that employers will be able to ignore the concern.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They will see in the Bill that raising it anonymously does not guarantee that it will even be accepted, let alone be looked at.  That is a concern.  That is a danger in the Bill that has been highlighted strongly.  There is evidence to show that the way the Bill deals with this is inadequate.  It is a concern that may prevent people from disclosing serious wrongdoings.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 6 is based on the conversations that I have had with officials.  These were conversations that I had in good faith, believing that the Government was looking to see how it could strengthen and improve the Bill.  The point was made that people can make a disclosure through the protected disclosure commissioner.  However, many people will not be aware of that fact.  I have asked about it.  I genuinely believed that we had some agreement.  Even in the Chamber, the Minister of State seemed to acknowledge the validity of the point.  If a person is not going to accept an anonymous report themselves, he or she should at least make every due effort to ensure that the person who is making the disclosure is aware that he or she can make that protected disclosure directly to a commissioner.<\/p><p>This is a signposting mechanism.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, recently took it on, in relation to the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022.  In that Bill, there was the idea that where information would not be provided, persons would be provided with a signpost to the correct channel whereby they could seek redress or information.  Amendment No. 6 is a similar signposting amendment.  It relates to where a person receives an anonymous report but does not want to accept it.  It says that they should, where it is possible to do so, for example, in the case where they have received an email, \"respond to the reporting person and inform them of their right to make a protected disclosure to the Commissioner.&rdquo;.\"<\/p><p>This is a signposting amendment.  It is a very low ask.  I would ask that the Minister of State would accept it.  It would simply say that if persons are not accepting the disclosure, where it is possible to do so, because it will not always be the case, they make reasonable efforts to direct the person towards the other channel for making a report that may be available to them.  That is a minimum.  This is not the case of an individual who is losing an opportunity that this is weighing against a report being considered.  These are unknowable matters of public concern that the Minister of State is weighing against a person not processing, or to consider processing, an anonymous complaint.  The scales are heavily tipped towards us in considering matters that are made as protected disclosures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#B01600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins raised a number of important queries.

One could argue that if all anonymous complaints were being treated with the same level, and if they were all automatically being pursued, that would increase the level of anonymous complaints and there may be more vexatious complaints, on the one hand.  On the other hand, and this is particularly in smaller organisations, it would provide greater protection to the persons making a complaint if the right to anonymity in that the anonymous complaint were to be automatically pursued.  This is particularly the case in smaller organisations, where a person might be more easily identifiable.<\/p> <p>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  There are valid issues here in relation to the whole area of anonymity.

This is provided for in section 7 of the Bill.  Article 6(4) provides that it is up to member states to decide if recipients should be required by law to accept and follow up on anonymous reports.  In transposing this article, I have decided to preserve, as much as possible, the principle in the 2014 Act that allows recipients to exercise their own judgment as to how or whether to follow up.  Nothing in this provision of the Bill prohibits workers from making anonymous reports.  Indeed, section 19 of the Bill requires that recipients keep records of anonymous reports, whether or not they are accepted for follow up, in case of penalisation if the individual&rsquo;s identity becomes known. <\/p> <p>I do not see what amendment No. 5 adds to the legislation here.

It is regrettable that we are choosing to say that they do not have to be accepted.<\/p> <p>On the question of vexatious complaints, there are already filters to say that it is accepted.  There is a question as to whether it needs to be followed up.  The person does so if there is merit in doing so.  There are many filters that allow for that already.  The issue of vexatious complaints is not really a concern.<\/p> <p>The public has seen the experience of whistleblowers in the media again and again and again.  When people make a protected disclosure their life gets blown up, they get penalised, their family is targeted and there are all of the other things that have happened that people have seen.  There is a huge set of measures and disincentives to making protected disclosures.  I know that there are provisions for the public information that would encourage people to make them again.  However, why are we demanding that people experience that vulnerability?  This is like looking for a pound of flesh from persons who are already doing something as a public service, whereby there is no benefit to them and only a cost to them.  This says that they also have to put their name on the line.  This is even potentially the case in very small organisations and in very small towns where there are limited opportunities for employment and where the rest of one's family may work.<\/p> <p>Let us think of the real places where this happens.  People could be in a small town, wherein there are maybe two places in which they can work doing what they do.  They are required to put their name out there in making a disclosure.  Yes, there are protections from penalisation, but they are onerous.  It is a long process, and they are certainly no substitute for having one's life functioning fully.  The amounts are nothing when compared with the costs and risks that are taken.<\/p> <p>We have created a situation whereby, sadly, in the next few years we will see some terrible situation.  It will then be a case of, \"Why was nothing done about it?&rdquo;  The situation will be that a disclosure had been made, that somebody was emailed, that somebody was told, that he or she did not accept that disclosure and that it was not followed up.  We will have created a chain of deniability for people, because they will not have to accept, act on or investigate the substance of a matter that was made as a protected disclosure to a person who was in a position to investigate it, to act upon it and to perhaps stop the dangerous situation.  The fact that they have a file stating that the received an email will not be sufficient.  We are creating a situation whereby we will be letting companies off the hook for actions that are potentially extremely damaging to the public.  I know we will see that case down the line, sadly.  That will be a choice that we have made.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has outlined this really clearly.  It is a choice.  The directive said that we can choose to accept anonymous disclosures.  I would note that it is particularly egregious for a country as small Ireland to not accept anonymous disclosures.  This is a country where most people are living in smaller places.  They do not have huge numbers of options for employment that would be comparable to some of the other countries that are transposing these directives.  This is the wrong decision.  It is a mistake.  There is the failure to even provide an arrow to persons.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->People will make a report and may not even signal it fully and properly as being a protected disclosure, but it is a matter that is such.

As the Minister of State will know, I have a keen interest in public procurement.  Part of the quality criteria we have discussed in this House is how a company treats it workers, and general issues of quality and good practice.  If the Government gives public contracts to companies, it is very important there are proper internal reporting channels to ensure there are necessary and appropriate safeguards for workers who wish to highlight a matter of concern.  This is very important because we are not simply talking about a company but public money, and due diligence, due process and due care being given in respect of public money.  We know there are situations where companies with a very small number of employees may have responsibilities relating to very large amounts of public money.  In those contexts, it is very important such companies have internal reporting channels.<\/p> <p>During the previous discussion, the Minister of State outlined the small but very important measures that are the difference between having a proper internal reporting channel and simply sending an email.  For example, on the question of there being specific emails and specific guarantees of confidentiality, a number of practical mechanisms are involved in having a proper internal reporting channel.  The Minister of State himself made the case for how important these were in giving greater confidence to workers who make a disclosure.<\/p> <p>If a public contract is worth more than &euro;3 million, we would all want to know whether something is up and whether there is an issue that merits a disclosure.  It is very important - amendment No. 8 references this and makes it very clear - that under section 8(4), where the Minister can make orders relating to particular areas of high risk, there are exceptions to the employee thresholds.  Amendment No. 8 states the Minister should, when he is making such orders, \"have regard to the need to ensure that companies [who are] performing high value public contracts ... [should have] internal reporting channels regardless of the number of employees they have\".<\/p> <p>This was an issue I discussed with the Department.  I had thought there was a degree of recognition of it.  In the previous debate, the Minister of State seemed to recognise there was merit in this argument.  I had expected a Government amendment in respect of this.  I hope the Government will, at a minimum, signal its intention to make orders in respect of this matter, even if it does not accept my amendments requiring it to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#E01100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  Amendment No. 7 removes the 50-employee threshold for employers performing a public contract with a value of more than &euro;3 million.

I am not accepting this amendment.<\/p> <p>As discussed on Committee Stage, the impact of such an amendment needs careful consideration and evaluation to ensure we are not distorting the market for the provision of public services and putting some organisations, especially smaller companies and not-for-profit organisations, at a disadvantage during procurement competitions.  I am very concerned that accepting this amendment could have unintended consequences.  I will draw the Senator&rsquo;s attention to section 6(6) of the Act, as amended by this Bill, which, when enacted, will allow the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to set lower thresholds for the establishment of internal channels on certain employers or certain classes of employers.  If a business case can be made for applying this to public contracts of a certain value, as proposed by the Senator, this is the best mechanism by which this can be achieved.<\/p> <p>I note amendment No. 8 proposes something along these lines.

I also draw the Senator's attention to section 6(1)(b) of the Act which provides that where a worker reasonably believes that a wrongdoing relates solely or mainly to the conduct of a person other than the worker's employer or to something for which a person other than the worker's employer has legal responsibility, the worker can report to that other person, and if these conditions are met, a worker whose employer has a contract with a public body should be able to raise his or her concerns with that public body if the worker so wishes.  Furthermore, it is open to the Minister under section 6(7), as inserted by this Bill, to provide that employers open their reporting channels to persons other than employees.  Consideration will be given to doing this in respect of persons and organisations that are contracted by public bodies.<\/p><p>Taking all this into account, I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#E01200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>There are some positive elements in what the Minister of State said, and there are also matters that remain a concern.  I note positively the two final points that were made and I request that they be made clear in the public information campaigns that will come with this legislation.  The widening of the right to make reports beyond workers is very important, for example, in situations which the Minister of State signalled.  Where a contract is given for the provision of a public service, the persons receiving that public service via a party contracted by the State should certainly be empowered if they need to signal a matter.  We know there have been situations where what a public body or a Department has been informed is happening is not what is happening in some areas.  For example, some of the contracts in direct provision have been signals and situations whereby serious matters of concern have been highlighted by those persons receiving services from a contracted party.<\/p> <p>It is also useful, and I again ask that this be part of the public information campaign, that the Minister of State has made it clear that if a public body has contracted for a service to a company, an individual should be able to make the protected disclosure directly to the public body.  This is consistent with the public duty in equality and human rights which applies to public bodies and Departments.  They remain responsible even when they have contracted various services to contracting providers.  The core responsibility for ensuring compliance with the public duty in equality and human rights remains with the public body, so it is consistent with that.  It is going to be very important to signal that, especially as sometimes those who are contracted to deliver services can be large multinationals where it is hard to identify the relevant persons.  The important thing is that it is public money that is being spent in that way.<\/p> <p>Those are useful factors, but I am still concerned about the decision not to guarantee the powers under the Bill.  My amendment is not simply to try to add a new power; it is trying to ensure that the power the Minister of State has outlined, the power to specify certain companies or categories of companies, would be used in respect of public contracts.  That is very important.  We talked about the dangers of disadvantaging.  To be clear, when we choose not to put these measures in we are, in fact, specifically disadvantaging companies that do the right thing.  If our public procurement does not put a value on best practices or even a requirement to have them, such as a due diligence process for internal reporting of any matters that may be of concern, for example, with regard to how that money is spent, and when we do not have those processes in place and we do not reward or recognise the importance of having those processes in place, we effectively reward those companies that choose not to spend money and that have less overheads as a result.  That goes across an entire set of quality criteria.  Not having quality criteria that include this criterion, which is a measure of quality, is not the neutral position.  Not having that is a disadvantaging of those companies that endeavour to do the right thing and put their resources into best practice and due diligence.<\/p> <p>The largest customer in the State, the largest contractor and the most spent on public procurement by any body in the State is the State.  We set the tone for what matters and what is expected and for high standards and proper risk management.  This is a risk management measure that should be in place in any company that gets a public contract.  I note my amendments do not deal with small contracts but with large contracts of over &euro;3 million in public money, which is certainly entering the point of significant amount.<\/p> <p>I am glad of some of the points the Minister of State has made and I hope they will be reflected in the public information campaign.  However, I am particularly disappointed that amendment No. 8 has not been accepted.  I will withdraw amendment No. 7 but I will press amendment No. 8.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#F00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 14, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(6A) In making an order under subsection (4), the Minister shall have regard to the need to ensure that companies performing high value public contracts establish internal reporting channels regardless of the number of employees they have.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#F00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#F00500","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

It has been strongly argued that there is a danger that this effectively falls out of line with the directive in that it represents a regressive move whereby there is a lessening of rights in a certain area for whistleblowers as a result of this legislation.  Whistleblowers and civil society groups have highlighted that under the new section 8 it is proposed that public servants be required to report to their employer in most circumstances, removing the automatic right of public servants to make a disclosure directly to a Minister.<\/p> <p>There is a danger whereby disclosures may be captured or disappeared within the hierarchy of an employment system and within the power dynamics of that system when it may be a matter of quite significant national concern that should be allowed to be disclosed directly to a Minister.  It dilutes existing legal protections for public servants in terms of prosecution, penalisation or detriment if they have made a disclosure directly to a Minister.  The fact that they have made a disclosure directly to a Minister means they may not have the same protections under this Bill.  There is a danger therefore not just in terms of the route not being open but also that many people will not be aware of the steps they would have needed to have taken, and people may make what they believe to be a protected disclosure but not have the appropriate protections in place.<\/p> <p>Many whistleblowers who are motivated to make a disclosure do so out of public concern and for the public interest.  In doing so they should not face a situation where they effectively find themselves excluded from some of the provisions or protections of the legislation.  Many of them will never read the legislation.  They will simply know that the matter is important and they will decide to inform a Minister.  It could be either a Minister directly responsible in that area or it might be the Minister as the senior representative of the Government in a whistleblower's geographical area who the whistleblower knows.  They will go to our chosen elected decision makers at the highest level to highlight a matter that may be of public concern.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->When they see something that matters in an area of expertise or concern, they want to highlight it.  There is a danger that persons who go directly to a Minister, having not gone to an employer, may not activate protections.  Transparency International Ireland has highlighted concerns about this section, specifically that it may breach the non-regression clause in Article 25.2 of the 2019 directive and that that marks a step backwards in protections for whistleblowers.  Transparency International Ireland has written to the Minister of State on this and has outlined that whistleblowers will continue to report directly to Ministers.  That will continue to happen regardless of what is in the legislation because it is established practice and precedent and because, when people make a disclosure, they are not acting as employees.  It is not in their job description.  They are doing so as citizens.  Their awareness of the issue arises because they are workers and they are vulnerable to penalisation because they are workers, but raising the flag of concern is taking a step beyond anything that is required of them in their job.  They are doing that as citizens.  They go to those they have elected and those who are responsible at the highest level, who were chosen by the public as their public representatives and chosen by the Oireachtas as Governments and Ministers.  It makes sense that people would go to a Minister.  They will continue to do so but there is a real danger they will not have proper protections and that they will fall between stools so their disclosure does not get processed or a reason is given for why it was not properly accepted.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 would insert new criteria where someone can report directly to a Minister in certain situations.  I have spoken about the general removal of that clause but these amendments are a result of engagement and listening very closely on Committee Stage.  These are constructive proposals to ameliorate the damage of removing that direct line.  I am disappointed the Government has not brought its own amendments on these matters because there are a number of practical proposals here, on some of which I thought we had made progress.  Amendment No. 9 would simply introduce criteria stating people can report directly to a Minister in situations where they reasonably believe their own manager or the head of a public body is complicit in the wrongdoing.  The bar for reporting directly to a Minister in this legislation is insanely high.  People can report if they believe the head of a public body is directly involved in the wrongdoing.  People working downstream in the HSE may never know the head of the organisation.  They may never meet the head of the HSE or have any idea what he or she is doing.  Employees in a Department may never know or be aware of the Secretary General, let alone be confident the Secretary General is involved in wrongdoing.  What they might know, however, is their own direct manager is involved in wrongdoing or the person to whom they report is complicit in wrongdoing or a matter of public concern.  They may be able to see that several layers of management are involved.  They are not allowed go to the Minister unless they somehow have proof the head of the organisation is involved.  That is too high a bar.  These are very large bodies in some cases.<\/p><p>This is a sensible amendment.  It simply states people can go to a Minister if their manager or the persons to whom they report are involved.  If someone has no personal contact with their manager's manager, how can they have confidence in going to the manager's manager?  They may be involved but the person just will not know.  If the persons to whom an employee reports are involved in the wrongdoing, the employee should be able to go to a Minister.  We should not have this extremely high bar of the head of a public body.  If you know there is rot two levels up, you may assume it is further on, whether or not you know it.  In that regard, it is too high a bar to limit that exception to the head of a public body.  I ask that it be changed to the person's own manager.  That fear of penalisation and consequences comes in, especially when reporting on a matter relating to your own manager.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 10 would allow a person to go directly to a Minister that if a person does not feel confident making a report under sections 6, 7 or 8 due to the reasonable fear of penalisation.  Such a person may have seen consequences or penalisation for others who sought to flag the issue.  They may have seen others lose their jobs because of it.  Sometimes it is only after someone has lost his or her job that his or her colleagues learn why that was.  If there is a reasonable fear of penalisation, people should be able to go directly to a Minister.  This amendment does not remove all the issues but it would make the section less regressive and would give some additional protection to whistleblowers.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 relate to worrying, strange and undefined language in this Bill in the caveats around matters of public concern.  Amendment No. 11 removes the phrase \"an imminent or manifest\" from before \"danger\".  Surely if a matter is of danger to the public interest, that should be enough.  Why are we adding that it must be imminent?  What does imminent mean in this context?  It is a case of how near is the comet?  Does imminent mean something that will have effect next week, next year, in two years or in five years?  Having a bar of imminent and manifest is effectively saying people should not bother the Minister with a matter that is just of danger to the public.  It may be a matter that is substantially dangerous to the public.  It may be a matter where we would like to get in as early as possible.  Does a whistleblower need to wait until it is almost too late before he or she is allowed to raise an issue with the Minister?  That is what the legislation says, rather than, as we should do and as is prudent, rewarding and encouraging early action as soon as the danger to the public is recognised and identified.<\/p><p>There are other examples of language in the Bill that is designed to intimidate and discourage persons from making disclosures to Ministers.  That is the only way this can be read.  It is dissuasive language trying to make people not come to Ministers with disclosures, meaning Ministers can say they do not need to take something on board.  One example is the phrase \"such as where there is an emergency situation or a risk of irreversible damage\".  The legislation is saying we are okay with damage.  I do not know how this passes the Comptroller and Auditor General's standards as legislation.  It is saying that if the issue is something that can be fixed later, even if that might cost money or if there may be casualties to a degree, if it is reversible damage we should let the damage happen and come back afterwards.  It is only where it is irreversible damage, even though reversing that damage may have a huge public and human cost, that people can go to the Minister.  It is extraordinary we are basically telling people not to bother the Minister with big problems if we can fix them later.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is really weird language and it should not be in the Bill.  I have discussed this and raised it.  When the other Minister spoke, he said he did not want to create anything that might result in a chilling effect.  This language clearly will.  Setting such a high bar really underscores the fact that this section is regressive and in breach of Article 25(2) of the EU directive in its measures.  <\/p><p>When this was being discussed, what was highlighted again and again was that there had been a problem in the previous legislation whereby persons reported to the Ministers but there was no clear line as to what the Ministers would then do with those reports.  There are other measures in the Bill that address that issue but, to be very clear, the problem was never the fact that persons made disclosures to Ministers but that there was no clear process to be followed afterwards.  There is now a clear process.<\/p><p>Most people will make a disclosure to a Minister, the person who is politically responsible and who is their representative on matters of public decision-making.  That Minister will then end up sending them a letter to say that he or she has referred their complaint to the protected disclosures commissioner, who will process it and then may send it on.  If a person has made a disclosure to a Minister who is geographically nearby, that Minister may send it on to the commissioner who will then send it on to the appropriate Minister.  There is a process there.<\/p><p>The problem was always what happens next.  It does not mean that every Minister has to deal with disclosures.  They can pass them on to the right person or body to be dealt with.  However, they should be able to receive it.  The problem was never receiving it.  There is no case for making it so difficult to report to a Minister.  It may well be that the Minister is not the person who processes the report but, as a receiving point, the Minister is a really crucial resource for any person employed as a public servant who cares about the public interest and who wants to raise an issue of danger to the public.  To close off and limit that channel in the way this section does is an extraordinarily regressive and unnecessary step.  It is dealing with a problem that does not exist because the problem was always what happens next.  That is dealt with elsewhere.  I am not trying to change that because it is being dealt with elsewhere.   I again urge the Minister of State to consider and take on board these amendments.<\/p><p>I want to check that I have covered all of the grouping.  Does it end with amendment No. 12 or with No. 13?  It ends with amendment No. 13.  I have not spoken to No. 13 yet.  I will be very brief.  This is again a simple amendment.  It seeks to ensure that, where a Minister of the Government transmits a report to the protected disclosures commissioner, that Minister will notify the reporting person that he or she has done so.  That is again a simple thing about the process of passing reports on.  It again clarifies and builds on the fact that we have solved the problem of what happens next.  The Bill tries to do that.  This would just make sure that reporting persons are aware that this is the new process as to what happens next so that they do not expect the individual Minister to continue to respond regarding the detail of the substantive matter.  If the report has been passed on to the protected disclosures commissioner, the whistleblower will be let know that is who they should follow up with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#F01000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 9 is interesting in the context of this section.  The section provides that a worker may make a report to the relevant Minister if one or more of a list of given conditions are met.  It then goes on to talk about the head of the public body.  To use the example of a Department, the Secretary General would be in charge.  If an assistant secretary has engaged in wrongdoing, is the worker precluded from writing to the Minister?  I know the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer and is in charge of the Department but assistant secretaries and principal officers also have roles.  Why does the section refer only to the head of the body?  It is just a matter of terminology?  Is it legalese?  Does the head of the Department really mean the full Department?  That is not my reading of the section.  It is a valid question.

I will start with amendments Nos. 9 to 12, inclusive.  Each of these amendments widens the qualifiers for ministerial disclosure to such an extent as to significantly dilute the requirement to report in the first instance to either the employer or the prescribed person before reporting to the Minister.  This is not in line with the policy intent.<\/p> <p>The operation of the ministerial channel has been one of the most challenging areas in the implementation of the Act so far.   The intent behind the provision of a ministerial channel under the Act was that, in the event that a public body failed to deal properly with an internal report, a worker in that public body would have the fallback option of reporting to the Minister.<\/p> <p>In practice, there has been a tendency for reporting persons to either go to the Minister first or to report simultaneously to both their employer and the Minister.  This practice of simultaneous or near simultaneous reporting through different channels was raised as a concern by the disclosures tribunal, which recommended that the Oireachtas consider amending the legislation so that, when a report is made, the initial recipient is afforded a reasonable amount of time to take action before the reporting person moves on to an alternative channel.<\/p> <p>Furthermore, Article 7 of the directive requires member states to encourage reporting internally in the first instance.  The introduction of a requirement that the reporting person should report using one of the other channels first is intended to address this issue.  Disclosures will be transmitted to appropriate bodies for assessment and follow up. For these reasons, I am not accepting these amendments.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 13 requires Ministers to notify the reporting person of the transmission of a report to the commissioner.  Section 10D(1)(a) already requires that the commissioner issues an acknowledgement when he or she receives the report.  This ensures that reporting persons are informed of what has happened to their report and who is taking responsibility for it.  As a result, I do not accept this amendment and do not see the need for it. <\/p> <p>Article 25(2) of the directive provides that, \"The implementation of this Directive shall under no circumstances constitute grounds for a reduction in the level of protection already afforded by Member States in the areas covered by this Directive\".  This matter was raised by a Senator who was concerned that we might be reducing the protections afforded.  In literal terms, this does not outright prevent a member state from reducing the level of protection already afforded but rather provides that the directive shall not \"constitute grounds\" for such a reduction.  In other words, no member state can rely on the directive as a justification for reducing the protection and, in particular, for contending that a greater protection is inconsistent with the directive.  However, that is very different from preventing a member state reducing the level of protection for policy reasons, provided no reliance on the directive is cited in that regard.<\/p> <p>We are not changing the rules concerning ministerial disclosures because of the directive; we are changing them for the simple reason that this channel is not working as intended in its present form.  In many ways, we are strengthening and professionalising the ministerial channel by providing that ministerial disclosures will be referred to an independent expert in the form of the protected disclosures commissioner.<\/p> <p>On the question of what the head of a public body is, it is the head of a public body rather than a deputy or the entire organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#H00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I have great respect for the Minister of State but his speech is extraordinary.  It basically says that we are lowering the protections but are not using the directive to do so.  Given Ireland's record on whistleblowers and given that the whole idea is that we are meant to be improving things, delivering a speech that basically admits that we are lowering protections, although we are not using the directive to justify this, and reading out a whole section of the directive to demonstrate that it is okay to lower the protections as long as the directive is not used to do so sends an incredibly bad message, not to mention being a massive contradiction in itself.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Perhaps some self-examination is needed at the Department.  It appears to be a case of being allowed to do this versus it being entirely against the whole spirit of what we are supposed to be doing, and against what everybody is saying this legislation is about.  This is very surprising to me.  I do believe it is lowering the protections but I did not expect this to be acknowledged so clearly.<\/p><p>To be clear, the directive has been used in that the line in terms of encouraging reports to be made in other ways and so forth, which again is in the directive, has been directly quoted as one of the rationales for this section.  Again, even that argument does not stand up.<\/p><p>I also note that the directive asked that we would encourage people to report to various other channels.  It did not give a mandate for people to discourage.  This is a real problem in Ireland.  There is a thing in Ireland whereby people do not trust reporting to their managers because their experience has been that it goes horribly wrong.  How can we encourage them to be confident to report to their employers or to their managers?  How can we build a culture in the public service that encourages that?  This would involve, for example, measures around having proper internal channels and having stronger protections against penalisation.  Perhaps it might involve three or four high-profile examples where somebody actually blows a whistle and does not have a horrible time.  That would be great and it would be encouraging.  It might encourage people to come forward to their managers.  Instead of trying to encourage people to be confident in using a mechanism that has failed them, we try to discourage them from the mechanism which, as the Minister of State himself has outlined, is exactly what people use.<\/p><p>Is the goal of the legislation for there to be fewer protected disclosures or for there to be more?  The goal should be for there to be more so we learn about problems earlier and better, and that people are confident in bringing forward protected disclosures on issues.  The main channel people have been using has been clearly stated as the channel of people going to a Minister.  I could list off these cases but I do not like to drag individual examples in.  The issues that have been highlighted to us by whistleblowers have been very important.  They have related to massive amounts of public money.  They have related to significant breaches of human rights.  They are very important issues.  Yet, we are trying to discourage people from using the channel that everybody uses.  In his response, the Minister of State did not address the danger that people will still probably use this channel because it is the one that makes sense to people.  The idea should be to try to ensure there is no wrong door, and that if a person goes to a Minister, although he or she should go to somebody else, that person gets redirected, not that he or she gets blocked from going to a Minister.  There is a danger that people will go to the Minister and, again, the issue will not get treated properly or in a proper way because the person did not go to the employer first.  There is also the danger the person may not have access to protections under the Bill.  That is a very serious danger.<\/p><p>We know what actually happens and works.  We have chosen not to address it.  The problem had always been the Minister knowing what to do with that.  That was solved elsewhere.  There is no solution in this.  This is a discouragement of whistleblowing through the channel that is most often used.  It is a diminution and a regression in the protections for whistleblowers, as acknowledged, and it is a regressive step in that regard.  It is a real pity and I am very surprised because while I did expect that the general principle might not be addressed, it was my expectation that some of the very extreme language around \"imminent\" and \"irreversible\" would have been addressed.

We know, however, that the problem is that getting interim feedback every few years for a decade can for many people make it feel as though their life is a little bit suspended.  Investigations can last for years and sometimes they can be prolonged for years.  Sometimes investigations can be obstructed, which makes them last for years.  It puts whistleblowers through a lot of trauma in many cases.  It is important that when an investigation goes on for longer than two years, there would be an explanation as to why that is the case.

They have been involved in the investigation of the matter or, in one case I know of, one such person was required to sign off on payment for penalisation.  These are the persons about whom the disclosures were made and who had been engaged in wrongdoing.  It is worrying that we sometimes see this.  It is one of the reasons people often go, especially since we do not have provisions to go round in the Bill, to Ministers.  They know their senior managers are not to be trusted on the matter.  In this case, they may go to the commissioner and so forth but we do not want that the commissioner then sends it over to the Department and it somehow ends up back on the desk of the person it is about.  If a person is named in a protected disclosure, that person should not have any power in the investigation of that disclosure.  It is a basic but important point.  If it cannot be addressed through this amendment, I urge that it be addressed through guidelines or other provisions in the Bill.  That is a danger and has occurred in the investigation of matters and in persons seeking compensation for penalisation.

One of the only serious penalties outlined here is that people face a threat of prosecution if they give false information.  Determining what is knowingly giving false information will be difficult because people hear information and then hear other information.  People are sometimes fed information which they believe to be true.  There may be contradictions in terms of a whistleblower in that, having raised an issue, other issues may be brought to them.  Sometimes, people make a disclosure about three issues which are true and correct and one which may not be correct but which they have added in because they have come to believe that anything is possible in their organisation.  They may do so in good faith.<\/p><p>There is the danger of a chill effect in the potential creation of a case for prosecution against a whistleblower accused of knowingly using false information, yet there is no equivalent threat of prosecution for a person who gives false information in respect of the whistleblower.

Measures in this Bill linger from an old Act and  which applies to everything in Ireland where we treat the person raising the alarm as the problem or danger.  It reminds me of birth information tracing, where the person seeking the information was the difficult person to be managed.

That should be signalled as being as strong a concern in this Bill as the equivalent.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 17 provides that the Minister will, after the Bill has passed, &quot;hold an accessible public information campaign in respect of the role of whistleblow[ers] in the advancement of the public good ...

This is a very important recommendation from the Irish Council of Civil Liberties and it was a key recommendation from our committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  It is important across this House that we know the importance of whistleblowing and the public service whistleblowers have given the country, often at great personal and professional cost.  We need to make sure the public are aware of this contribution, know how to make a disclosure, are, most important, empowered and encouraged when they see wrongdoing to report it, and know they will be supported and protected in doing so.<\/p><p>I have outlined over the course of this debate a number of factors that need to be reflected in that public information campaign.  The core one is that this goes against a strong culture against speaking out on these issues.  This is not somebody taking vindictive actions; it is not mean.  It is somebody speaking for the public good and is a contribution to that good.  We should highlight the benefits accrued to the State, sometimes difficult benefits which involve facing up to problems and bad practices, having to admit we are wrong and having to change.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is a good process for the State or a public body to undergo.

However, as discussed, the inclusion of a legislative amendment in this regard is unnecessary and disproportionate.  I will not accept the amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#L00150","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I support Senator Higgins on the importance of the information campaign being clear and explanatory.

In some cases, the person may not even be aware of the legislation.  The reason I regret that the amendments concerning managers were not accepted is that it is often people at a lower level in organisations who have a strong personal ethical sense.  That comes at every level and there have been cases involving cleaning, caring or catering staff.  People who are on the front line of service delivery may become aware of very significant issues around practices that have significant implications for the wider operation of an organisation.  There are lots of different ways and means.  The determinant factor seems to be that people have a strong ethical sense of what is good practice.  It should not be something that becomes only accessible for those who can seek legal advice or have access to persons who can help them navigate the legislation.  We must ensure this legislation is made accessible and clear.  It is not enough that it would be digital only because 40% of persons in Ireland do not have access to basic digital skills.  It is important, therefore, that people can get this information from a Citizens Information centre and elsewhere.  The information must be clear and widely accessible.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State indicated there will be an information campaign but he will not accept the amendment.  When designing the campaign I encourage him to consider engaging with the civil society organisations I mentioned and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  As he will be aware, the committee has taken a very strong interest in this area.  This was an important recommendation made by the committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny.  Members of the committee would appreciate an opportunity to have an input into the public information campaign.<\/p> <p>Accessibility, including language accessibility, is very important and fundamental.  It is important that the campaign is not framed in such a way that it sets out what people are allowed to do and how they can make a disclosure.  It must be framed in terms of the public good and the desire of organisations and public bodies to be informed when there is a problem.  That is important in shifting mindsets and takes the focus off the individual.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#L00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#L00600","speaker":"1637"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":99,"content":"<p>That is why people should be allowed to make an anonymous disclosure and focus on where it should be, which is on the subject matter that is being raised.

I start by sympathising with the families of former councillors Jerry O'Dea and James Tobin, who very sadly passed away over the last two weeks.  We, in Fianna F&aacute;il, are bereft at the loss of two very fine public representatives.  They were the epitome of good public service in society and in their communities in Limerick and in Waterford.  I extend our condolences to their family and friends and to the wider community.  Their loss will be greatly felt.<\/p> <p>With all that is happening here and abroad over the last week, sometimes we have to refocus on issues that shock us to the core and raise them in the House.  For me this week, the issue was the story about organ incineration and the realisation that the organs of 18 babies delivered at Cork University Maternity Hospital had been sent to Belgium in 2020 along with clinical waste, without the knowledge or consent of bereaved parents.  We can only begin to imagine what those parents went through on hearing this and trying to comprehend the situation.  The HSE's own standards state when organs are retained post mortem hospitals should support the family in one of two ways, either by facilitating the return of the organs to the family or arranging their sensitive disposal, by burial or cremation only, on behalf of the family.  This clearly did not happen.  The HSE was to provide a report in November 2021.  To date, we have not seen it.  We have to get that report and have it expedited.<\/p> <p>I also raise the issue of inclusive transport.  Access to public and personal transport to access work, education and social and recreational activities is important to every one of us but for people who are already isolated by their disability, it is twice as important.  It is shocking that the then Government closed the motorised transport grant and mobility allowance schemes in 2013 and never replaced them.  We must have a debate on this.  I know the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, has put a group together to look at this.  We also need flexibility around the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme to support people with disability and to provide access.  The current scheme is far too narrow.<\/p> <p>I have just come from a presentation in Buswells Hotel by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which does incredible work on behalf of the 64,000 people with dementia and their families in Ireland.  The organisation urgently needs funding to address rising needs.  As it states, dementia cannot wait.  I sat and listened to advocates like Mr. Kevin Quaid's wife, Helena, talk about the difference home support services would make.  It would add so much quality to their lives and the lives of their families.  They also spoke about that really important sense of valuing carers, including carers who come into the home.  It is very important we look for support for the Alzheimer Society of Ireland's request and send a very strong message to the Minister.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, is very supportive of this organisation but we also need to put pressure on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#Q00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I welcome the launch of the report of the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  Equality for all of our children, regardless of the manner of their birth, is something I have championed and I am very grateful for the extremely hard work of the committee, with cross-party support, that achieved an outcome that relies on two strands.  First, for all future surrogacies, parents intending to pursue international surrogacy must receive a certification to proceed from the Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority in order to apply for a parental order.  This requires preconception proofs that ensure the well-being and safeguarding of the surrogate, the children and the parents.  The international feedback today is that the framework suggested for Ireland could go on to form the foundation of a future international convention because it relies so much on the Verona Principles.<\/p> <p>The second strand contains retrospective provisions for children already born by surrogacy to ensure they have the protections of the full legal relationship with both of their parents in accordance with their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.<\/p> <p>The report is an extraordinary piece of work that honours the concerns that arise from international surrogacy, and overcomes them, and now needs to be become part of the assisted human reproduction legislation.

There was an attempt to characterise one member of the committee as being a victim.<\/p><p>I will refer to something that occurred in public yesterday, which I can refer to and which does not breach any confidentiality in this House.  There was a room full of witnesses at the committee, including women who have overcome serious illnesses, who live with cystic fibrosis, who have overcome cancer and who have experienced miscarriage and infant loss, and men who have experienced a lifetime of discrimination because of their sexual orientation.  They all love and adore their children and have testified in many forums in this country about how much they honour the precious women who gave birth to their children.  Those people who have overcome grief, loss and discrimination were termed as \"purchasers\" in an attempt to bring shame on them, to stigmatise them and to stigmatise Irish children, citizens and members of this Republic.  That is what happened in public.  I want Senators to consider for a moment what might have gone on in private and then tell me who the bully and the victim are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#Q00400","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I want to say the following on today's proposed Order of Business.  Yesterday, the Seanad Independent Group and others on this side of the House protested against the unnecessary use of the guillotine during a parliamentary debate.  Today, we want to register once again our protest regarding what is proposed in next week's draft schedule of business.  The first item for discussion today is a motion which effectively imposes the guillotine right across next week and it is to be done without debate.  The only opportunity that is being given to anybody in this House to speak on the necessity or the wisdom of doing so is during the Order of Business.  I protest that.  The widespread misuse of the guillotine to rush legislation through before the summer recess is a result of Government mismanagement of the time available in this House.  There has been no attempt whatsoever to discuss or agree these proposals with the leaders and Whips of the one third of this House who are effectively being bulldozed by the other two thirds to agree to the passage of legislation in a hurried way, without adequate time for scrutiny or amendment, which is our constitutional function as Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>More time is required for certain legislation next week.  For instance, the Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022 warrants more than one hour of debate on Second Stage, as does the mica remediation legislation.  On the other hand, business which will not reach Report and Final Stages next week and could be scheduled for the autumn, such as Senator Ward's National Lottery (Amendment) Bill and a Green Party Bill about animal welfare, which is not urgent, is now being slotted in to take up time which could be allocated to the other legislation proposed to be dealt with next week.  Likewise, resumption of Committee Stage of the Air Navigation and Transport Bill could wait until September, as could Second Stage of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022.<\/p> <p>I also object to one of the provisions proposed in this rubber-stamp motion.  If an emergency arises next week, nobody will even be able to ask for it to be debated in this House because Standing Order 30 is to be suspended by this motion.  We are to gag ourselves.  No matter what happens, we are gagged.  We cannot raise any issue at all under Standing Order 30.  We have never used that provision, but this is part of the procedure to rush everything through that is being dealt with today.  I have to oppose the Order of Business.  I cannot do otherwise.  I ask the Leader why Senator Boyhan and I, and the leaders of other groups not in the Government coalition, have not been consulted about any of this.  Why has communication collapsed to the point that we are driven to protesting about the imposition of such a motion?  I will leave it at that.<\/p> <p>I do not want to go back over affairs from yesterday, but there was less than full frankness in the description of how the Higher Education Authority Bill was dealt with.  We are opposed to this motion.  It is a gagging motion and a motion for multiple guillotines.  I cannot see why it is necessary to curtail debate on many important Bills and yet make provision for the Green Party to talk about animal welfare and for Senator Ward's Bill, which is to stop people gambling on the outcome of the national lottery in bookies' offices, to go to Second Stage to absorb another couple of hours.

It calls on the Government to leave that toxic treaty.  I commend the five young people, aged 17 to 31, who are now taking a case regarding the Energy Charter Treaty to the European Court of Human Rights because the treaty protects fossil fuel investors.  This toxic treaty has cost member states &euro;110 billion in compensation for changes in national energy laws that would seek to reduce their profits.  The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report specifically called out the Energy Charter Treaty as being a block to climate action.  We feel obliged to put a motion on the Order Paper to call for the Government to withdraw from the treaty.  It is an obstacle to action on the climate crisis.  It means that fossil fuel companies have greater rights under the treaty than communities.  The legal action being taken by young people is backed by 76 climate scientists who argue that continuation of the Energy Charter Treaty will either prevent the closure of fossil fuel companies or will mean there is an enormous financial burden on citizens because they will be expected to foot the bill for fossil fuel companies' stranded assets under this treaty.<\/p> <p>It is concerning that this does not just relate to fossil fuel companies.  Spain has faced litigation under the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism relating to renewable energy companies.

We are in the process of auctioning our resources for offshore wind to some of the companies that are currently taking ISDS cases against our European counterparts under the Energy Charter Treaty, including in the Netherlands.

No. 19 relates to the introduction of the Broadcasting (Gender, Cultural and Other Diversities) Bill 2022.  I extend my support to Senator McDowell on his earlier comments.  I am introducing this Bill because I believe we need to see greater representation on our airwaves of women, those of colour and all types of sexual orientation and socioeconomic status.  We want our airwaves to be representative of this country, the people who make it up, and the wonderful diversity among our people.  I know that many broadcasters have made enormous strides on gender representation in their panel discussions, in appointing women as presenters and in playing music composed, performed and conducted by women.

This Bill is vital in the conversation on the action we need to take to ensure greater diversity, equality and inclusion regarding both the spoken word and music content on our airwaves.<\/p><p>I am delighted we have in the Visitors Gallery today Linda Coogan Byrne of the Why Not Her? collective.  It is owing to her work as a media and music professional and campaigner over a number of years that we are having this discussion today about equality on our airwaves.  Over the past three years, the Why Not Her? collective has published reports holding up a mirror to broadcasters in Ireland.  Ms Coogan Byrne's work has shown, through the analysis of media data, the disproportionate and very low number of women's voices on our airwaves.  Therefore, we have to ask, \"Why not her?\"  Between June 2021 and June 2022, just 18% of Irish artists were featured in Ireland's top 100 most played artists and bands on Irish radio.  Of the songs of the 18%, only three were by female artists.  People of colour based in Ireland did not even feature in the top 100 played artists, yet we know we have some brilliant emerging talent here in Ireland, including Soul&eacute;, Tol&uuml; Makay, Cherry Dragon, Gemma Bradley and Denise Chaila.  Of course, we also have the likes of Imelda May, who is much more established, but we know when we look at the figures that these individuals get far less airplay than they deserve and is needed.  Some 3.19 million people tune in to radio every day in this country.  We know that, for performers, getting onto playlists can have a life-changing impact on their ability to make a livelihood out of their music.  Therefore, it is vital we have this conversation.  I acknowledge that a number of radio stations have stepped up to the mark over recent years.  The likes of Spin FM, KCLR, MidWest Radio, Northern Sound, 98FM, Clare FM and a number of RT&Eacute; stations have moved to ensure that at least 25% of their airplay is devoted to women artists.<\/p><p>Before introducing this Bill today, we invited artists from throughout this country, but a number of female artists were told not to turn up or support this campaign for better representation for women on the airwaves.  This is what we are up against.  I am referring to the intimidation and hostility towards making changes.  I look forward to when we can debate this Bill more fully, but I welcome its being on the Order Paper as of today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#R00400","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Will the Senator clarify that her proposal is that No. 19 be taken before No. 2?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#S00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Yes, indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#S00300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I second the proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#S00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Flynn, I welcome her niece, Katie Hanifin, to the Gallery.

Like some of my colleagues, I attended the briefing held across the road by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  We are dealing with a population that is increasingly elderly.  People are living longer and, as such, more have dementia.  The ask of the society is actually quite reasonable.  It is asking for less than &euro;20 million.  This would make a huge difference in terms of home visits, providing support within the community, doing research and funding centres of excellence.  The society does very good work.  I speak to families regularly who engage with it and their feedback is extraordinary.

The remote service itself, GenderGP, was founded by a man who has been struck off the UK medical register for failure to provide adequate care for trans patients as young as nine.  His wife, the co-founder, was suspended for two months last week for the failure to provide proper care to patients aged 12 and 17 and to discuss fertility issues with an 11-year-old girl.  Under this system, young people experiencing gender dysphoria who are being railroaded into medical intervention will not experience such feelings without a proper, necessary, medical, psychiatric assessment and care that should be an absolute prerequisite.

The 64,000 men and women of our country who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease today must be supported.  Not only that, but their families and those who care for them must also be supported, especially within their own homes so they can stay at home for as long as possible.  The Alzheimer Society of Ireland told us that by 2045 it is expected that 150,000 of us will have Alzheimer's disease or dementia.  That is a startling figure.  Its pre-budget request is a very interesting one in that it is not about money.  It is about the supports, the investment and the scaffolding of care we can give people.  I would ask people who did not go to the pre-budget hearing today to engage with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  There is nothing for members of the LGBT community around dementia care.

I have personal reason to be very grateful for the good work that organisation does.  One of the points that came across clearly today was that the work of caring, be that within families or paid care, must be valued.  People must be paid a proper wage.  There is a problem in some areas, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach has pointed out, in getting people to do this important work even when the resources have been put in place to deal with it.  That must be prioritised in the budget.<\/p> <p>I also agree with what Senator McGahon said about the dangers of populism.  As I said yesterday during a debate on legislation, the work of the Oireachtas and the Parliament is key in rowing against any groupthink or cancellation of people for their ideas.  Only today some people addressed me as I was coming into Leinster House who are concerned about the fact that the word \"woman\" or the idea of being a woman is proposed to be erased from certain legislation.  Those issues are controversial but there are people who want to make important points.  There are people with major concerns about the human rights of children, mothers and women in the context of surrogacy.  It must be possible to make trenchant interventions and state clearly what one believes to be wrong or harmful to society without being accused of being unchristian or being bullied or accused of being a bigot.<\/p> <p>We can set an example as parliamentarians by making our points strongly without ever attacking the person.  Where I have sinned against that, I apologise.  Everybody should see that is the clear line.

As far as I am concerned, Senator Keogan is the one who has suffered most in this regard in the way she was treated by this Member.

The HSE seems hell-bent on closing Navan hospital accident and emergency department, despite it covering over 200,000 people and a population that is still growing.  It is obvious that the hospital in Drogheda is already under immense pressure without adding the Navan accident and emergency department numbers.<\/p> <p>While I appreciate the need for streamlining, I fail to see the benefit of moving services around if the result is chaotic overcrowding.

Any financial support it gets is most welcome and makes a major difference for many families.<\/p> <p>I will speak on another issue that has been brought to my attention.  I do so on behalf of a family I know personally.  Every year in Ireland, an average of six children are born with spinal muscular atrophy.  Children born with this condition may never walk and if left untreated, 95% of children with the severest form will not live past 24 months.  The HSE has accepted that spinal muscular atrophy should be treated and every year considerable resources are being put into treating people who have it.  Unfortunately, many of the symptoms of the condition do not manifest until children are 12 months old.<\/p> <p>The simple and low-cost solution to this is the heel-prick test, which we all remember.  I can still remember bringing each of my three children in for the test.  If spinal muscular atrophy could be added to this blood test, we would know straight away whether a child has this condition.  It could be treated straight away and we would not have children who are unable able to walk or do not live beyond 24 months.  The total cost of the proposal, based on an average figure of 60,000 children born in the country per year, would be &euro;300,000.<\/p> <p>The heel-prick test was not available for the family that I know but if it was in place for all families going forward, it would mean the treatment, which is recognised and funded by the HSE, could be administered earlier and children would not pass away or be in a position that they cannot walk.  I ask that this proposal be put to the Minister for Health for consideration as part of the budget.  Funding of &euro;300,000 per year is a very small price to ask. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#U00400","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will not be in a position to support the Order of Business.

It will be a major issue in Donegal, Clare and a number of other counties.  There will be a time when we look back and ask whether we examined this legislation in detail.

I pass on my respects to his family and the family of Councillor James Tobin.<\/p> <p>I too attended the briefing today by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  I support its call with regard to extended funding.  As a member of the all-party Oireachtas group on dementia, I am aware of the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to this area.  Three of the most important areas in which I wish to see investment in budget 2021 are the provision of &euro;2 million for specific day-care services, &euro;2.3 million for therapeutic support and education for family carers and &euro;10 million for dementia home care.<\/p> <p>Recently, Dublin Coach announced its withdrawal of a bus service between the city centre to the Castletroy-Annacotty area of Limerick.  More than 1,000 houses and a new hospital are being built in the area.  Many businesses, such as Northern Trust, depend on the bus service to transport their employees.

However, we cannot have separate facts.  People must accept what is fact and what is not.  We only have to look at Russia where the majority of people support the war in Ukraine because they are receiving disinformation rather than factual truth.  That is, however, a much longer debate that we could have on another day.<\/p> <p>The N24 road project from Limerick to Waterford is strategically important.  There are two phases, one of which is a route from Cahir to Waterford.  This phase has reached public consultation stage and five routes have been chosen.  The consultation stage for any roads project is very important.  Everyone is in favour of the project and it is welcome.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir and its environs are concerned about the five routes, in particular one proposed route through a scenic 5 km walkway.  While it is a road, the route is used for recreational purposes by cyclists, members of local GAA and soccer clubs as well as people who like to go for walks as they know it is exactly 5 km.  If one of the routes is chosen, it will dissect the walkway route used by people in the town.  People are very concerned about that route being picked and have come together to do something.  I met Mr. Bobby Fitzgerald, the chairperson of a committee of local residents.  Members of GAA clubs, soccer clubs and the Carrick Wheelers cycling club are also concerned.  Senators will know that Carrick-on-Suir has produced two of the best cyclists in Ireland.  There are very young people coming through who could be better than Sam Bennett and Se&aacute;n Kelly.  Everyone supports the idea of keeping the 5 km walkway as it is used by everyone in the town.  I emphasise that people in Carrick-on-Suir want a new road.  However, we should not take away an amenity that is hugely beneficial and used by everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#V00200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Senator Currie has waited patiently all morning.

Nowhere else is the impact of the policy of brinkmanship pursued by the British Government and Conservative Party more clear than in Northern Ireland where the principles that brought communities and opposing philosophies together 25 years ago have been completely undermined and disregarded.  People should never have entertained the idea that Boris Johnson would be given the privilege of staying on as caretaker Prime Minister until October.  His premiership is ending in shame.  He has no respect for the rule of law and standards in public office.  Meanwhile. Northern Ireland has no Assembly and no Secretary of State.  Northern Ireland cannot wait, and I hope the next Prime Minister has more respect for the needs and democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>Today, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued its report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the right to request to remote work legislation.  The report makes recommendations, some of which I support.  For example, I support the call for support to be provided to SMEs.  We helped businesses transition through Brexit with the Brexit-ready campaign and we helped SMEs with digital transformation.  Why not have a remote-ready campaign?  We should support businesses through something that is only going to benefit rural communities.  The service timeline in the proposed Bill should be removed.   People should not have to wait 26 weeks to access the right to request remote working.  That right should be available immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#V00400","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome my daughter Jaelynne to the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#V00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I welcome Jaelynne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#V00600","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Like her mother and my mother, Jaelynne will, thankfully, be a woman on the right side of history.<\/p> <p>It is disingenuous to talk about hate campaigns.

We cannot only use free speech to suit ourselves.  When free speech is turned back on those politicians in terms of how other people feel about their actions, ideologies and behaviours, they claim bullying and victimisation.  If you want to be a supporter and advocate of free speech, you must expect the same to be applied to yourself.  Free speech does not only mean that when I say something in this Chamber I am a bully but when you say it, it is an opinion.  I am sorry but the double standards are unbelievable.

This morning, the current Prime Minister, and soon to be former Prime Minister, used the term \"Them's the breaks\".  Those three little words show his disdain and disrespect not just for his office but for the party he said he was so proud to lead in the last number of years.  I believe and hope that when there is a new Prime Minister it will be the time, as Senator McGahon has asked, to have a debate on restoring the relationships we have not just with Northern Ireland but also with Westminster and our colleagues across the water.

I hope that we would not do something as Irish as to pick a route that would actually deprive people of an amenity, and particularly in rural Ireland where we do not have parks the way one might have in urban settings.  I certainly concur with the sentiments expressed by the Senator Ahearn.<br\/><br\/>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about dementia support, as others did.  Representatives of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland are across the road in Buswells Hotel following their briefing.  If anyone has not yet managed to get over there, they might do so later on.  The Senator also highlighted a debate request on public transport, as has been made previously, arising from the cancellation of the coach from Dublin to Castletroy, which is a tremendous pity.<br\/><br\/>Senator Victor Boyhan mentioned the Order of Business, as did other Members, and I will come back to this.<br\/><br\/>Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy<b><\/b>spoke about the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  The Senator also asked that the spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, test be included in the budget considerations this year.  Another colleague had also raised this issue in the last week.  It is a &euro;5 test.  It is nothing in comparison to the impact of catching that horrible disease early.  The impact, especially for the families of the children involved, would be enormous.  I concur with Senator and support his call.<br\/><br\/>Senator Dolan spoke about the future funding of higher education report.  I look forward to having a debate on this, which I will organise as soon as I can once we come back after the summer recess.<br\/><br\/>Senator Hoey spoke about Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and the proposed changes by the HSE.  I believe we have been listening to this for 12 or 13 years.  I wish the people well at the rally on Saturday but a resolution needs to be found.  We cannot keep having the same conversation.  Ultimately, the clinicians are telling us that the service is not safe.  Nobody wants a service that is not safe.  We either fix the service and make it safe, or give the transitions to the other hospitals and ensure the transitions are given to the other hospitals.  As the Senator said, we have examples that we certainly should be learning from, and they are not good examples.  I thank her for raising the issue this morning.<br\/><br\/>Senator Mullen spoke about dementia care and the fact that we must value care.  The Senator also spoke about the dangers of populism.  I wrote down some of his words this.  We need to set an example that we never play the person and we only ever talk about policy.  To be fair, however, one can see, both in this House and the other Chamber, that there are lots of examples where we do not play the policy and we are concentrating on playing the person, which is a real shame.  We all have a responsibility to make sure that we heed the Senator's words.<br\/><br\/>Senator Buttimer spoke about challenging respectfully.  It is interesting that we are all on the same page about having respect, and not just for the people we represent or the debate we are having, but also for each other.  Senator Boyhan also spoke about the dignity in work policy this morning, yet it does not seem to translate when we have the debates.  We need to recheck ourselves and recheck our mindset as to what we think treating somebody with dignity actually means.<br\/><br\/>Senator Buttimer also spoke about Pride in the month of June.  We have Limerick Pride on Saturday.  The Cork trans campaign is ongoing and looking for support.  The Senator is looking for a wider debate, particularly around LGBT supports for people with Alzheimer's.<br\/><br\/>Senator McGahon spoke about British-Irish relationships and how much they have deteriorated.<br\/><br\/>Senator Keogan spoke about re-examining the schedule next week, which I will come back to.  The Senator also mentioned the advocacy group Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI.  I wrote a note here on the standard practice of not impugning people.  She made a reference to a particular gentleman who is not in the Chamber.  I remind all of us not to be &quot;stealing your clothes and taking your job&quot;.  The standard practice of this Chamber, and all Chambers, is not to impugn anybody who is not here to defend themselves.  I remind all of us about this standard practice this afternoon.<br\/><br\/>Senator Martin Conway spoke about the Alzheimer Society of Ireland's call for &euro;20 million for dementia services in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Senator Eileen Flynn spoke about Traveller Pride and the reports that we are going to discuss in this House - and I hope that all Senators will discuss it here next week - on mental health, health, education, accommodation and violence in the Traveller community.  It is something we should all be mindful of, and particularly around some of the challenges that the Traveller community have that the rest of us do not and maybe do not appreciate.  Senators could probably listen and learn a lot next week.  I am looking forward to that.<br\/><br\/>Senator Sherlock asked for an amendment to the Order of Business this morning, which I am happy to take.  She also spoke about the Why Not Her? campaign and welcomed Linda Coogan Byrne to the Chamber earlier this morning to support that campaign.<br\/><br\/>Senator Lynn Boylan spoke about Sinn F&eacute;in's motion on the Energy Charter Treaty.  I assume that we will debate this during the party's next time schedule.  I thank the Senator for that.<br\/><br\/>Senator Michael McDowell raised the Order of Business and I will come back to that.<br\/><br\/>Senator Seery Kearney welcomed the international surrogacy report yesterday.  Finally we are on the roadmap to having equality for all of our children in the State, which is great.  I am very mindful, and I did not realise until the Senator said it, that the report is so highly regarded that it may form part of a future international convention.  On behalf of, hopefully, all of the Senator's colleagues I would like to put on record a very big thank you for the amount of work Senator Seery Kearney has done, along with other colleagues, in recent weeks to make sure of this body of work, which is so highly respected and regarded.  We just need to get it into legislation as quickly as we can.  I welcome that and wanted to put it on the record.<br\/><br\/>Senator Fiona O'Loughlin spoke today about the need for change around the recent awful announcement of what happened in the hospital in Cork with organ incineration.  I cannot even begin to imagine what the families must be feeling.  We must be mindful of the standards to which we hold ourselves in delivering public services, and by Jove, the HSE certainly failed in those standards to the families of those 18 babies.<br\/><br\/>Senator O'Loughlin also looked for a debate on inclusive transport, particularly with regard to a long overdue replacement for the motorised transport scheme, which was stood down in 2013.<br\/><br\/>I wish to pay our condolences, not only to our Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues but also to the families of Councillor Jerry O'Dea and Councillor James Tobin.  We acknowledge their passing recently.<br\/><br\/>I will now address the Order of Business, and specifically some of the comments that Senator McDowell made.  We have a leaders' meeting every Thursday at which the Order of Business is presented to the group leaders.  We get it and we agree or we do not agree at that weekly meeting what the Order of Business will be for the following week.  This happens every Thursday, just in case the Senator is not aware.<br\/><br\/>I was in this Chamber last Thursday explaining to Members that I would probably be coming to them this week, somewhat reluctantly but there was no doubt I would have to do it, to give them the heads-up that I would probably be using the guillotine, and asking them to do all Stages of certain Bills this week.  I said that I would give them plenty of notice and, indeed, I did that.  On the third point, there was one request at the Order of Business on Tuesday from Members of the Opposition for us to revisit the schedule this week.  We sat down on Tuesday afternoon, we revisited the schedule, and we changed that on the request of Members of the Opposition.  This is why we got a new Order of Business yesterday.  I am aware that the new Order of Business was not acceptable subsequent to that, but on the request change it, we did change it.  The Senator's assertion that no attempt was made to discuss the business taking place is wrong on three counts.  I ask him to withdraw that, just to be fair.<br\/><br\/>I totally accept that there are concerns around the schedule next week, and the Senator is entitled to raise his concerns on the Order of Business.  He also incorrectly stated that he would have no opportunity next week.  There will be an Order of Business on Tuesday and the Senator can object then.  There will be an Order of Business on Wednesday and he can object then.  The reason there is no Order of Business on Tuesday is it is an extra day and we do have a lot of work to get through.  Please do not be the person who says, &quot;Oh me, I never got notice before and I am really not happy&quot;.  There have been, at numerous stages, discussions and information flow from myself and from the Seanad Office.  I understand and appreciate that the Senator does not like the order next week but we have a body of work to do and I only have a certain amount of time in which to do it.  That is the order as it is.  It stands, as amended, only to include Senator Marie Sherlock's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#V01200","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader.

I do not propose to accept this amendment for a number of reasons.<\/p> <p>First, the Bill is subject to commencement provisions as set out in section 1(5).  These are not time-bound.  The placement of such a time-bound provision in the Bill would not be advisable from a technical perspective.  Under section 6, there will be a single establishment day for the commission.  There is no provision for establishing the commission to carry out certain functions and not others.  I do not believe this would be a sensible approach.  Notwithstanding that, it is my firm intention that the commission shall be established as soon as possible.  To this end, a transition team has been put in place within the Department to progress the administrative elements of its establishment.  Support is being received from a range of public bodies in this regard and the commission will be established as a matter of priority.<\/p> <p>The Bill provides for the review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies to be undertaken by the new electoral commission following its establishment.  It also provides for the repeal of Part II of the Electoral Act 1997, including section 5, which currently provides for the establishment of a Constituency Commission following the publication of a census of population report setting out the preliminary results of a census.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the report of the electoral commission on the review of D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies will be published within three months of the publication of final census results.  This mirrors current arrangements whereby a Constituency Commission must complete its work within three months of the publication of final census results.  While the publication of final census results is a matter for the Central Statistics Office, final results of this year's census are anticipated for publication in spring 2023.  This would indicate that a final report from the electoral commission on D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies can be expected this time next year.  It will be a matter for the Oireachtas to legislate for revised constituency boundaries following its consideration of the final report of the commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#AA00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, and 9 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#AA00500","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 18, line 31, to delete &quot;, in so far as practicable,&quot;. <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks to delete the term &quot;in so far as practicable&quot; in respect of efforts to be made by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to ensure an equitable balance between women and men on the electoral commission.  We tabled an amendment aiming to achieve a similar end on Committee Stage, which sought a minimum level of representation of women on the commission.<\/p><p>I acknowledge that the Bill, as drafted, contains a provision that seeks to ensure equitable representation between genders on the commission, but the provision contains the qualifier &quot;in so far as practicable&quot;.  The relevant subsection states &quot;the Service shall, in so far as practicable, endeavour to ensure that among the ordinary members of the Commission there is an equitable balance between men and women&quot;.  In my view, it is unnecessary to include the term &quot;in so far as practicable&quot;.  The word &quot;endeavour&quot; means to try or attempt to achieve something.  We should endeavour without qualification to ensure a more equitable gender balance.  We should always try to do so, not just when it is practicable to try.  The amendment seeks to delete the qualifier within the relevant subsection as it relates to an equitable gender balance on the commission.  If accepted, it will ultimately make the provision in the subsection stronger.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 would insert a new subsection in section 9 requiring that when recommending to the Government persons for appointment as ordinary members of the commission, the PAS &quot;shall have due regard to obligations under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&quot;.  We have complementary amendments that refer to the PAS having due regard to the Equal Status Acts when making appointments.  The core of what we are trying to achieve is that when the PAS is making appointments, it needs to think about equality and its public sector duty and obligations in this regard.  The electoral commission must be diverse and must properly reflect Irish society.  If we do not make this provision, we will continue to have an inequitable political system.  I urge the Minister of State to accept this relatively straightforward amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to ensure greater diversity in the make-up of the proposed commission.  We tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage, which was defeated in a vote.  This amendment aims to achieve the same outcome through a different means.  The Bill currently provides that the PAS &quot;shall have regard to the desirability of the members of the Commission possessing knowledge of, and experience in&quot; electoral matters, electoral systems, public administration and governance, financial matters and advertising.  It makes no reference to the desirability of members having experience in, or knowledge of, human rights and equality matters.  As I stressed on Committee Stage, it is very important the electoral commission should be both reflective of, and have an understanding of, the diversity of Irish life and society.<\/p><p>First and foremost, we should endeavour to improve the representation of minorities and minority groups in the commission membership.  We also must ensure, at a minimum, that the commission members have knowledge and understanding of the issues of inclusion and diversity.  We need to engage more people from different walks of life in the electoral process and in politics more generally.  If we are serious about challenging the imbalance that currently exists, having knowledge and understanding of diversity and inclusion at the level of the electoral commission must be a baseline.  As I have noted previously, the commission will have a wide range of functions, including explaining referendums and electoral processes to the public and encouraging public participation in the electoral and democratic processes of the State.  Persons with knowledge and understanding of disenfranchisement are best placed to provide advice in trying to address it.  This amendment would seek to achieve that.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 provides that where the Minister is agreeing with the PAS the requirements relating to knowledge, ability and suitability for appointment as chief executive of the commission for the purposes of a selection competition under this section, he or she would have due regard &quot;both to the desirability of the appointee possessing knowledge of, and experience in, electoral matters, and obligations as set out under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#AA00600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#AA00700","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Higgins, Ruane, Flynn and Black for these amendments, which relate to the membership of an coimisi&uacute;n.  I welcome the sentiments behind them, which relate to participation in, and wider engagement with, our electoral process, as Senator Ruane outlined.  That is what this Bill, in its overarching thrust, sets out to achieve.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 2 relates to the gender balance among ordinary members of the commission.  Section 18(5) states that when recommending to the Government persons for appointment as ordinary members of an coimisi&uacute;n, the PAS \"shall, in so far as practicable, endeavour to ensure that among the ordinary members of the Commission there is an equitable balance between men and women\".  The amendment proposes to remove the term \"in so far as practicable\" from this subsection.  Having regard to the fact an coimisi&uacute;n requires a wide range of skills and experience to carry out a broad array of specialised functions, I do not intend to make this provision more restrictive, as to do so could militate against its ability to get the requisite skills and experience on board.  I note that section 18(5) accords with the provisions set out in section 16 of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines on appointments to State boards, which specifies a target of at least 40% representation of each gender on State boards.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 require that the PAS, in the selection of candidates for ordinary membership of the commission, has due regard to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the desirability of the membership being broadly reflective of the diversity of Irish society and the need to ensure representation among the ordinary membership of persons to whom the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2018 apply.  The PAS is a key participant in the Government's comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is an all-of-government approach to supporting persons with disabilities in addressing barriers and challenges that can impact on such persons entering employment and participating in selection processes.  The Commission for Public Service Appointments', CPSA, Code of Practice: Appointment of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Civil Service and Certain Public Bodies sets out the principles and standards to be applied in the recruitment of persons with disabilities, which are applied by PAS and are subject to audit by the CPSA.  I am of the view that the obligations of PAS under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, as it stands, are well covered in legislation and are integrated into its plans and processes.  As such, I do not intend to accept this amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 9 requires that PAS, in selecting the candidate for recommendation as chief executive of the commission, has regard to the desirability of the candidate possessing knowledge of, and experience in, electoral matters and the obligations set out under section Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  These obligations include the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services and protect the human rights of persons in the course of running the requisite selection competitions.  In other legislative precedents, the recruitment processes and skill sets of the chief executives or equivalents of other public bodies are not set out in legislation.<\/p><p>Section 20 sets out the process for selection, appointment and reappointment of the chief executive.  My intention in setting out this process was to ensure that while the Government makes the appointment, it has no say in who the independent selection process puts forward for appointment.

Currently, the Bill provides that the chief executive can have a five-year term and may be reappointed, but not for more than ten years sequentially at a time.  This amendment would seek to only allow two terms to the chief executive and no more than that.<\/p> <p>I spoke earlier about accountability and transparency.  In other positions of great public importance, such as Chief Justice, there is a fixed term and a recognition that an individual should not hold onto such a large amount of power, for example, in a number of election cycles, for a long or indefinite period.  I have suggested here that it might be only renewable once.  It could be renewable twice but I am concerned that, as the Bill provides, it could be for a large number of renewable periods, including a period of ten years, and we could be looking at decades.<\/p> <p>We have seen in other countries, for example, the difference five years or ten years can make in electoral processes.  I do not like to name other places or jurisdictions but look at, for example, some of the potential diminution in voting rights in the United States in a short period.  It is important that a position is not held for a prolonged period.  A ten-year appointment is too long; two to three renewals should be sufficient.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 8 deletes the provisions around the length of time.

Amendment No. 14 specifically provides that the electoral commission has responsibility for undertaking a thorough review of the Electoral Act on its establishment.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 11 separately provides that progress of the review of the Electoral Acts would be reported in the commission's annual report until such a time that the review is complete.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 11 and 14 are closely related and should be considered together.  As I noted on Committee Stage proceedings, the Bill provides us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to amend our electoral laws.<\/p> <p>It also provides a rare and important opportunity to address and to clarify the existing definition of &ldquo;political purposes&rdquo;, which is contained in the Electoral Act 1997.  The definition has created an anomaly between the regulation of the campaigns of politicians and normal, everyday advocacy and community-led campaigns that take place throughout the country.  The Minister of State advised during the course of the D&aacute;il debates on this Bill, as well as in the Committee Stage debate last week, that he would not accept amendments seeking to address this anomaly, given that the wholesale review of the Electoral Acts is proposed to be undertaken by the yet-to-be-established electoral commission, including the Act&rsquo;s provisions regarding political funding and donations.  <\/p> <p>As I stressed in last week's debate, delaying this matter further by referring to the prospective electoral commission means further uncertainty for community groups, campaigns and civil society organisations.  It could also mean that efforts to grow the philanthropic sector in Ireland would be hindered by the uncertainty regarding their legal position.  If the Minister of State is not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 49 or 50, and he refers the issues relating to the definition of political purposes to the electoral commission, I ask him to consider specifying in the legislation that the commission shall be charged with undertaking this review, as well as to build in regular progress reviews to the annual reporting mechanisms of the commission until such a time that a review is complete.  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 14, as I have noted, relates closely to amendment No. 11.  I will not rehash the purpose of these amendments in any great detail, other than to stress how urgently the wider review of the Electoral Act is needed.  This amendment aims to enshrine in the legislation that the proposed electoral commission will be charged with responsibility for the wholesale review of the Electoral Acts upon its establishment.  While I acknowledge that the Minister of State is committed to this review being undertaken, I am concerned about this review being completed in the lifetime of this Government.  Civil society has waited long enough for this change to be made.  I am concerned that with the promise of the wider review, the critical issue will be put on the back burner again.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#CC01600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Ruane, Higgins, Black and Flynn for tabling these amendments, which relate to requiring that an coimisi&uacute;n undertake a review of the Electoral Act 1997.

As part of its work, an coimisi&uacute;n will prepare research programmes, conduct research on electoral policy and procedure and provide advice as required to the Minister and the Government on electoral issues.

This would be with the view to an coimisi&uacute;n making recommendations on how to address, among other matters, the concerns raised by civil society organisations concerning the definition of \"political purposes\" and its impact on fundraising activities of certain civil society organisations.  It is my belief that the proposed review could be completed within a relatively short timeframe, following the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in.

A number of these amendments return to the same measures.  As the Minister is aware, these are measures echoed across lots of legislation.  The reason they need to be echoed across lots of legislation is that Ireland has in recent years ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We have also become very aware of the lack of digital literacy in Ireland.  There has been very strong research in respect of access and literacy issues.  We also have a mandate in respect of plain English and accessible language.  There are a number of imperatives that it is important we start to reflect in our legislation and in how we communicate information.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 12 requires an annual report to be published in an accessible manner on a website maintained by the commission.  Amendment No. 15 places a requirement on the commission to publish information pertinent to referendums in an accessible format.  I know it was highlighted during the debate yesterday that it often does so but as I will come to in one of my later amendments, the fact that the commission does so is not the same as a guarantee that it will do so.  These should not be discretionary matters but should be clearly provided for.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 16 seeks to require that information relating to referendums will also be published in print media so that those persons who may lack digital literacy are able to fully engage with referendum notices and materials.  Ireland has one of the highest rates of digital illiteracy in the EU, according to the EU digital society and economic skills index.  More than 40% of the population lack basic digital skills.  I emphasise this fact repeatedly.  The fact that many tech giant companies are located in Ireland may give a false illusion that Ireland has a high level of digital literacy but we have a low level thereof.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 17 deletes the phrase \"as far as is practicable\" from the provisions that require the commission to publish in the English and Irish languages and distribute such statements related to the referendum in such a matter and by such a means, including the use of television, radio or other electronic means, as the commission considers most likely to bring them to the attention of the electorate.  The phrase \"as far as is practicable\" should be removed in relation to the means employed enabling those with sight or hearing disability to read or hear the statements concerned.  We had a lengthy debate on this issue on Committee Stage.  It is not sufficient for us to simply hope the commission complies.  This is a new body that has been established but the previous referendum commission had a practice of making things available for those who may have a sight or hearing disability.  The fact is that Irish Sign Language is a recognised language in the State.  We have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It is a basic provision that there would be access to that information.  We should not have legislation which suggests a limitation around that access by the inclusion of the words \"as far as is practicable\".  It is a right and, therefore, should not be subject to a caveat or given a diminution by including that phrase.  It is not a nice thing to add on but is a requirement and the legislation should reflect that, not simply the practice of the commission.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 33 compels the commission to publish its review in an accessible format both online and in a physical format.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#EE00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I thank Senators Ruane, Higgins, Black and Flynn for these amendments, which seek to amend the existing provisions relating to the publication of information by the electoral commission.

Amendment No. 15 specifies that as part of an coimisi&uacute;n's referendum functions, the statements which it prepares and publishes to explain the subject matter of referendums will be published in plain language.  Amendment No. 16 requires that print media be explicitly mentioned in the forms of media to which an coimisi&uacute;n has regard in the distribution of referendum statements.

I do not propose to accept these amendments for the following reasons.  The wording of amendment No. 12 which relates to the publication of an coimisi&uacute;n's annual report is based on an established precedent set in section 28 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  Being mindful of an coimisi&uacute;n's independence, I intend to leave the decision-making on this matter of the most appropriate means for the publication of an coimisi&uacute;n's documents, including the annual report, to an coimisi&uacute;n itself.  In regard to both amendments Nos. 12 and 33, as they relate to the accessibility of the format of documents, the European Union (Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) Regulations 2020 came into force on 23 September 2020 and will apply to the website of, and content produced by, an coimisi&uacute;n.  It should also be noted that under section 26 of the Bill, an coimisi&uacute;n's annual report is required to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A complete record of all documents laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas are also available on the Oireachtas website.  I am satisfied the accessibility of such documents is already appropriately provided for.  In respect of amendment No. 15, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, the matter of the presentation of an coimisi&uacute;n's public information material explaining referendums is an issue of best practice and an administrative matter for an coimisi&uacute;n, rather than a matter to be addressed in primary legislation.  The Referendum Commission of Ireland, from whom this function is transferring, has set a strong precedent for ensuring the accessibility and ease of comprehension of material explaining the subject matter of referendums.  For example, in respect of previous referendums, versions of the referendum guide were produced in braille, Irish Sign Language, video, audio, large-print format and easy-to-read format for people with intellectual disabilities.  As already said, the accessibility of formats of documents produced by the commission will be covered by the European Union (Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies) Regulations 2020, which will apply to the website of, and content produced by, an coimisi&uacute;n.  I am, therefore, confident that material explaining referendums is currently being prepared in an accessible and easily-understood manner.  As such these practices will be carried over and developed by An Coimisi&uacute;n Toghch&aacute;in when it takes on this role.<br\/><br\/>In regard to amendments Nos. 16 and 17, section 30(1)(b) of the Bill relating to the publication and distribution of an coimisi&uacute;n's statements, which explain the subject matter of referendums, is a direct transposition of the Referendum Act 1998.  It is not proposed to accept this proposed amendment as the general approach has been taken of avoiding the amendment of transposed legislation, except where necessary to take account of a transferring function&rsquo;s new organisational context.  The section as it stands provides that an coimisi&uacute;n may &quot;publish ... and distribute such statements in relation to the referendum concerned in such manner and by such means including the use of television, radio and other electronic media&quot; and<i><\/i>as such it is not limiting an coimisi&uacute;n to particular formats.  It provides flexibility for an coimisi&uacute;n to publish statements by any form of media which it considers appropriate, which would include print media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#EE00800","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The question is not just best practice and whether the commission will engage in best practice, as it may choose to draw on the precedent of the Referendum Commission of Ireland, or not.  The question is best practice in legislation.  To put a caveat and a dilution in respect of the question of accessibility is not best practice in legislation.  The Minister of State referred to where there is a different organisational context, and the fact is that there is a different context.  I made clear two of the contexts, one being the recognition of Irish Sign Language as a language in the State, the other being the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability.  Those are two very clear changes in the context from previous legislation and they should have been reflected in the wording of this legislation.  I do not believe it is sufficient to say we are following what we did before.  The context and the responsibilities have changed.  The rights of persons have changed and I do not think we should have legislation which creates an ambiguity around \"as far as practicable\", especially bearing in mind that there are other places in legislation where we talk about value for money.

Yesterday we enumerated the long process and the fact that in 1979 the public voted in favour of the expansion of the university franchise by an overwhelming majority.  Again in 2015 in a campaign with the message &ldquo;Open it don't close it&rdquo; in relation to the Seanad, the public, including all those who do not currently have a vote in the Seanad - the vast majority of citizens do not have any say in who sits in this Second Chamber &ndash; very strongly chose to retain the second Chamber and chose to support a campaign clearly run on the message of reform rather than removal.  I do not have to revisit what an extraordinarily cynical campaign it was, namely, the campaign to abolish the Seanad.<\/p> <p>The Seanad has made an extraordinary contribution in terms of legislation.  I need only look to the large number of Private Members&rsquo; Bills from the Seanad that have become law, the large number of amendments that are made in the Seanad, and the contribution that is made.  Certainly in the time I have been here I have seen the contribution of the Seanad over the last two Oireachtas.  The idea that saving a few quid would be the argument for why we should not have that part of the democratic process, the Oireachtas scrutiny of legislation, was very cynical.  It was rejected by the public.  The public appreciated the thematic perspective and the additional scrutiny the Seanad can provide.  The public also expressed, by voting for the retention of the Seanad, that it wants a say in and has opinions on the Seanad.  It sent a very strong message that it wants to be part of deciding what happens in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>That promise of reform was made in the last Oireachtas.  The very first day we brought forward proposals, we sat in the cross-party implementation group.  Senator Gavan&rsquo;s colleague, Senator Warfield, was there, as was Senator Cassells.  Senator McDowell acted as chair for that implementation group and we produced legislation that was ready to go and delivered to Government.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, chose to park it.  I need that to be made clear when people say Senators do not want to vote for or move this.  Senators worked hard for eight months on that.  The mandate of that implementation group was implementation of the Manning report which was itself developed with a cross-party group and independent chair.  It put forward clear proposals for the reform of the Seanad, namely, reforms that can happen without need for a constitutional referendum.<\/p> <p>We are a millions miles past time for action on this, and past the cynicism on it.  The fact that nowhere in this electoral reform Bill is there even an arrow or a breadcrumb trail towards any intention to act on this is exceptionally cynical and disappointing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This single issue is raised again and again.  It is around enhancing democracy.  The proposals we put forward would mean that every person in Ireland over the age of 18 would get an opportunity to vote in a Seanad election.  The public is not simply geographical in its thinking and concerns.  People are not simply thinking in terms of Galway, Carlow or Mayo.  Education is an area on which members of the public may be passionate about and may choose to act on.  Agriculture is another area.  Under the proposals we had, each person would be able to choose one of the thematic panels most relevant to him or her and be able to vote in that panel.  That would be empowering.  For example, those concerned with organic farming may be a minority in every single county but they may well constitute a sufficient constituency throughout the State to be able to elect a representative to speak about their concerns in this Chamber and to bring that perspective to legislation on agriculture.  I could give multiple examples.<\/p><p>This is a missed opportunity to have the public more engaged, interested and excited by the decisions being made and to feel more empowered.  This would enhance trust in democracy.  These are good proposals.  This legislation would have dealt with the issue whereby graduates have a privileged situation in terms of voting.  It would have meant that graduates would still only have one vote, the same as any other person in the State, although without a constitutional referendum, we cannot remove the fact graduates have a different vote.  They would simply have six places to choose between when deciding how to use their votes versus five.  We would be back to a principle of one person, one vote.<\/p><p>The legislation represented a compromise.  I would have liked it to be more for the public but in fact the legislation put forward still gave a voice to councillors and local representatives.  It simply did not give the monopoly that now exists where 43 Members of this House are elected by just over 1,000 people.  In a by-election that drops to just a few hundred.  There would still be that space for the representation of councillors, probably more than I would have liked, but that was the kind of compromise that everybody in that implementation group made to come up with legislation that could be agreed and voted on in majority by everybody in that committee.  We came up with proposals.  We all made compromises.  We moved other ideas that we had into appendices.  We agreed to bracket them in favour of doing our core central task, which was to implement the Manning report.  <\/p><p>The commission should be moving that forward.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 21 look for the Seanad reform implementation group and the Manning proposals to be furthered and reviewed if necessary.  It allows that they may be reviewed or changed and then implemented.  Amendment No. 21 relates to the issue of Seanad reform included in the provisions for an electoral commission and that it would conduct constituency reviews in reviewing constituencies for election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Amendment No. 24 relates to that core issue of reforming the Seanad.  We see the notices of Seanad 100.  It would have been something if in the centenary year of the Seanad we put down a marker for its future.  That is an opportunity that has been missed.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 24 seeks to provide that when preparing a report under subsection (1)(a)(iii) that the commission would have regard to any alterations in the electoral franchise for a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and any alterations to the criteria by which a Taoiseach may nominate a person as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  This is around preparing the legislation for a time in which we have a reformed Seanad so that the electoral commission is empowered in advance to fulfil the functions it needs to in terms of an open Seanad election.<\/p><p>I refer to a situation where criteria might be applied &ndash; again not to dictate but to inform the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision in regard to the appointment of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  There has been a slight backward step where it was the practice that there would be an attempt to ensure diversity from society but we only have one Member appointed in that manner in this Seanad as against five Members in the previous Seanad and, indeed, in the one before that who were appointed as representatives of under-represented groups in society.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 35 mirrors section 48 of the Seanad Bill 2020 in that it seeks to establish an electoral register.  In the case of this legislation, it would be mandated by the electoral commission.  One of the fundamental proposals and reforms put forward by the Manning report was the recommendation to expand the franchise at Seanad elections to include Irish citizens in the State, Irish passport holders abroad, and true to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, persons from Northern Ireland, and also to expand the range of graduates who would be able to vote, giving effect to the 1979 referendum result.  It is extraordinary that has not been acted upon.  This would enable members of the public to participate in Seanad elections in a way that had not been permitted before now.<\/p><p>This amendment allows that if a Seanad electoral register is set up there is a tangible first step in the reform process and on the widening of the register, in that we will already have the building blocks in place to set up a process of voluntary enrolment for persons who wish to vote in Seanad elections.  The committee heard significant testimony in that process of our implementation hearings.  Much of the scaremongering about numbers have not proven to be the case.  We have seen in the case of Mexico and elsewhere that voluntary enrolment reaches those who are engaged, feel committed and have a genuine connection to the political debates at hand.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 is one I hope the Minister of State will accept because it is the absolute minimum in terms of promises that have not been delivered.  This amendment leaves aside all of those concrete provisions that I am proposing and simply asks that there would be a report within 12 months of the passing of this Bill outlining, if not this, then what will be done.  If we are not dealing with it in the Electoral Reform Bill what is being done to reform the electoral franchise for the vocational panels of Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  What is being done to move forward on the electoral franchise for university constituencies?  What are the criteria that may inform the decisions that might be made by a Taoiseach when nominating Members to Seanad &Eacute;ireann under Article 18?<\/p><p>Some of the proposals we have made are only advisory but that there would be considerations to gender balance, diversity and the representation of minority groups.  I have already spoken about the vocational panels.  I fully support the implementation of the seventh amendment of the Constitution to give all graduates a vote.  The group proposed to lower that to diploma level.  However, it cannot be done in isolation.  We need to look to the wholesale reform and that suite of measures.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 44 seeks to ensure the provision that a registration authority may enter the name of a person on the pending electoral list for the register of electors of a constituency in Seanad &Eacute;ireann if the franchise was to be extended.  This is incorporating a reform we hope for and laying the groundwork, giving appropriate mandates to the electoral commission in that regard.  This seeks to mirror the provisions in respect of pre-registration for younger people in regard to D&aacute;il elections, which is a positive move although I would like to see the vote at 16 being delivered.  Pre-registration is a positive measure and the same measures should be afforded in regard to the Seanad.  I say that as somebody for whom few people of that age would vote because due to the nature of my constituency, they need to be graduates.  That is an unfortunate situation. <\/p><p>That is the last amendment in this suite of measures.  The Minister of State has been here for three or four debates on Seanad reform.  He knows the frustrations that exist.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is 100% sitting on Government in this regard.

Let us try to have the next 100 years for the Seanad look something more like an inclusive, democratic and exciting expression of the public's thematic interests and concerns, and of the passion the public showed in how they voted in 1979 and 2013.  Let it be very clear that we have heard the public in that regard.

People who are fortunate enough to get to third level and obtain a qualification are no more entitled or qualified to vote than people who, unfortunately, had to drop out at primary level, maybe halfway through secondary level or otherwise.  As long as that stands, the whole composition of the Seanad is questionable.  We already have provided that the electoral college for the university six can, without further ado, be increased to include graduates of all third level institutions, which would be some small step towards equity.

That is the rotten borough.  That is the rotten borough that successive Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed to tackle.  I agree that there should be no excuse for not extending the franchise in terms of university votes, but at least people who are graduates can vote, as opposed to the regular population, who have no vote whatsoever.  That is the elephant in the room, and it has been in the room for decades.  If we are going to talk about Seanad reform, let us be serious about it.<\/p> <p>What I would say to the Minister of State is that unless he is prepared to grasp this nettle, his name will go alongside all those of the other people who talk about Seanad reform and deliver nothing.  We need this place to be democratised, not just for the universities but also for the whole population.  That is the key issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#HH00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will need the wisdom of Solomon to answer all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#HH00400","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I again thank Senators Higgins, Ruane, Flynn and Black for amendments Nos. 13, 21, 24, 35, 36 and 44, which all relate to the franchise for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Before I speak specifically to the amendments, I appreciate the level of debate, in particular the very passionate debate by Senator McDowell and others yesterday and by Senator Higgins today.  I note that and I would say in response that we cannot be prescriptive about the piece of research the commission is going to carry out.<\/p> <p>On the point by Senator Gavan about the lack of democracy here, that is not the case.  Regardless of how Senators got here, they are representing the people.  I see that in the level of debate that takes place here on a weekly basis.  All of them do that very well.  It should be noted that, regardless of the franchise, when Senators are here, they are representing all of the people of Ireland.  That is something they all do very well and admirably, and it should be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>I cannot speak specifically to the points that Senator O'Sullivan raised with regard to the six university seats.  Again, that is another piece of research that could be carried out.  However, it is not something I will address today.<\/p> <p>Our primary objective here is to establish an electoral commission, which is a long-held objective.  It is about the robustness and strength of our democracy that the commission is going to give great credence to.  I note there was no agreement in the programme for government around Seanad reform, and the programme for government was negotiated by three political parties.  That is not to say that Opposition and Government parties cannot continue to push for that during the lifetime of this Government.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 13, 21 and 24 propose to give an coimisi&uacute;n new additional functions in reviewing and implementing the proposals of the Seanad reform implementation group and the Manning report, and reviewing the constituencies for Seanad &Eacute;ireann, having regard to any alterations to the electoral franchise for a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the criteria by which the Taoiseach may nominate a person as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  While I understand the motivation behind these amendments, I cannot accept them.  As I outlined yesterday, the approach to the initial functions of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in is balanced.  It brings in established functions, which are relatively self-contained from the outset, as well as a significant suite of new functions &ndash; a new research, advisory and public education function, online political advertising and oversight of the electoral register.  These initial functions will give an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in a solid foundation and allow it to build up its organisational and operational capacity gradually.  In addition, we will benefit from having a commission set up and running while at the same time making the preparations for the new additional functions to be transferred.<\/p> <p>An coimisi&uacute;n will be taking on a significant number of new and existing electoral functions from the outset.  I am mindful of the need for an coimisi&uacute;n to get established and to build up organisational capacity, and I do not intend to add to these functions at present.  Furthermore, an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in will prepare research programmes, conduct research on electoral policy and procedure and provide advice, as required.  An coimisi&uacute;n's research programmes will be prepared in consultation with the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage annually, so Senators do have the opportunity to provide their input into an coimisi&uacute;n's research priorities.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 35 seeks to establish an electoral register for Seanad &Eacute;ireann which would be maintained by an coimisi&uacute;n and proposes to extend the franchise for the Seanad to Irish citizens who are resident in Ireland, to citizens residing outside the State who hold a current and valid passport, to those entitled to Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland and to citizens holding a requisite qualification and who are graduates of an institution of higher education in the State, as well as the current electorate of serving Members of the D&aacute;il, Members of the outgoing Seanad and serving members of local authorities.  As I have indicated previously, this would mean that the Seanad would have a significantly wider franchise than that in place for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  At a D&aacute;il election, only Irish and British citizens ordinarily resident in a constituency who are aged 18 or over can vote.  This amendment would also create dual registers, one held by an coimisi&uacute;n and the other held by local authorities.  This is unnecessary duplication and would require careful consideration.  As the Senators are aware, Part 3 of this Bill provides for significant modernisation of the electoral registration process.  It would be prudent to allow this modernisation work to be completed.  For the foregoing reasons, I am not accepting amendment No. 35.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Amendment No. 36 requires the Minister to submit a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of the passing of this Act, outlining measures taken to reform the electoral franchise for the vocational panels and the university constituencies of the Seanad, as well as the criteria applied to the nomination of members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann under Article 18 of the Constitution.  The Bill does not provide that the Minister would have a role in reporting to the Oireachtas on electoral matters.  With the establishment of an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in, we will have an independent statutory body which can make recommendations and provide advice on electoral matters.  This is specifically provided for in chapter 9 of Part 2 of the Bill, which sets out in detail the research, advisory and voter education functions of an coimisi&uacute;n.  I do not propose to depart from the general principle set out in the Bill on research and advice on electoral matters and am therefore not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 44 seeks to amend section 94 of the Bill to allow a registration authority to enter the name of a person on the pending elector list in the register of electors of a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the scenario where the franchise for such elections is extended.  Section 94 of the Bill provides for the pre-registration of 16 and 17 year-olds on a pending electors list, and for the inclusion of these persons on the register from when they turn 18.  Currently, registration authorities do not manage the electoral register for Seanad &Eacute;ireann elections.  I note that this proposed amendment is framed on a conditional basis to provide for a situation where the franchise for such elections has been extended.  The extension of the franchise in elections for Seanad &Eacute;ireann would in itself require legislation to have effect and that would be the appropriate time for this type of arrangement or similar to be considered.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#HH00500","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I want to reply to the various points that have been made.  I agree that graduates should not have a privilege over others to vote.  The proposals we put forward from the implementation group sought, as far as possible without constitutional referendum, to ensure we would widen university franchise to all graduates, not just those with a degree but those with a diploma as well.  That was widening it as far as is possible within the requirement on graduates in the Constitution.  However, as was well put by Senator Gavan, there is a big elephant in the room when it comes to widening the franchise.  I have a constituency of 100,000 and I have supported the proposal that there would be a single and large constituency of all graduates with any diploma.  However, graduates of whatever level are entrusted with the opportunity and responsibility to choose between potential public representatives in this Chamber, whereas other members of this public who may not have a degree or diploma but who have great relevant experience, expertise, insight, opinion, view or perspective are not entrusted or given the opportunity to choose between potential public representatives in the Seanad.  They are required to have a councillor or other person vote on their behalf, which is phenomenally patronising, disempowering and inequitable.  We need to address the issues of the graduate constituency but it is no good widening that while still having a situation where a huge number of people in this State will never be able to choose between seven candidates who might be very different in what they offer.  The 15 different voices that might put themselves forward on the educational panel may have radically different things and expertise to offer to the debate.  That they would not have the opportunity to choose and participate in thematic discussion in the State is not acceptable.  I am bearing in mind that the proposals, to a larger degree than I would wish, still preserve the fact that there is a particular perspective that comes through from councillors but it also ensured that every member of the public would be asked their views in respect of the constitution of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>To simply suggest that there is a busy agenda ahead of the commission and that this is something that might be on its research agenda is not good enough.  Let us be clear; this is not an abstract topic or something that comes up now and again.  This is half of the legislative process in the Oireachtas and five of the ten Stages of legislation between these two Houses.  It matters who is here and who elects who is here.  It should be centre stage in the electoral commission's agenda.  To say it might be a research topic down the line as if it is an academic exercise is not enough; it needed to be signalled here.<\/p> <p>I am particularly concerned with the Minister of State's response to amendment No. 36 because it did not talk about the commission but about the Minister coming back.  The answer was that it is really the commission that will be doing things.  On the one hand the Government has not put Seanad reform on the agenda of the commission and on the other hand we are hearing that the Minister will not do anything about it either because there is an electoral commission now.  We cannot have a situation where we are not having cake and also not eating it whereby it is not on the electoral commission's agenda because the Government chose not to put it on the electoral commission's agenda and it will also no longer be on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.  I am not okay with the idea that I will be sitting here hearing Ministers say they will not say anything about Seanad reform forever because we have an electoral commission and it is its area when the Government has chosen to reject amendments that made it the electoral commission's business.  If the electoral commission is not doing it, and if it is not required to do it, then it remains for the Minister of the day to come up with proposals for what will come forward.  If we put that electoral commission as a box where we will park political responsibility for Seanad reform, that does not fly and it is a cop-out that is not acceptable.  The Government has chosen to not use the electoral commission as the tool to progress this and it cannot abdicate responsibility to a future potential research agenda that the electoral commission might independently take.  It is a political decision in moving forward on Seanad reform.<\/p> <p>I recognise that there are three parties in government and I know and acknowledge that the Minister of State's party would like to see this reform progressed.  Former Senator Grace O'Sullivan was also supportive of the implementation report but I will be clear that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, is the one who blocked it.  It will be the Government&rsquo;s responsibility and it will be clearly named as obstruction by political parties in government if we do not progress on Seanad reform.  There will be no acceptance from anybody in this House of a suggestion that somehow there is a new long finger in the research agenda of the electoral commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#JJ00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 31, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(i) to undertake the wholesale review of the Electoral Act 1997, including, inter alia, its provisions regarding political funding.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#JJ00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#JJ00500","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 31, line 18, after &ldquo;publish&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in plain language&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#JJ00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#JJ00800","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 16:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 31, line 20, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;print media such as newspapers,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KK00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KK00300","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 31, line 22, to delete &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KK00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KK00600","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 18 to 20, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

The Minister of State will recall there was strong agreement across the House in respect of the principle of these amendments.  Amendment No. 18 proposes that there would be a register of political parties, that it would be published on the commission&rsquo;s website and published in an accessible format.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 19 also addresses an important aspect for which there was strong support in the House from Government and Opposition Senators.  The Minister of State will recall the debate from yesterday.  In the time since, I hope he has taken the time to inquire about this aspect to see if there is any reason for this amendment not to be made.  The proposal is that the register of political parties would be caused to be published on the commission&rsquo;s website, as well as the constitution, a memorandum of association and any other such documents or written rules provided to the register.  The legislation provides that these documents would be supplied in the context of registering a political party.  The point was made clearly that these documents should be available to the public.<\/p> <p>These documents are important for a few reasons.  One concerns the public being clear about the constitutions of the political parties they are deciding between when making their electoral decisions.  Another reason is that the availability of these documents would be important to encourage political participation among members of the public, and, as I mentioned in yesterday&rsquo;s debate, ensuring that students, including school students, those engaged in CSPE and other others, would be able to see the constitution, the mechanisms, the rules and the workings of political parties.  That would allow people to see how decision-making processes, even within political parties, can be influenced, where they can have a role and where they can bring motions.<\/p> <p>Therefore, there is a transparency issue in this regard, but there is also the aspect of encouraging political participation and an empowerment perspective in respect of voters and potential political participants.

These amendments were previously tabled by Deputy Nash in the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>In respect of amendment No. 18, when bringing across the 1992 Act&rsquo;s existing provisions in respect of the making available of the register, I removed the stipulation that the register be made available for inspection at the offices of the registrar, making the text in section 51 of this Bill more general so that it does not contain an implication that the register is a physical document that must be inspected at the registrar&rsquo;s offices.<\/p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 20, as I mentioned, the existing precedent is that the register of political parties is published online several times per year.  This will continue with the transfer of the register to the commission.  In respect of its publication on the commission&rsquo;s website in an accessible format, as I mentioned earlier on, the European Union (Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector) Bodies Regulations 2020 will apply to the website and content produced by the commission. <\/p> <p>Therefore, I am of the view that these amendments are not required and I do not propose to accept them.<\/p> <p>In respect of amendment No. 19, which proposes the publication of additional material on the governance arrangements of political parties, I will set out the information included on the register at present and that is published online by the Clerk of the D&aacute;il several times per year.

The proposed amendment offers an additional measure of transparency but, as it only proposes the publication of the governance documents submitted with the party&rsquo;s initial application for inclusion on the register, it does not encompass situations where changes are made to the governance documents in question over time, as would be likely.

It might be helpful for the Seanad if, at the outset, I outline the law and practice in the area of D&aacute;il constituency size.  Under Article 16.2.6&deg; of the Constitution, no law may be enacted by the Oireachtas providing for fewer than three members for a D&aacute;il constituency.  The relevant parts of the Electoral Act 1997 are being retained in the Bill and provide that an coimisi&uacute;n will make recommendations based on three-, four- or five-seat constituencies.<\/p> <p>While in the early years of the State there were seven-, eight- and even nine-seat constituencies, constituency size in Ireland has been restricted to three, four and five seats since 1947.  At present, the 39 D&aacute;il constituencies are split with 13 five-seat constituencies, 17 four-seat constituencies and nine three-seat constituencies.  It is worth noting that we have to go back to 1923 to find a time when we had fewer three-seat constituencies.  That was a time when constituencies ranged in size form three seats to nine seats.  In my view, there needs to be a reasonable choice of constituency sizes to produce constituencies that make sense to people on the ground by, for example, enclosing entire communities or adhering to obvious physical features.  The three-, four- and five-seat arrangement has served us well and strikes a reasonable balance.<\/p> <p>In relation to amendment No. 23, I would not be in favour of placing any further restriction on an coimisi&uacute;n along the lines proposed.  It is important that an coimisi&uacute;n has a reasonable degree of flexibility when making recommendations on constituency formation.  The amendment gives us no guidance on what circumstances would permit three-seat constituencies or indeed enable a larger number of five-seat constituencies.  The nature of the task of constituency revision calls for a workable menu of different-sized constituencies and the arrangements proposed in the Bill achieve this.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 25 is also related to the terms of reference of the electoral commission when it is reviewing constituency boundaries.  Section 56(2)(c) provides that when an coimisi&uacute;n is reviewing D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituency boundaries the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable.  However, section 56(4) provides that this requirement will not apply to a boundary of a city or any boundary between any two of the counties of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and south Dublin.  Again, this is in line with the current terms of reference for constituency commissions set out in the Electoral Act 1997.<\/p> <p>The effect of the proposed amendment would require an coimisi&uacute;n to avoid, as far as practicable, breaching county boundaries, including those boundaries in Dublin, when making recommendations formulating D&aacute;il constituencies.  The boundaries of the 32 counties of Ireland have been in existence for centuries.  In the past 200 years, these counties have become a well-established focus for community activity and so the requirement to generally align constituency boundaries with county boundaries makes sense.  However, the effect of this amendment would be to impose greater restrictions on an coimisi&uacute;n and would remove the avoidance of doubt type provisions that exist relating to city boundaries.  The existing provision will give an coimisi&uacute;n some flexibility in dealing with our cities, including Dublin city and county which is the most densely populated part of Ireland.<\/p> <p>The reality is that urban development around cities has long since spilled over into the adjoining counties.  Many people living outside city boundaries feel a strong degree of affinity and loyalty to their city and would prefer to be included in city constituencies.  For these reasons, we should not require the commission to avoid, where practicable, breaching city boundaries or indeed the administrative boundaries in Dublin.  It would be inadvisable, at this point, to tie the commission's hands in this way and so I do not favour any alteration to an coimisi&uacute;n's terms of reference in this regard.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 22, 23 or 25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL00500","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 45, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:  \t&quot;(3) When preparing a report in relation to the constituencies for the election of members to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Commission shall seek to secure that its recommendations taken as a whole would result in as small a number of constituencies returning a smaller number of members, and in as large a number of constituencies returning a larger number of members, as is reasonably practicable.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL00700","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL00800","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 45, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/>&quot;(4) When preparing a report under <i>subsection (1)(a)(iii)<\/i>, the Commission shall have regard to the following:  \t(a) any alterations to the electoral franchise for a constituency of Seanad &Eacute;ireann;<br \/><br \/>and<br \/><br \/>(b) any alterations to the criteria by which the Taoiseach may nominate a person as a member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL01100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 45, to delete lines 10 to 12. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL01300","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL01400","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 26 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 27 to 29, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

One part of it is very similar to that debate and similar to the amendments tabled by Senators Higgins and Ruane in terms of extending the franchise to bring more people into voting.  We are proposing that the commission should be able to conduct research and make recommendations with regard to mandatory voting, lowering the voting age, which ties in with the vote-16 amendments from Senator Ruane and Warfield, and also extending the franchise to non-citizens in the State, which is in later amendments in my name.  Many people who have been living here for a number of years are not citizens of the State.  Our citizenship is very expensive.  People who are members of the European Union get all the social benefits associated with membership of the EU.  However, we have one of the highest citizenship fees in Europe at &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 so many of them do not become citizens and do not have the same say in the democratic processes they would otherwise have.  I know people from Spain, France and England who have never voted in a referendum campaign because they cannot justify the expense of becoming a citizen to be able to do that.<\/p><p>Then there is extending the franchise to Irish citizens who are resident outside the State.  It comes later.  What we have recommended is 15 years, which is what is in place in the UK.  In European Commission reports the Commission has admonished Ireland for denying the franchise to citizens who are living abroad.  It argues that it should be extended because of the right to free movement, and that even if somebody is living outside the State for more than 15 years, the person should have the right to vote where the person is ordinarily resident.<\/p><p>The first part of the amendment is concerned with opinion polls, voter education with regard to opinion polls and a framework for broadcast election debates, including a regulatory framework to secure fairness and impartiality.  This comes out of the debate we had in 2020 when a big head of steam was built up about denying Sinn F&eacute;in a platform in the political party debates during the general election.  This would remove it out of the casualness, as it were, that currently exists and the electoral commission would draw up a framework for who is and is not included.  To do that would be a good step because we saw it become a political issue, and that issue actually moved the polls in the last general election.  The amendment would give the commission the responsibility to have a look at that and to develop a framework for both opinion polls and election debates, because political parties, RT&Eacute; or independent media outlets doing that can significantly impact the outcome of a general election.  We want to put that to an impartial body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LL02000","speaker":"1672","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will first speak briefly to Senator Moynihan's amendments, which I support.  I have participated in both Seanad and European Parliament elections.  Sometimes the rules seem to be made up almost each time regarding how to approach the issues of broadcast time and so forth, so the concept of best standards in that is a very good idea.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will also be aware that we strongly support the proposals for the lowering of the voting age.  My colleague and others, along with the legislation sponsored by Senator Warfield, have pressed in the past for the vote for 16-year-olds in European and local elections.  I strongly believe that is the direction we need to take, so these are useful and important proposals.<\/p> <p>Our amendments are similar.  They set forward matters for the research agenda.  These are not academic pieces of research but matters that need early consideration and scrutiny.  Amendment No. 28 is a matter that has been identified previously by the women's caucus in the Oireachtas as an issue of concern across the board for members of all parties.  It is gender quotas in local elections.  This had been identified as one of the key issues that has to be addressed to ensure we have women engaging in politics.  Indeed, these are gender quotas so in the future they apply to both genders, but at present they are specifically addressing the fact that we have inadequate representation and participation of women in local elections.  The idea of gender quotas is something that has been called for by local authority representatives and councillors from all parties in the past.  It was an issue that was identified as a concern and which Members of the Oireachtas have echoed and supported.  It absolutely should be on the agenda early in the lifetime of the commission so that, ideally, we would be looking at these gender quotas being in place for the next local elections.  We know that quotas have made and can make a difference.  This should be an issue that would expedited as an early item for the commission to examine.  That is why amendment No. 28 is important.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 29 looks at the wider question of participation by groups.  It is not simply that one has the right to vote.  It is for the general public good that we would have all persons participating fully in democracy.  Decisions where more people are involved are better decisions.  They lead to better outcomes, better social cohesion and to greater ownership of our political decision-making.  That is why it refers to participation in elections by women, which I have spoken about, and people with a disability.  We have highlighted those who are LGBTI, and there may be issues regarding names and registers in that regard.  There are also persons who come from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, Travellers and other ethnic minorities, and some of those issues have been mentioned, as well as persons who are younger, really proactive members to encourage and support participation by those under the age of 25 years, and measures to actively support participation by persons who are serving custodial sentences, so they are aware of and able to access their rights in terms of electoral participation.<\/p> <p>This is not an exclusionary list.  It is putting the point that participation in elections should be a goal of the commission.  It is not simply something we regulate as a process but a goal of participation, and these are just some of the areas we have suggested for particular regard.  They certainly do not leave out other areas where participation may need to be encouraged.<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will consider taking amendments Nos. 28 and 29 on board.  I believe there is strong support for amendment No. 28 in particular.  It is an issue that has arisen repeatedly in respect of local elections and equitable representation and participation in those elections.  Many Members in different parties have faced real obstacles in that regard and this is a chance for progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#MM00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I will be brief.  Amendments Nos. 27 to 29, inclusive, are self-explanatory so I will not go into great detail on them.  I will mention two points.  On the last occasion we discussed this Bill I spoke about lowering the age to 16 years, and the Minister of State told the House he was supportive.  It is about engaging with people.  I also pointed out how young people are so actively involved in activism and various campaigns on social issues, environmental issues and so forth.  They want to have a voice.  As I said on the last occasion, many of them influenced their parents to vote because they had that type of influence.  I attributed some of that to the green wave, notwithstanding the Green Party's skills and abilities.  It was palpable during the last election the number of young people who were asking their parents to vote for the Green Party.  They could articulate it very well.  Of course, when one has a green slogan it is self-explanatory and it is a great advantage because people know what green means and stands for.  We should not lose the focus on that, and I know the Minister of State believes the new commission will look at it.<\/p> <p>People talk about promoting women, people with disabilities, LGBTI people and persons with disadvantage, but they are only some categories.  There is no exhaustive list.  I want to talk in more general terms about participation of all citizens.  I will single out two areas.  Ageism is alive and well in our society.  I spoke to a former very active member of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, indeed very well known to many Members of the House, who said to me a few weeks ago, \"I have nothing to contribute\".<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I said she was involved in the GAA, principal of a school, a senior union activist in the INTO, involved in parish life and Tidy Towns and that she did not know it but was political already and an activist.  She felt there was no place for her in political life.  She had more to contribute because she is now retired and has loads of time on her hands.  We have to be careful.  We do not want to stereotype or streamline a particular group.  We want everybody who wishes to participate in the background or at the front in elections.  We should be careful not to pigeonhole anybody.  Everybody should be encouraged.  Some groups need an extra hand and support to get started.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 29 references persons serving custodial sentences.  I have sat on a number or prison boards, am familiar with prison reform and acknowledge the work Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Bacik have done in that area.  They too are citizens.  People have human rights and want to participate.  The fact they are serving a custodial sentence does not mean they are not political or that they do not have a contribution to make.  They may not be there for very long.  It is important we facilitate all groups and I was pleased to see that amendment No. 29 singles out persons serving a custodial sentence.  It is not something we hear much about in terms of this legislation.  People tend to think when a person is serving a custodial sentence, he or she is at the end of the barrel and a bit of a waster, but these are humans, citizens and people who want to make good.  I like the broad thrust of real engagement with the widest group of people.  We are a diverse people and nation so let us encourage everyone.<\/p><p>I commend these three excellent amendments and will support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#MM00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I support amendment No. 28, which concerns the commission making recommendations about gender quotas at local elections.

Quotas are applied in the D&aacute;il around political party funding, but there must be a way, if we use our collective experience, to come up with a solution to implement quotas for local elections.  The European Parliament has historically been much better in this regard.  The D&aacute;il is probably only now where that parliament was in the 1990s.

It has immense potential.  I do not want to be prescriptive or restrict the commission in trying to achieve that but at pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the Oireachtas committee went beyond what we had tasked it with to bring in expert groups to give their opinion on it.  That included the Irish Traveller Movement Pavee Point and many civil society organisations which had a strong role in shaping the Bill.<\/p> <p>I am deeply politically committed to the commission having a strong role in ensuring we have an active, participatory democracy that is inclusive of everybody here.  It currently is not.  We know that, but it is still a good democracy and has potential.  There is much more we can do.  The advocacy function the commission will have has the power to transform over the coming years and beyond how we bring people into the political system and encourage them.  In many cases, we are talking about the capacity of people to participate at a basic level of society.  We have to address that at community level.  For that reason, I think the commission will have an active role to play.  Other actors will have a role to play in that regard as well.  It is critical.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is doing quite an amount of work on gender quotas.

It is critical that all of us, particularly political parties, have a significant role in that.

As I have mentioned previously, I am conscious of an coimisi&uacute;n's independence and have avoided being prescriptive in the Bill in requiring it to conduct particular pieces of research.  Notwithstanding this, the programme for Government proposes several items of research for an coimisi&uacute;n and I intend to request that an coimisi&uacute;n consider these from the outset.  These include researching the potential for expansion of postal voting and the Scottish experience of lowering the voting age.  Increasing voter turnout and participation in our democratic processes has been a priority for me in the preparation of this Bill.  In this regard, an coimisi&uacute;n's public education and public information functions empower it to work to increase public awareness of and participation in the State's electoral democratic processes.  While I intend that an coimisi&uacute;n will have autonomy in deciding how to fulfil its role, I envisage its work will have an emphasis on under-represented groups.<\/p> <p>Under section 63, an coimisi&uacute;n will set its research priorities via annual research programmes.  These programmes will be subject to consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The committee will have the opportunity to interact directly with an coimisi&uacute;n on shaping research priorities via consultation on the development of research programmes and through six-monthly progress reports provided by an coimisi&uacute;n to the committee.<\/p> <p>In respect of the extension of the franchise, the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill 2019 was published on 16 September 2019.

They have the cumulative effect of providing the Minister with the power to impose a levy not only on single-use disposable cups but also on certain re-usable alternatives to those cups that are supplied to the consumer below a certain price point, which will be set by the Minister in secondary legislation.  The amendments have the same policy objective as the amendment proposed by Senator Pauline O'Reilly on Committee Stage, namely, to address the potential for nominally reusable \"flimsy\" plastic cups to be supplied for free to consumers as a means of avoiding the disposable cup levy.  I acknowledge that the form of the present amendments differs greatly from that proposed by the Senator.  However, I am satisfied following discussions with the Office of the Attorney General that the amendments as they are set out here achieve that policy objective while also cohering with the wider architecture of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 define two new classes of reusable item, \"re-usable alternative items\" and \"relevant re-usable alternative items\".  Amendment No. 10 then expands the definition of \"single-use item\" to include relevant reusable alternative items.  These amended definitions then facilitate amendment No. 33, which amends section 11(1)(a) to allow for environmental levies to be applied to such class or classes of reusable alternative items as may be prescribed in secondary legislation.  When so prescribed, these class or classes are then treated as single-use items for the purpose of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>Amendment No. 36 then amends section 11(2) to make unambiguously clear that the price at which an item is supplied can be a factor in the level of material wastage associated with that item, including where it is supplied for free.  These changes will cumulatively allow me to specify in regulations that, for example, the supply of plastic cups to customers below a minimum price point will incur the levy.  This addresses the potential problem of flimsy plastic cups as raised by Senator Pauline O'Reilly and referred to as well by Senators Dooley and McGahon.  The remainder of the Government amendments are consequential technical drafting amendments to ensure consistency between the new provisions and the language used in the rest of the Bill.  There are other amendments in this grouping that are not Government amendments so I will allow the proposers to speak on those.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS00400","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":366,"content":"<p>On a point of order, is amendment No. 33 included in that group?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS00500","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>It is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS00600","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":368,"content":"<p>It is just that it is not on my list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS00700","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":369,"content":"<p>It is on my list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS00800","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":370,"content":"<p>It is included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS00900","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":371,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 33 is not listed on this-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS01000","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>It is on my list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS01100","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":373,"content":"<p>It is not on this list so there is a lack of clarity on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS01200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>It is obviously a typo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS01300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>If non-Government amendments are included, perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach might indicate which ones are included.

I recognise that Senator Pauline O'Reilly and others raised important points regarding flimsy reusable items and that some of these are being addressed.  We will come later to amendments addressing some of the other important factors that need to looked at, for example, the use of virgin plastic and others.  It is regrettable that the Bill as a whole has not been more ambitious when we looked at the wider scope of the circular economy.  There has been a lot of discussion about which cup versus which other cup or whether cups are half full or half empty.  The point is that they are still just cups.  The fact that the debate to date has largely focused on the issue of cups when we have massively important issues to address not simply at consumption point but in terms of production point in the circular economy is perhaps reflective of a lack of ambition.

It should not be solely a matter of concern with regard to single-use items or cups.  It is a general issue.  Again, it is one that was specifically identified by the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action as an issue around manufacturing and production and the fact that there should not only be a levy in terms of single-use items but around the use of virgin plastic in manufacturing.  I should make clear that amendment No. 37 is not in any way suggesting that using recycled plastic should give you any kind of exemption from levies.  It is more about saying that there may need to be a higher levy point to the maximum of the scope that is within the Bill where virgin plastic is being used.  Again, I am limited in that regard to attaching it to those single-use items such as cups but in fact, we really should not at this point be seeing virgin plastic being used for almost anything.  It is something that needs to be discouraged.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Again, if that is an item which can be used five, six, ten, 20 or 30 times, it is still a problem if we are using virgin plastic, especially in view of the vast amounts of plastic already in circulation in the world and the direct fossil fuel implications of the use of new plastics.  It is an area in which we should have harder measures.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 43, I have again specified that there is perhaps a need for clarity with one particular category.  The Minister of State and I discussed this previously.  There are customers who are persons with a disability and we are balancing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability, UNCRPD.  A certain item may be designated as single-use plastic but I almost think it could perform two uses in that it is performing the designated use and it performs a use relating to the needs of a person with a disability.  There are circumstances whereby in the case of a lack of appropriate alternatives being provided or developed, persons with disabilities rely on the use of plastic objects.  Given the Indecon report on the cost of disability, which we know is substantial, we do not want the inadvertent effect of increasing that cost of disability for persons who may need such items on a regular basis.  It is something to be considered in the nuance of the development of the levy.<\/p><p>There are a few ways to approach that matter and it has been discussed in a few different ways.  This is just one example of how provision might be made.  Again, in general, I really regret we are tweaking such a narrow area of operation rather than maybe introducing massively ambitious initiatives.  We will come to amendments in that regard later.  As we tweak the levies relating to single-use items, these are two factors that I ask be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#SS02000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>Without the normal introduction, the next speaker is Senator Pauline O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#TT00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I thank the staff because there are a number of amendments replacing the one amendment I had in respect of this matter on Committee Stage.  The matter was raised by some paper cup manufacturers, but we all saw it as a committee.  All of us present attend the climate action committee and we know people can be encouraged to use cheap plastic alternatives that are effectively single-use items, although they may be used a couple of times.  The amendment I tabled on Committee Stage sought to achieve some kind of regulation to prohibit such action.<\/p> <p>Senators McGahon and Dooley raised this point because a particular paper cup manufacturer used the point as an example of a levy being put on its items but not on a cheap alternative to that item.  All round, this is the fairest thing to do.  I repeat what I said last week, which is that in the hierarchy of waste, not using something in the first place gets the highest priority.  We should not be looking at recycling or composting as an alternative to reuse.  It is not the same and such activities are much further down the hierarchy in tackling waste.  That is why it is absolutely correct to put a levy on all single-use items, including paper.  I am very supportive of the amendments and the Bill in general, which works in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#TT00300","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and Senator O'Reilly for their work in bringing forward a sensible amendment.  It does not solve the problem entirely but it goes part of the way.  The concerns I had, raised with me by Cup Print and others, were that we were potentially eliminating the option for a paper cup and replacing it with an option for hard plastic.  I did not take the concern on board just because it was coming from Cup Print but because I looked at the volume of plastic involved.  I get fully the hierarchy mentioned by Senator O'Reilly but we must really consider the volumes.  The volume of plastic involved in the manufacturing of a flimsy, cheap alternative that might be comparable with a paper cup with a levy attached would do much more damage to the environment than a paper cup with a small amount of film on the inside.  It is from the perspective of volume use that I make the argument.<\/p> <p>Littering is another matter.  I spoke at length the last day about this and I do not intend to repeat myself.  We must find an appropriate manner in this country for the collection of waste.  As far as we can, we must limit the supply of material that can be cast aside after single use, and that is important.  In parallel with that, we must have a collection system that is fit for purpose and will help to reduce the phenomenal ongoing level of littering.  We have a mentality in this country of just discarding certain items.  I see it in clothing, and although it may not be for this debate, there are plastics used in the production of clothing.  I have a family and I see that although clothing is not quite a single-use item, some of the chain stores produce flimsy items of clothing at a very cheap rate.  That generates consumer demand for changes of colour, style and you name it.  It may cost &euro;4, &euro;5 or &euro;6 for a t-shirt, for example, and those items will not be worn too often in this day and age.  It creates demand.<\/p> <p>A host of measures will be needed to address how we manage our business with overall footprint on the environment, whether it is consumable paper cups, throwaway t-shirts or cheap alternative materials that are a significant drain on a limited resource.  We are moving in the right direction but we have much more to do and a short enough period in which to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#TT00400","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins spoke to amendment No. 43.  I recognise and agree with this amendment but will not be accepting it as the power to provide exemptions in regulations is already provided in the Bill, and I consider those regulations to be the appropriate vehicle to consider and address all the detailed impact of any levy.  In that regard, as I previously indicated, the draft regulations to implement the levy on disposable hot drink cups will be put to public consultation after enactment of the Bill.  I will be requesting my officials to specifically invite organisations representing persons with disabilities to contribute to that consultation.<\/p> <p>With regard to amendment No. 37, I understand the Senator's concerns regarding the use of virgin raw plastic.  I cannot accept the amendment, however, because, as stated, achieving a circular transition is a much broader issue than just plastic.  The purpose of the levy is to influence people's behaviour away from single use, not just of plastic items, but in all areas of our daily lives.  As Senator Dooley states, we must consider volume.  If we recycle a cup, we can get a second use from it, but if we have a strong and durable plastic cup, it could be used 1,000 times.  We must consider the volume of materials being used.  There is a difference between virgin and recycled plastic, but there is also a major and much larger difference between a single-use item and an item that could be used 1,000 times.<\/p> <p>The objective of the policy in this Bill is to reduce the annual consumption of all types of disposable cups and subsequently other forms of single-use disposable packing by inducing people to change their behaviour and switch to using reusable cups.  The objective of the levy, therefore, is to change behaviour, preventing the use of single-use items in the first place and thereby preventing the continuous unnecessary use of resources that are required to go into the production and the disposal of single-use items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#TT00500","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 2:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 20 to 27, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.

I am seeking to insert a definition of \"climate justice\" into the Bill by means of amendment No. 3.  This is the definition that Senators from all Opposition groups sought to insert into the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 last summer.  The reason I am seeking to insert the definition into the Bill relates to a core issue, namely, that the Bill is somewhat too narrowly focused on Ireland and the Irish economy.  This is evident in the fact the Bill has such a strong focus on consumption and levies at point of consumption, and does not have measures that are sufficiently strong or robust in respect of manufacturing or the supply chain, which are very important issues that should be addressed, should be central to this and should fall in line with, for example, the due diligence debates taking place at EU level.<\/p> <p>When we look at the circular economy in the round, we cannot solely focus on our Irish economy existing separately from the rest of the world.  We need to look to the impacts on the rest of the world, in addition to the economic activity of wealthy countries and how it worsens the climate crisis for those in the global south.  This has been spoken about in the context of issues such as the current famine in the Horn of Africa and the significantly worsening climate emergency, but it is also very important when we look to things such as scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, including supply chain emissions under scope 3.  That is why we should have a stronger international focus and a stronger focus on the supply chain and manufacturing.  It is to facilitate this that at later points in the Bill I seek to insert the definition of climate justice.  It is the definition that reflects the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change commitments to equity and common but differentiated responsibilities in respect of capacities and capabilities.  We will have other amendments in areas such as fast fashion, which touch on some of those supply chain issues and scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 4 outlines a definition of just transition we seek to insert into the legislation.  This definition defines just transition as a transition that ensures the economic, environmental and social consequences of the necessary fast but fair transformation of economies and societies \"are managed in ways that maximise opportunities of decent work for all, reduce inequalities, promote social justice, and support industries, workers and communities who are negatively affected\".  It would be good if we began to have stronger and clearer definitions of just transition in legislation.  Sometimes, just transition gets invoked in an abstract way, as if it means, for example, we keep things the same whereas the key to just transition is fast and fair.  We need to make these transitions but do so in a fair way.  We need to start clarifying that and making it clearer and more evident in legislation.  This is an amendment that would allow and make clear legislation should operate in a way that is equitable and affects those principles I have talked about in reducing poverty and supporting social justice.<\/p> <p>As a principle of equity, there is a problem if the main measures we take are continually focused on the point of consumption.  When the Minister of State spoke to the last suite of amendments, he talked about affecting behaviour.  It is not sufficient or adequate that we focus constantly on persons as consumers because the State also has citizens who have elected us as decision makers, not to solely advise them what to do as consumers, but to also regulate industries and sectors and put hard and proper measures in place in areas such as manufacturing.  There is something about moving things to the consumer choice space and seeking to influence that, while failing to bring in hard regulatory measures in areas such as manufacturing, public procurement and others, which, in itself, is inequitable.  It does not deal with those who tend to profiteer at the highest levels from bad practices and those who have profited in the past from the production of, for example, fast fashion.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 20 outlines a provision relating to the circular economy fund for insertion into the Bill.  I will not move it because I realise there is a problem with it in that it is limited to financial institutions in the State.  It should have been amended to include financial institutions more widely in the EU.  I want to avoid circumstances where we have inappropriate financial institutions involved in this operation.  The amendment might need to be reworded so I will not proceed with it.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 21 seeks to add a provision that moneys may be paid out of the fund \"to assist [in] the establishment of public-public partnerships for research and development in the area of the circular economy and waste management;&rdquo;.\"  Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 relate to a much wider issue that affects research in Ireland.  It is the fact we see a major emphasis on research in commercial areas around the development of products to be marketed, but nowhere near the same emphasis on the frontiers of blue-sky research, research for the public good, research, for example, into social processes and other areas, and all the other mechanisms that, in the context of a circular economy, may in some cases lead to a shrinking of certain areas of the economy.  That is what we might actually need in certain areas.  It might lead to changes in social practices and to situations whereby we may have products and measures that are less profitable for everybody but lead to greater outcomes.  For example, simple measures such as the provision of public water fountains.  This comes from a wider concern I have, which is that again and again I have pressed for public-public research in order that we might look for public solutions in certain areas.  These may be about removing areas from commercial activity and delivering them in a different way to make sure people's needs and wants are being addressed but not always through consumption of products.  This is an area of important research.  The circular economy fund should contribute to that.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 22 seeks to add that the circular economy fund would be used \"to assist the establishment, equipping and, where appropriate, the operation of facilities which provide repair services\".  This might not be profitable.  It may well be these are non-profit or community repair services but it would be an example of just transition in practice, in effect, if we were to use the fund not simply to develop new commercial products but ensure that people can get longer lifetimes from their goods.  That would be a signal.  This relates to just transition, but Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment, VOICE, Ireland has explicitly suggested that a right to repair should be regulated for.  If we look to things such as repair caf&eacute;s and men's sheds, these are the kinds of measures that are just transition in practice.  This would send a signal that, when we talk about the circular economy, it is not just about extra levies on the things people buy.  It is about supporting people to get greater value from the things they own.  That would be a very practical measure.  I hope the Minister of State takes amendment No. 22 on board.  It is a very decent and constructive proposal around addressing the issue of planned obsolescence, especially in electronics, which is a significant area of concern.  We simply cannot afford to have electronics that become obsolete.  Recycling is not adequate.  These are not captured in that single-use space, but they are a significant resource management problem.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 23 seeks to provide that the circular economy fund might be used \"to develop public industrial washing facilities which support the use of reusable food and drink containers by local businesses and public services;&rdquo;.\"  The State is planning to have one industrial washing facility at present.  We should have one in every region.  This is one of the absolute game changers we could have.  It is one of key obstacles that comes up again and again.  I even know it from the place where I buy juice, where I have asked the same containers to be refilled but it cannot be done because of health and safety measures and other issues.  We should have industrial washing facilities that allow businesses to, at scale, reach relevant hygiene and other standards in the sterilisation of containers in order that they can be reused.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In many cases, people will go to the same places again and again.  Public services that provide people with foods should be able to access these industrial washing facilities.  This could be a significant measure.  This is the kind of concrete support for businesses and services that is needed.  This is not just for the individual.  It is fine for me when I am carrying around a coffee cup, but most people will not carry around every food container and most businesses will not be able to fill an individual's food containers.  However, businesses can and should be able to not use disposable materials, but to take materials back from their customers, have them industrially washed, and then reused.  These would be significant.  It is almost moving back to the tiffin boxes that are used in other parts of the world that are ahead of us on the issue of reuse of a materials.  This is one of the biggest measures that we could take to make this possible, especially for smaller businesses that may not be able to have large-scale sterilisation facilities on-site.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 24 adds the provision that in dispensing money from the circular economy fund, the Minister may dispense funds to assist, support and promote initiatives to restore, conserve and renovate buildings to reduce embodied emissions that result from demolition.  One of the biggest areas of emissions is from buildings and from the demolition of buildings.  If a building is demolished, it does not matter if the building that is built to replace it afterwards is covered in solar panels and whatever else, it will still be 70 years before those embodied emissions are compensated for.  These emissions are presenting themselves in the period where we are under most pressure, which is this next decade when e need to look at every measure we can take to reduce embodied emissions going forward.<\/p><p>My next point relates to the issue of repair and, in some cases, a more specialist form of repair.  Sometimes we focus on innovation in new areas.  There is much talk about technologies and about how they are going to help us.  However, one of the most important aspects of the circular economy is old skills that are time intensive but that, in many cases, may have fallen out of favour.  We need new apprenticeships in these areas.  Let us consider all the shutters across Ireland that were painted shut and the difference they make in older buildings.  We must consider how we can repair buildings.  There are specific skills in those areas.  While they may seem to be heritage skills, they are also key climate skills and key to the efficient management of resources in minimising emissions.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 25 seeks to add a new provision that the Minister may dispense funds from the circular economy fund to assist, support or promote actions or initiatives undertaken by international organisations and NGOs to further climate justice.  I have said that climate justice needs to be reflected in this Bill.  The amendment is a tangible measure that could be taken to further climate justice.  I am thinking of international NGOs, as well as indigenous groups that have been at the forefront of ending wasteful practices down the line in the supply chain in, for example, the areas of mineral extraction and precious metals extraction.  NGOs have been advocating strongly for climate justice.  That advocacy is crucial to make the links with the supply chain and to highlight the practices in fast fashion and other areas.  One of the important things that these NGOs often do is raise awareness in development education in Ireland among the public around which companies, not just in the shop, have ethical and environmentally sound practices.  They address sustainability change, they challenge that and they empower and support citizens and customers to demand more information.  That is why I mention international NGOs in that context.  In some cases, it is a matter of having groups that are in Ireland but are making the links with others internationally.  This is so that we do not only start looking at the issue once it hits the shop floor and we are able to have these conversations because climate change is a global threat.  It needs global co-operation.  Ireland has a record in this.  It has spoken at the UN and it has claimed to have a strong commitment to the role of civil society internationally in climate change.  This is an opportunity to put that into effect.  <\/p><p>I apologise that this is such a large grouping of amendments.  I will not move amendment No. 26 because it is not a material change.  It is necessary because of the wording that is already there.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 27, again, seeks to improve transparency and accountability in the legislation.  It seeks to add that when a committee is established under subsection (14) to advise the Minister with respect to the performance of her functions under subsections (9) or (12), that where a Minister has a material interest in a matter that is under consideration by the committee, he or she would have to declare that interest and would subsequently recuse himself or herself from such deliberations.  This would be important in a situation whereby there is a committee that is to advise the Minister, and one of those members has an interest.  It is making sure that there are provisions such as declarations of interest extend down the line.  I tabled similar amendments to both the Land Development Agency Act and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, , both of which were accepted.  It improves transparency and accountability and it makes it clear that we do not have any case of, or even a perception of a risk of, there being undue interests at play in the advice that a Minister may receive.  I would urge the Minister of State to, therefore, accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#UU00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I believe that all the items specified in the amendments are addressed in the legislation.  I value the thought and time that has gone into considering them and they will all be open for discussion when the circular economy fund opens.  Section 8(9) provides for how moneys from the fund may be used.  It is a broadly drafted provision.  It provides for a wide range of purposes relating to the protection of the environment and the transition to a circular economy.

We know how much financial accountability in terms of the supply chain often disappears but in terms of emissions, the margin for error is even less and the margin for reclaiming ground, such as the accountancy tricks in terms of emissions, is far more serious in that there is no coming back from runaway climate change.  In that regard, stringency in that area, and clarity and transparency, is important.<\/p><p>I will press some of the amendments in areas that, I believe, are important because I would like to see them in the Bill.  I would like to be guaranteed that they would be part of the work of the circular economy fund rather than merely hoping that they might become such.<\/p><p>In terms of amendment No. 27, I accept, as it is not Committee Stage, we cannot debate back and forth but I would like to clarify that only public servants who are bound by that public service code will be in those sub-committees because I suppose that provides the guarantee.  If that is covered but there is a risk of there being any other persons who may be part of those committees, this measure becomes crucial.  It is not clear.  Is it the case that it will only be public services or members of Departments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#VV00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Likely that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#WW00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>It is likely.

According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, transport is one of the largest sources of energy-related CO2 emissions in Ireland.  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, it was responsible for over 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2019.<\/p> <p>It is a sector which has emission reduction targets but the carbon budgets excluded emissions resulting from aviation and shipping.  I also note that the State has been quite a bad actor in respect of transport emissions, specifically, for example, in terms of subsidisation of fossil fuels in the sector.  The Government provides an excise duty exemption on jet kerosene for domestic and international commercial aviation which came to &euro;634 million in 2019.  That &euro;634 million in jet kerosene subsidies, that is, fossil fuel subsidies for jet kerosene, makes some of those funds on circular economy and on peatlands look fairly small.  There is no point in giving with one hand and taking with the other.  The reason that it is relevant in this context is because, as I have highlighted, matters such as supply chain and journey length are relevant in terms of the circular economy and in its emissions.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 12 seeks the deletion of section 7(6) to replace it with a stronger provision around green public procurement.  As the Minister of State will be aware, I have a strong passion for public procurement.  I brought forward legislation in this area.  The climate committee's recommendation 13 was clear that explicit measures should be taken in the Bill in terms of sound principles in the design, procurement, package, logistics, retail, repairability, etc., around public procurement.  Recommendation 58 was that green public procurement should be placed on a statutory basis, that it is not sufficient that we have general aspirations for green public procurement and that we need laws around green public procurement.  This was an opportunity.  If we talk about trying to change consumer behaviour, we have to remember that the State is the largest consumer in the State in terms of the largest customer and the largest purchaser of goods and services.  If the State gets it right, it will set the tone for industry.  That is why having those standards built into law is important.  We spent &euro;12 billion in public contracts for goods, services and works in 2019.  There have been guidelines but we need to have those on a stronger basis.  I will not discuss this area further as the Minister of State is aware already of my views on this matter.  It is one that we are pursuing and that I will continue to debate at every opportunity.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 13 relates to the right to repair.  This amendment would insert the words \"and availability\" into the provision that targets within the circular economy should result in increased levels of repair and reuse of products and materials.  It is a relatively simple amendment but it helps with the issue of just transition.  This is around decent community-based work.  A target to increase the availability of repair would mean that the strategy had targets around job creation and regional access to repairs.  Repair is an area of opportunity, in terms of employment and, indeed, in terms of persons addressing issues of cost of living.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 14 seeks to ensure that sectoral arrangements that may be made under this Act are not voluntary but, in fact, mandatory.  That is probably one of the most important amendments of all.  Having a long statement about all of the circular economy strategy and all of these matters, the idea of having \"on a voluntary basis\" attached to all of that for every sector - leaving aside the levies on consumption but in terms of the list of big sectors identified such as retail, manufacture and business - and that one would only have any action being taken on a voluntary basis begs the question, \"What is the point of the Bill?\"  Is it just a Bill about cups and single-use items or is it a Bill about the circular economy?  If it is a Bill about the circular economy, one does not talk at length about some strategy and then say that one hopes people will do it.  If that is the case, we all may as well draw up codes and award prizes for good companies.  Legislation is for legislating and putting regulations and measures in place.  This is the opportunity to put hard, real measures in place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That participation by those crucial sectors, with their incredibly important implications, in the kinds of strategies we are setting out and for which we are going to all this trouble to resource and develop is voluntary is kind of a wasted opportunity.  It guts the Bill, really.  I am not simply talking about punitive regulatory measures.  I have spoken about the fact that I believe we need to have positive measures, for example, public procurement policies that reward companies that engage in best practice.  I am referring to positive measures that support and identify industrial practices of the kind in question.  There are many stronger positive steps we could and should be taking.  Also, we need to have some regulation.  We need to be tackling these measures in a stronger way.<\/p><p>For me, amendments Nos. 14 to 17 all address the same areas: retail, packaging, textiles and, crucially, electronic equipment.  Think of the fact that so much electronic equipment contains precious metals.  We should look to some of the concrete measures introduced in other countries, for example, real rules concerning how a floor is divided, packaging and how much floor space in a supermarket is given to certain kinds of products.  These are the hard tools, yet we are not using this opportunity to empower the Minister to set out, as in amendments Nos. 16 and 17, mandatory requirements and regulations for the sectors to ensure they meet their sectoral targets.<\/p><p>The fact is companies need us to regulate them.  Good companies want regulation.  They want to be rewarded in terms of procurement and see it recognised.  Each individual company answers to its shareholders or owners and companies have fiduciary and financial duties.  To ask companies to take on these measures voluntarily, with the potential cost that may come with that, creates tension.  Most companies will meet their fiduciary duties while ensuring they comply with the laws.  Therefore, when we put good laws in place, we empower companies, executives and staff to take good measures.  Otherwise, we are simply relying on consumer pressure.  Again, the Government is passing the buck down the line to the customer and saying the customer has to try to influence the companies, including companies associated with retail, packaging, textiles and electronic equipment that are of a scale where it is very difficult to achieve the kind of change desired.  The State, at the stroke of a pen, could introduce changes in terms of manufacturing and business practices if it chose to put in place mandatory requirements and regulations.<\/p><p>These amendments are fundamental.  Amendments Nos. 15 to 18, inclusive, all relate to these areas.  I have lengthy examples of the kinds of regulations we should be introducing in terms of retail, packaging, textiles and electronic equipment but I am going to leave them aside because time is limited.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 18 provides that mandatory requirements may be set out for the retail sector&rsquo;s targets and the display or promotion of goods.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 19 proposes to insert a requirement that the circular economy strategy would set out actions necessary to further just transition and climate justice in the context of the development of a circular economy.  I will not reiterate all my points on those matters.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 28 seeks to insert the provision that the circular economy programme would reflect the principles of just transition and climate justice.  I have discussed these matters extensively, so I will not expand on them further at this point.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 30 is a relatively simple one that changes the timeframe in which the agency may review the circular economy from at least once every six years after the publication of the first strategy to once every three years.  Once every six years is too long a timeframe.  We need to be identifying problems and issues with the operation of the programme as quickly as possible.  In fact, if we look to our carbon budgets, which operate according to five-year cycles, we should ensure we are being informed of what is and is not working regarding a circular economy strategy and that this knowledge influences new measures that might be put in place or new decisions on the next budget.  We are talking about five-year units in terms of our carbon budgets, and we should not be having six-year units regarding the circular economy strategies.  It just does not make sense.<\/p><p>I have further information on the urgency and the fact that every single year matters, but maybe the simplest fact I would take from a lengthy section on urgency, which I am not going to read out, is that the past ten years have been the hottest ten on record in 100,000.  The next ten years really matter.  Everything we do in every year matters.  Regarding six-year strategies, I do not even think about the 2050 targets anymore.  Rather, I think about the 2030 targets, because if we do not turn things around by 2026, we will be in extraordinary trouble.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 31 is a simple amendment that seeks to insert a requirement that the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action be one of the bodies to which the agency must give a copy of the circular economy strategy, once published.  Perhaps the Minister of State can do even better than that.  Given the expertise across the House and all parties and the genuine passion of all members of the committee, which has been evident from their presence throughout these debates, it is important the committee be consulted on the circular economy strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#WW02300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I will not be accepting these amendments.

For that reason, the current text is appropriate and proportionate to achieve the policy objectives set out in regard to the strategy.

It is a long-term programme with long-term actions and objectives that will see real and meaningful change.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 30 seeks to shorten the term of the programme to three years.  I do not believe this is appropriate.  The nature of this programme requires that the actions be given sufficient time to be effective and achieve real results.  Three years is not enough time in that context.  It runs the risk that excessive resources would get caught up in an ongoing cycle of drafting new programmes at the expense of making progress on the objectives of the programme itself.  Therefore, I do not accept amendment No. 30.<\/p> <p>On amendment No. 28, the circular economy programme gives effect to the objectives of the circular economy strategy.

Through our legislation, we take decisions which have implications in that regard.<\/p><p>I am concerned by the fact that the Minister fears legal challenge over regulating sectors.  We regulate things all the time.  How on earth would concern around a legal challenge affect the State's setting out measures to regulate sectors?  To be clear, we are not going to achieve the action on climate change we need or face up to the existential threat it poses by simply changing consumer procedures alone.  There is an idea that the State can only work through consumer power.  The State must become ready and willing to challenge some sector of the economy and some set of businesses about something.  We must challenge areas such as textiles and electronics.  If we are not willing to say \"Boo\" to somebody in manufacturing, we are not going to take the action we need.  There seems to be an idea that we are afraid to regulate.  It may be that the Government has chosen not to regulate in this legislation.  The Minister of State said he is concerned about legal challenge.  My measures here require mandatory requirements and regulations around the display or promotion of goods.  The Government's position is inconsistent.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act included measures around the display and promotion of alcoholic goods.  That is totally legal.  It was fine and is now the law.  As a result, actions have been changed.  It is hard law and not a voluntary code, which means the way in which alcohol is displayed in supermarkets has changed.  That is what the Government does.  It brings forward actual laws and measures that require good practice.<\/p><p>Similarly, amendment No. 16 calls for mandatory requirements and regulations on sectoral targets in areas such as retail, packaging and textiles.  To be clear, commercial activity and economic activity take place within the State when they take place within the State.  Society is not sitting inside the economy; the economy is sitting inside society.  We are elected by the citizens to regulate in that regard and to set those rules.  I encourage the Minister of State to consider, question and challenge the kind of line that is coming through because, frankly, if we start hearing that line any time we try to regulate a sector, we are in trouble.<\/p><p>I have included other measures relating to public public partnerships and so on.

Anything that is responding to climate change is effectively emergency legislation, in that it is taking place within a very narrow emergency time period.  We did not have such long periods of review in respect of our Covid-19 legislation because it was dealing with an emergency situation and we should not have such long periods of review in respect of our climate legislation.  We need to be getting it right.  We need to think not only about the longer term.  We require shorter timeframes and more urgent action.  These actions need to be treated as urgent in response to a crisis.

The first thing to say is that the regulation of aviation and shipping is very important from the point of view of equity.  People will not want to comply with climate action requirements if they think that shipping and aviation are getting a free ride.  Traditionally and for a long time the fuels used for aviation and shipping have been virtually free of tax because if a tax is imposed in one country, those providers will refill in another.  The way to sort out that problem is through international co-operation so it must be done at EU level rather than in a unilateral, national way.  It is being done at EU level.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I are negotiating with the EU Council to ensure these sectors are included in the emissions trading system, that their fuels are replaced with sustainable fuels and that they are taxed according to the same types of taxes that apply if one is driving a vehicle within a member state.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned the ability of the Bill to impose binding targets and my fear that I could open up legal challenge to the Bill.  The Bill does not provide necessary principles and policies to impose legally binding targets by way of secondary legislation.

The problem is that the Senator's proposals would give me, as Minister, almost unlimited power to impose restrictions on economic activity all the way across society.  As the Senator knows, there are legal limits to the types of executive powers that can be allowed for a Minister through legislation unless the necessary principles can be demonstrated within the

Amendment No. 59 adds a definition that clarifies amendments Nos. 53 and 54.<\/p><p>The European Environmental Agency, EEA, states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... absolute obsolescence happens when a product no longer functions for objective reasons, because of a mechanical failure (mechanical obsolescence) or incompatibility of software (incompatibility obsolescence).  Relative obsolescence means that the product is still functional, but is considered obsolete because of a desire for a new item (psychological, style, cosmetic or aesthetic obsolescence); a new product has better quality, functionality or effectiveness (technological obsolescence); or the price of repair or upgrade is too high compared with a new product (economic obsolescence). <\/blockquote> <p>According to a paper by the European Parliamentary Research Service, the main driver for the purchase of some products, such as washing machines, is absolute obsolescence whereas relative obsolescence is more important in the purchase of mobile phones or televisions.  The EEA states that &quot;a product becomes prematurely obsolescent when it breaks down early compared with what is possible&quot;.  This again involves a choice being made to design a product in such a way that some element of it will break down and stop the product from functioning compared with the desired lifetime, which is what is desirable for the individual who purchased it.  This is often the case with mechanical and electronic items.  When the two forms of obsolescence are combined, it is known as planned obsolescence.<\/p><p>Following pre-legislative scrutiny, the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action recommended that an examination be conducted into the potential measures to address the challenge of planned obsolescence, particularly for electronics which are such a significant area.  This could include a broad examination of international examples and potential measures.  These could include the concept of the right to repair, which we have spoken about to some extent, as well as measures to tackle this important issue at the manufacturing point.  If the product can be repaired, it should not be designed in a way that it only addresses one of those issues, namely, where the price of repair or upgrade becomes too high - economic obsolescence.  Other areas such as mechanical obsolescence and bad design also need to be addressed.  The joint committee highlighted that both France and Italy have produced legislation taking different approaches to address the issue of planned obsolescence.  Although that legislation has been challenged, it is working.  We are beginning to see early case law with prosecutions being taken on planned obsolescence in France and Italy.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 55 and 57 relate to the fundamental issue of resource management.  It is no longer about waste but about resource management and the best possible management of finite resources.  We talk about our carbon emissions space as being finite and a planetary boundary.  Another part of our planetary boundary is the finite minerals, especially given the emission price of accessing those minerals.  These amendments seek to add to the list of items, the supply of which the Minister may, by regulation, prohibit in the State, products that require precious metals or rare earth minerals to be completed.  I am dealing with a blunt tool because I am dealing with the space of prohibition.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course, I would prefer it if we had guidelines and regulations on manufacture and usage.  The committee was clear on this matter, recommending \"that given the importance of management of minerals, including precious minerals, in the context of national and global circular economy strategies, regulation and, where necessary, limitations in respect of the extraction of such minerals should be considered\".  I would also suggest that prohibitions should be considered.<\/p><p>I have spoken about extraction in the context of climate justice, but in the context of this amendment it is worth noting that, every year, at least $10 billion worth of gold, platinum and other precious materials are dumped into a growing mountain of electronic waste, which pollutes our environment.  According to the UN Global E-waste Monitor 2020, a record 54 million tonnes of e-waste was generated worldwide in 2019.  We are increasing wastage of these previous metals and minerals.  This is equivalent to 7.3 kg for every person on the planet in 2019 alone but the majority of this is generated in the global north.  We often boast about being early adopters but some of this early adoption and quickly moving fashions represent an irresponsible use of resources.  The lack of regulation, the short lifespans of products and products being difficult or impossible to repair were issues identified by the UN as driving much of this wastage.<\/p><p>These amendments would allow us to begin seriously to reduce the damage being done by the extraction of precious metals and minerals, which is deeply linked to the issue of climate justice, and to try to curb what are very much neocolonial aspects of the production of electronic goods and the extraction and exploitation required in the making of these products.  We need only look to the very serious human rights concerns in respect of the extraction of coltan in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other countries to see an example of this.  We need to minimise such extraction.  We have used centuries' and millennia's worth of resources in the previous century alone.  We need to pause extraction and look to the maximum effective use of all precious minerals currently in circulation globally before we consider extending or increasing further extraction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#ZZ06600","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":532,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  All those of us on the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action accept and are wedded to the idea of moving to a circular economy and away from a linear one.  Part of the way to do that is to buy less stuff.  It is one of the most obvious ways for people to reduce their own waste.  My amendment No. 64 deals with a problem that has emerged whereby not buying stuff is generating waste.  This is because many corporations have a business model involving overproduction.  They also want to shift assets quickly so, the longer the stock remains unsold, the more it becomes a liability and a cost on the corporations' books.  The storage of this stock incurs such a cost that it becomes cheaper to dispose of the goods than to continue to store them.<\/p> <p>We also see the business models of luxury brands, which prefer to destroy unsold merchandise as they do not wish to sacrifice an image of scarcity and exclusivity.  The designer brand company Burberry burnt &euro;38 million worth of stock in a single year rather than redistributing it, just to preserve that image of exclusivity.  It is not just Burberry; it is Amazon, H&amp;M, Nike and so on.  Producers and retailers are sending millions of tonnes of products that have never been opened directly to landfill or incinerators.  These are completely brand new materials.  This all occurs out of the sight of the public.  We are always talking about the importance of systemic change and not putting everything on the individual.  It is thanks to the investigative reports in Germany that the public got a window into this practice.  It was first exposed in 2018 at a so-called fulfilment centre of Amazon's and then again in Britain in 2021.  We all must agree that this is an immoral practice.  Brand new products, because they are unsold, are going straight from the shelves to landfill.<\/p> <p>One spreadsheet in the British example showed that 124,000 items were marked for destruction in a single week.  Amazon likes to tell us that it makes best efforts to redistribute such products and to find homes for them with charities but the spreadsheet told a different story.  It showed 124,000 brand new items marked for destruction while only 28,000 were marked for redistribution.  These items included smart televisions, laptops, iPads, leisure equipment, electrical items, Dyson fans, hairdryers and Bluetooth earphones.  What was particularly galling about the case in England was that these laptops and iPads were being sent straight to landfill during the pandemic, when children in low-income households were being denied access to education because they did not have the technological facilities required.  Households were really struggling while these multinational corporations were just binning items they could have used.  Most reasonable people would be horrified by that practice.  It is not just that the carbon footprint of these items is large but also, as Senator Higgins has outlined, that many rely on finite resources for their production.<\/p> <p>The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action carried out lengthy pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill.  Everybody was very positive about it and tried to contribute to it.  In pre-legislative scrutiny, we often ask the experts who is doing a given thing well and what jurisdictions we can learn from.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel so we ask which jurisdictions have got it right.  When it comes to the circular economy, there was no argument.  Everybody pointed to France.  Later amendments of mine will talk about what France has done in respect of food waste and refill stations in supermarkets.  It has also banned the practice I have been talking about, so we cannot hide behind EU law and say it cannot be done.  The French Government passed a law in January 2020 that basically says these multinational corporations cannot just dispose of unused items and items returned that are still in their boxes, and that they have to redistribute them.  They have to identify organisations or charities to receive the items.<\/p> <p>Because we all know the circular economy issue is very significant and because we are trying to move away from a philosophy of take, use and waste, it is disappointing that much of the focus has been on the latte levy.  That is not the fault of the Minister of State or of the joint committee.  The media have fed into it.  The latte levy is tinkering around the edges, although that is not to say it should not be done.  It again puts the onus back on the individual and says it is up to the individual to bring along his or her KeepCup.  What I am trying to do with amendment No. 64 is to put the onus back on the corporations because the public is largely unaware of this practice.  The French have shown great ambition in this legislation.  It was only introduced in 2020.  It will come into effect in 2023.  I urge the Minister of State to give it serious consideration because it represents real and radical action on reducing waste as opposed to the measures on plastic cups and paper cups we have spent so much time talking about.  This is about televisions, laptops and other electronic goods going straight to landfill or incineration.  It is the same with clothes, shoes and many other things many people could really do with during a cost-of-living crisis.  I look forward to hearing whether the Minister of State will accept this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#AAA00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>As Senator Boylan has said, in the committee we discussed obsolescence and other issues around large items, electronic devices and white goods.  The recommendation was for the Minister of State and the Department to investigate the matter.  I will be keen to hear what investigation was done in that regard.  I remember looking around IKEA, a large store, several years ago and there were standard lamps for sale in which the light bulb could not be changed.  If it went, you had to get a whole new lamp.  That is built-in obsolescence in action.  It needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>I completely agree that the so-called latte levy has overshadowed a lot of the very good work in the Bill.  It is difficult because that is what people go for in the discussion in the media.  However, we all agree on the need to reduce the use of stuff.

I know the Minister of State said the last time we discussed this that one thing that can be done at a local level and that he is looking at is a labelling system that would inform the public as to whether something has built-in obsolescence.  I will let the Minister of State come in on that.  It is an issue I feel passionate about.

I am shocked that 130,000 electrical items can be brought straight to dumps in one week.  It is absolutely shocking.  I have to be direct with the Minister of State, though I will be respectful.  I cannot for the life of me understand why he would not support an amendment like this, something that will make a fundamental difference in a really significant way, particularly when we have the French example and we know it can be done.  I imagine everyone would say this should be done.  I am sure the Minister of State will not argue we should not tackle this issue, but I am afraid he will suggest we not tackle it today.  Will we have another circular economy Bill next year?  This is the opportunity to do this.  As Senator Boylan pointed out, this was brought up on Committee Stage.  I understand the Minister of State said he would go away and investigate this.  There is a fundamental point here as to how we change our economy.  When goods go to landfill without ever being used, not only do we waste the product and all the energy and raw materials that went into making it, but we also facilitate large corporations' unsustainable business model of greedy overconsumption.  How on earth can the Minister of State not endorse this amendment?  It is so fundamental, so crucial, to the type of change I believe we all want to see.  I hope the Minister of State will not turn down the amendment; I hope he will endorse it.  We have an amendment, so there is no reason he cannot endorse it today and move on in a positive way.  Will a Green Party Minister of State reject this amendment when something so absolutely egregious is going on weekly, with 130,000 electric goods being sent straight to landfill?  Is the Bill really going to turn a blind eye to that and to the appalling practices of companies like Amazon?  Seriously?  I hope the Minister of State will come back with a positive endorsement of this amendment; otherwise, let us be clear, the Green Party will not just miss a huge opportunity to do the right thing but will also let down a great many of its own supporters who, I believe, would be fully supportive of the amendment.  There will not be a second chance on this in the lifetime of this Government.  This is the chance to endorse something that would make a fundamental difference in the right way to our economy and our society.  I ask the Minister of State to support amendment No. 64.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#BBB00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions.<\/p> <p>I agree with the objective of amendment No. 64 and, in general terms, the way in which it attempts to address the problem of new consumer goods being disposed of by either merchants or Internet vendors.  Reference was made to the French law, which is given careful consideration.  It is important when writing legislation to look at other jurisdictions to see what has worked and what works within the framework of European law.  The French law is scheduled to come into effect in 2023.  I expect that the European legislation on which we are working will be in effect before then, leaving the French law moot.<\/p> <p>Coming back to this amendment, one of the central components of a circular economy is enhanced reparability and ease of maintenance of consumer goods.  In order to achieve a successful transition to a circular economy, we must recognise that and commit to the development of a circular economy for consumer goods with an enhanced focus on the repair sector.  That is a clear objective of the waste action plan for a circular economy and the circular economy strategy.  I think the meaningful and significant changes required as regards issues such as product design, warrantees and consumer information and labelling can be most effectively implemented by way of comprehensive EU legislation rather than through piecemeal national measures.  This is even more important for member states like Ireland which represent relatively small markets relative to those of the rest of the EU.  We must always remember that our laws have national application and will not apply to a warehouse in Luxembourg, Scotland or wherever else this kind of dumping may be happening.<\/p> <p>As we discussed last week, the process of introducing that EU legislation has already commenced.  The European Commission has already announced a proposal for a regulation on eco-design for sustainable products as well as a proposal for a directive to empower consumers for the green transition through better protection against unfair practices and better information.  The proposed eco-design regulation will address product design and set new requirements to make products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle, and energy- and resource-efficient.  The regulation provides a framework to improve the environmental sustainability of products and refers specifically, in Article 1 and Article 20, to the creation of an EU framework to prevent unsold consumer products from being destroyed, so that very concept is being talked about throughout Europe.  The proposed directive on consumer information will support improved participation of consumers in the circular economy through the provision of information on the durability and reparability of products and by enhancing consumer protection against unfair commercial practices that prevent sustainable purchases.  It will therefore tackle issues such as greenwashing, that is, misleading environmental claims, and should tackle early obsolescence practices, that is, premature failure of goods, and the use of unreliable and non-transparent sustainability labels and information tools.  The approach in these proposals reflects the approach we have already taken in the circular economy strategy, and Ireland will adopt an ambitious and supportive stance in the forthcoming EU negotiations with a view to making sure the final legislation maximises support for the transition to a circular economy.  I understand that the first meeting in respect of these new proposals has taken place already and that a further meeting will be scheduled for later this week.  I believe that seeking to achieve these objectives by means of EU legislation, rather than in national legislation, will ensure better and more consistent protection for consumers and will most effectively meet the ultimate aims of this amendment.  I will therefore not accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>Moving to amendments Nos. 53 to 59, inclusive, I said earlier that I believe that meaningful changes to requirements in respect of issues of obsolescence and repair can be most effectively implemented by way of comprehensive EU legislation rather than through piecemeal national measures.  I will not accept these amendments.<\/p> <p>As for amendment No. 57 specifically, I have not changed my position on this issue and will not accept the amendment as I consider it unnecessary.  Transnational shipments of waste, including to non-EU countries, are already highly regulated under EU legislation and the Bill provides that material wastage associated with a product or class of products must be considered when making regulations.  I am satisfied that the combination of those measures adequately addresses the issues referred to in the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#BBB00300","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I would never profess to have anywhere near the same level of expertise and knowledge as my colleague, Senator Boylan, or Senator Higgins on this, but I do understand the politics of it and the climate, biodiversity and environmental emergency we face.

In the Horn of Africa, large parts of Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, the situation is now worse than the 2011 famine that killed more than 250,000 people.  Some 23 million people are in need of humanitarian support and food across the region.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 65 touches on the issue of fast fashion.  For many people clothing that is not produced using sustainable methods is their only option because it is inexpensive.  However, we also know that the industry itself is a big polluter and in terms of climate justice it has an extremely negative impact on indigenous fashion industries in the global south countries.<br\/><br\/>Award winning journalist Sally Hayden has highlighted that in Ghana second-hand garments that arrive from Europe and North Africa are known as <i>obroni wawu<\/i>, dead white men's clothes.  Some 50 million of them find their way to Accra, the west African country's capital.  Much of what arrives is clearly waste meaning that the African continent is often left to deal with the devastating impact of overconsumption and the rise in fast fashion.  I regret that my previous amendments seeking to ensure that clothes that have a lifespan of less than two years should not be sold was ruled out of order because I do not believe that clothes with a lifespan of less than two years should be sold.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 66 seeks a report, within 12 months of the passing of this legislation, outlining the mechanisms employed to ensure that both the circular economy strategy and the circular economy programme protect human rights and the environment along the supply chain of goods.  EU legislation in the area of due diligence needs to be strengthened as it currently only covers about 1% of companies.  This is consistent with that general principle.  The Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights report Make It Your Business! has clearly outlined the need for far higher accountability mechanisms in the supply chains of Irish companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#CCC03000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I will speak to amendments Nos. 62 and 63.  I will be very brief because I understand we have many amendments to get through.  Amendment No. 62 deals with the definition of food waste as meaning food loss and food waste.  We discussed this on Committee Stage.  We are very concerned that food loss is not being captured by the circular economy Bill because it is not defined.  Most people are aware that 30% of food that is purchased is disposed of.  Food loss is the food that never makes it to the shop shelf.  That includes food which is left in the ground because the farmer deems it more financially viable to leave it there than to harvest it.  It also deals with food that gets disturbed or spoiled along the way.  It is really important to capture food loss because if we are only capturing food waste, we are missing a large proportion of the actual food waste that is going on.  I would like the Minister of State to outline why he would not accept the amendment on Committee Stage.  I hope he has changed his mind now.  We need to capture the whole picture.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 63 again deals with the French example of the supermarket refill stations putting the onus on the corporations and not on the individuals.  We know that many goods lend themselves to refill packaging rather than the single-use packaging, including dry foods, detergents and cosmetics.  The French law obliges any supermarket larger than 400 sq. m to dedicate 20% of its space to refill.  This has been in action in France for years and is working really well.  Anybody who travels to France can see it.  People bring Tupperware containers to the supermarket and refill them with beans, rice, flour or whatever.<\/p> <p>I disagree with the Minister of State's rationale for not accepting amendment No. 64.  I spent five years in Europe.  It drives me mad that when we want to do something positive, we are often told that EU law precludes us from doing it and it is used as an excuse for not taking action.  Here we have an example that is proven.  The French are doing it so it is not contrary to EU law.  However, we are being told that we should just hang on and wait for the EU to do it.  That is really disappointing and lacking in ambition.  We need to lead.  We need to look to what has been done successfully in France.  The French banned the disposal of food items years ago.<\/p> <p>I was in the European Parliament for the negotiations of the single-use plastics directive.  Even though that was one of the fastest directives to get passed, it still took almost a year.  The Minister of State said we are talking about addressing the issue of dumping unused non-food products.  The Government introduced two non-consequential amendments to this Bill because Ireland was so slow in enacting a 2019 derogation.  Even if the EU were to take this on board and move from talking about it to enacting it, it would still take a couple of years.  That is the reality of how EU legislation works.  When EU legislation is passed, Ireland has a particularly bad record of transposing that legislation and so it could take another three years, as happened with the non-consequential electricity amendment the Government made to this Bill on Committee Stage.  The letter from the Commission came in 2019 informing us that we needed to act on it and we have now fast-tracked it through.<\/p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to reconsider his approach to amendment No. 64 and seize the opportunity.  He is the Minister of State.  Everybody says that one day in government is better than years in opposition.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to show the leadership and take a radical step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#DDD00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#DDD00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I do not accept amendments Nos. 60 to 62, inclusive.  On amendment No. 62, the development of a national food waste prevention roadmap is included as a commitment in Ireland&rsquo;s waste action plan for a circular economy and the Government&rsquo;s 2021 climate action plan.  While the national food waste prevention roadmap will include information on food losses, the principal focus of the roadmap will be to set out a series of actions to deliver the reductions necessary to halve our food waste by 2030.  This takes into account sustainable development goal 12.3 of the United Nations sustainable development goals and the plan by the European Commission to propose legally binding targets to reduce food waste across the EU by end 2023.<\/p> <p>The definition of &ldquo;food waste&rdquo; in the Bill is consistent with the definition set out in EU legislation.  National Food waste data, which is subject to EU reporting requirements, is also consistent with this definition.  Food waste data reported from member states in mid-2022 for the reference year 2020 will also inform the process at EU level on setting targets to reduce food waste across the EU.  This EU definition of food waste is more comprehensive than the equivalent term as used by the UN.  The EU definition treats as food waste all food discarded as waste throughout the supply chain up to and including actions by consumers.  In an EU context, the concept of food loss is used to describe loss of food in primary production, for example, pre-harvest losses, which is excluded from the scope of waste framework directive.  The current definition of \"food waste\" in the Bill is appropriate and already addresses the activities covered by amendment A.<\/p> <p>I will not be accepting amendment No. 60 because it is consequential on amendment No. 3, which I have not accepted.<\/p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 61, United Nations sustainable development goals are defined in the Bill as meaning the United Nations sustainable development goals 1 to 17, inclusive  The goals and their associated sub-targets are interlinked and mutually supporting and need to be considered in that context.  As a result, I will not be accepting these amendments.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 63, 65 and 66 provide for a number of reports to be prepared by the Minister.  I cannot accept amendment No. 65.  Policy on textiles is currently being developed, with a multi-stakeholder working group having been formed by my Department to inform that process.  Legislative amendments may be appropriate in the future but not at this time.<\/p> <p>The report sought in amendment No. 66 duplicates measures included in the Bill on the preparation of the circular economy strategy and programme.  In addition, the State is required to comply with EU law as a matter of course.  Therefore, I am not accepting this amendment.<\/p> <p>What is proposed in amendment No. 63 is overly prescriptive for inclusion in primary legislation.  As a result, I will not be accepting the amendment.  However, reducing food packaging in way which does not lead to increased food waste is an important issue and I will commit to the publication of such report before the end of 2023 on a non-statutory basis.  I do not believe it is necessary for me to put into law that I will produce a report, but I give the House a commitment that I will produce such a report.  Of course, it will look at the EU example.<\/p> <p>One Senator said that this had been working in France for years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The climate and resilience law was passed in France last year but the section about designating that 20% of certain areas of supermarkets over a certain size would be used for refillable goods only comes into force in 2030.

For instance, they brought in some forms of plastic packaging bans in January.  We will be watching to see what the effect of those packaging bans is on food waste and whether that plastic packaging is replaced with other forms of packaging, which may also be single use and not sustainable.

There is some potential repetition in terms of the two different Acts the amendments seek to amend.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 68 and 90 seek the outright deletion of sections 20 and 32 of the Bill.  Sections 20 and 32 make provisions for operational CCTV for certain purposes.  It is our assertion that these sections of the Bill are unnecessary and provide opportunity for problematic scope creep in the future.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 82 and 104 seek the outright deletion of sections 22, 23, 33 and 34 of the Bill.  Sections 22 and 23 make provisions for the codes of practice around local authorities' CCTV schemes.  Section 23 and 34 relate to the admissibility of data collected through the CCTV schemes as evidence in criminal trials.  Again, it is our assertion that these sections of the Bill are unnecessary and provide opportunity for problematic scope creep in the future.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 69 and 92 adjust the purposes for which an authorised person may submit a proposal for the installation of the operation of a CCTV scheme in a functional area.  Currently, the Bill provides that an authorised person may submit a proposal for a scheme for the purpose of deterrence, prevention, detection and prosecution of offences under the specified Act.  This amendment seeks to delete the first three of these purposes and retain only the prosecution of an offence as a purpose for which a CCTV scheme can be proposed.<\/p> <p>There is a significant difference, in my mind, in using surveillance in certain circumstances where one knows a crime has been committed in the hopes of identifying a person or persons who committed an offence, versus using surveillance to try to identify crimes being committed in a functional area.  I believe it is wholly inappropriate that we should provide scoping legislation for local authorities to surveil people constantly in their functional areas.  This, essentially, is what has been provided for by this part of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The use of CCTV has serious implications for the right to privacy.  In order to ensure that the interference with privacy is proportionate, the effectiveness of CCTV in fighting crime must be demonstrated.  Given that this legislation is likely to result in the expansion of surveillance technology in our public spaces, it is important that we would hear more about the necessity and proportionality of schemes being provided for in this Bill.  How effective is CCTV surveillance in preventing and detecting crime?  Has research been undertaken in this respect in an Irish context or has any international research in this area been consulted in the drafting of this legislation?  According to bodies such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of CCTV in preventing crime in Ireland and in other contexts, with research yielding mixed results.  Very simply, there must be evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of CCTV schemes before we agree to expand them further.  To date, this has not been provided.  I would welcome any clarification that the Minister of State could provide in this regard.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 70, 71, 93 and 94 are related.  Currently, the relevant subsection sets out that details of location, number and technical specification of the devices being used must be provided by the authorised officer when submitting a proposal for a scheme.  The amendment breaks the relevant subsection down into two separate subsections.  One subsection focuses on the details of the location and number of CCTV devices within the proposed scheme, and the other subsection focuses on the technical specifications of the devices within the proposed scheme.  We propose two subsections because we feel that the provision regarding the technical specification of the devices requires elaboration.  Amendments Nos. 70 and 93, therefore, set out the details that ought to be provided about the location and the number of devices to be used in a scheme.  In addition to the wording as drafted, we have included the word \"precisely\" with regard to the location of the devices to ensure that specific details are provided as opposed to a general area or locality.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 71 and 94 separately set out the details that ought to be provided in a proposed CCTV scheme in relation to its technical specifications.  Again, we have added to the Government's drafting with an amendment attempting to bring clarity as to what would be required in the technical specification.  The amendment provides that detailed information regarding the hardware, software and AI used in the recording, processing and storage of data must be provided when proposing a scheme.  Not all CCTV cameras work in the same way and not all software that is used to process or analyse recorded visual data does this in the same way.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 72 and 95 seek to add an additional requirement that must be met when an unauthorised person submits a proposal for a CCTV scheme.  This is information regarding the deletion and destruction of data that is produced pursuant to the scheme.  As drafted, an authorised officer must only set out details of the arrangements regarding the preservation of the data produced pursuant to the proposed scheme.  While there is reference to codes of practice in a later section of the Bill to the deletion, disposal and destruction of data, we feel that it should be incumbent on the authorised officer to provide details of the proposals in this regard when setting out the details of the CCTV scheme.  When a chief executive is deciding on whether or not to grant permission for a CCTV scheme it is critical that he or she has information available about the proposals for the deletion and destruction of the data.  This is especially pertinent if earlier amendments restricting the purpose of the scheme are not accepted.  If a CCTV scheme is constantly surveilling a local area a large swathe of personal data will be collected every single day.  In our view, it is not acceptable that a proposal for a scheme would not include the details for the deletion or destruction of the data, when this is what will be required in the majority of cases.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 73 and 96 introduce new provisions which specify an assessment of the ethical, environmental and class considerations that must be carried out as part of any CCTV scheme proposal.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The aim of the amendment is to ensure any scheme that is proposed is fair and ethical and not harmful to the local environment insofar as possible.  Particular areas and communities are surveilled more frequently and intensely than others and the amendment aims to prevent this.  In addition, it seeks that any proposed scheme includes an ethical and environmental consideration.  I want to elaborate on the amendment, which is quite important to me.  I listen to conversations on CCTV in certain locations and sometimes there is an increase in antisocial behaviour in a particular community or scaremongering about the sale of drugs in a particular area.  My biggest concern is that we might end up with communities that are already overpoliced getting CCTV installed and picking up a huge amount of people's everyday lives on the suspicion that they are engaged in some sort of behaviour.  That can lead to a class analysis of CCTV, where it is placed, why it is placed and what type of data is being created.  That is my real fear and what I am trying to address in this amendment.  People will say that is not the intention of the CCTV but I will give a separate example.  During Covid when there was the 5 km travel rule, the Garda placed its checkpoints and gave out fines predominantly in working-class areas.  At some level people make decisions based on class analysis and that happens with policing.  The fear is we will have that creep in with CCTV.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 74 and 97 seek to ensure that the chief executive of a relevant local authority consults with relevant persons when deciding whether to grant permission for a CCTV scheme.  As the Bill is drafted, a chief executive has unilateral power to grant or refuse permission for a scheme.  Given the far-reaching impacts of a prospective CCTV scheme on individuals and communities within a functional area, it does not seem right that a chief executive should wield so much unilateral power.  The amendments, as drafted, specify the persons the chief executive should consult with but it could include: other members of the local authority executive, local councillors, people living and working in the local authority area or persons with expertise in human rights, equality or data protection.  If there are conversations about using any sort of technology or software, it is not wise to have a chief executive who probably does not have any understanding of how any sort of artificial intelligence is built or of facial recognition making a decision on whether to put CCTV in a particular place without understanding the technology.  The chief executive should have to be informed by people who understand the software we are using and the human rights and data impacts of such a CCTV scheme.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 75 and 98 aim to establish a publicly accessible database within each local authority which sets out the precise location of recording devices in the local authority area.  This is a hugely important amendment for ensuring the transparency and ethics of any proposed scheme.  All recording devices should be prominently marked so that their presence and purpose are unmistakable in any event.  The amendment also suggests that a database &quot;which is accessible to the public&quot; should exist.  Sections 57, 89 and 90 of the Data Protection Act 2018 require that data subjects be informed of: the controllers; how to contact the controllers; the purpose of the process; the legal basis of processing; the recipients of data; whether data will be transferred to a third party, and if so, what safeguards apply; duration of storage; what data rights apply to the data where automated decision-making is applied; and, if so, what the logic is.  It is not immediately clear how this occurs in practice as it relates to the recording devices specified in the Bill.  I would welcome clarification from the Minister of State in this regard.  According to the Data Protection Commission:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe use of recording mechanisms to obtain data without an individual's knowledge is generally unlawful.  Covert surveillance is normally only permitted on an exceptional case-by-case basis ... [and] must be focused and of short duration. <\/blockquote><p>The commission goes on to state: &quot;If the surveillance is intended to prevent crime, overt cameras may be considered to be a more appropriate measure, and less invasive of individual privacy.&quot;<br\/><br\/>From my reading of the Bill it is unclear whether the proposed surveillance is to be overt or covert.  If covert surveillance is provided for, there is a dearth of information on the additional safeguards required to ensure compliance with UN rights and data protection concerns.  Providing a publicly available database of all recording devices within the local authority would be one such safeguard.<br\/><br\/>When considering this amendment and the drafting of same, the following point was a bit of an afterthought and the deadline had passed for submitting amendments but I was also thinking that people need to be made aware of where cameras are, what the specification is and that they need to be clearly signposted.  Down the line we should also look at the following idea: in local communities when planning permission is being sought or if building is happening, if we put up a sign to say it is intended to build on this site, people should have an opportunity to make objections to building.  When it comes to technology and surveillance we should also consider that planning-type objection model where the community can submit objections to technology being installed in their local areas and facing onto their parks and playgrounds where people are living their everyday lives.  I did not get to include that in these amendments but that point is worth thinking about.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 76 and 99 seek to ensure that the chief executive of a relevant local authority consults with &quot;relevant persons&quot; when deciding whether or not to renew or revoke a permission for a CCTV scheme at the conclusion of a review.  As the Bill is drafted, the chief executive has unilateral power to grant a renewal or revoke permission.  These amendments, like amendment No. 81, provides an important check and balance in respect of a chief executive's powers.  It seems especially important that a chief executive would consult with relevant persons when reviewing an expired or soon to be expired permission, given that the review will determine the effectiveness, necessity, proportionality or otherwise of a particular scheme in practice, as opposed to in theory.  Like No. 81, the amendment as drafted has not specified the persons the chief executive should consult with but it could include: other members of the local authority; the executive; local councillors; people living and working in the local authority area; or persons with expertise in human rights, equality and data protection.  It is particularly important that we do not just keep granting CCTV permissions in an area where it is not required and where there has been no assessment on whether it was effective in any shape or form.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 77 and 100 are on proposed changes to an approved scheme.  As drafted, the Bill permits repairs or modifications of an already approved scheme that do not alter the extent of the coverage of the scheme or the capability of the devices used in the scheme without a proposal being made.  These amendments seek to amend the provisions that only repairs can be made without a proposal being submitted by an authorised officer.  If accepted, any modifications would need to be prefaced with the submission of a new proposal by an authorised officer.  The provision, as drafted, is ambiguous and, therefore, could be seen as being left open to exploitation by persons acting in bad faith.  The word &quot;capability&quot; is used in respect of &quot;devices&quot; in this section but this term does not appear in any other section of the Bill.  As a result, it is unclear what the capability of a device means.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 78 and 101 are minor amendments to clarify the specific time period after which local authorities can terminate a CCTV scheme after an approval has been revoked.  The section, as drafted, specifies that the termination shall occur not later than one month after the date on which approval expired or was revoked.  To avoid unnecessary confusion in this respect, these amendments specifies that &quot;one month&quot; should be interpreted as meaning four weeks or &quot;28 days&quot;.<br\/><br\/>Amendments Nos. 79 and 102 are virtually identical in that they both require that any approved CCTV scheme must be accompanied by the publication of transparency notices about the scheme.  Amendment No. 79 is in respect of the amendment to the 1996 Act while amendment No. 102 is in respect of the amendment to the 1997 Act.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The aim of these amendments is for the public to be fully informed about what surveillance is being carried out in their local areas.  The amendments would require every CCTV scheme in a local authority area to be accompanied by surveillance transparency notices, which would be published both online and in physical form in public places in the local authority area.  These notices would outline to the public in detail what cameras are being used and where they are being used, as well as any other technology that may be in use.  These notices would include impartial information about individuals' privacy and data rights so that people can understand how their rights are being violated by such schemes.<\/p><p>If the Minister of State does not see fit to accept our amendments about prohibiting the use of facial recognition technology and other artificial intelligence, the very least we can do is bake this transparency requirement into the legislation.  As I said, I am concerned to see definitions of facial recognition technology and other surveillance technology being inserted into the legislation with no clear identification of their purpose.  Are these definitions being inserted so that the use of facial recognition technology, in conjunction with these approved CCTV schemes, can later be greenlit by the Minister without Oireachtas oversight?  I sincerely hope that is not the case.  If it is, the least we can do is to have minimum standards of transparency for these CCTV schemes.  If they use facial recognition, members of the public have a right to know that their privacy is being violated in this way and that their biometric data are being collected.  Transparency is a baseline, minimum requirement.  A better scenario would be one where no faceprints are collected by the State.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 80 and 103 are virtually identical.  They are duplicates of each other since they both seek to make the same regulations for CCTV schemes.  They refer to the 1996 Act and the 1997 Act.  They ban the combination of CCTV footage from an approved scheme with any artificial intelligence or facial recognition technology.  Specifically, the amendments ban the direct installation of facial recognition technology in approved CCTV cameras, as well as the passing of footage from approved CCTV cameras to a third party for processing with facial recognition software.  In other words, any use of the footage from approved CCTV cameras with this technology would be prohibited.  This is an essential amendment.  As I said, I am concerned to see definitions of facial recognition and other surveillance technology being inserted into the legislation with no clear indication of their purpose.  Are these definitions being inserted to use that facial recognition technology in conjunction with approved CCTV schemes?<\/p><p>The use of facial recognition technology has been disastrous in other territories.  I am alarmed at the casual way in which it has been thrown into legislation.  The Garda facial recognition Bill is coming in the autumn and now this technology is being referred to in a Bill relating to the circular economy.  It appears that the Government does not have any grasp of the wider ramifications of building surveillance into our public lives in this way.  The UK is a terrible example of this, where a cavalier attitude to surveillance technology has resulted in it being used recklessly by police on busy high streets without the public's awareness.  Big Brother Watch calculated that, of the supposed matches from facial recognition use by the Metropolitan Police between 2016 and 2022, 89% were inaccurate.  More than 3,000 people were wrongly identified through facial recognition in that period.  That means that more than 3,000 people were wrongly accused of crimes, yet definitions are being inserted into this legislation without either House ever truly scrutinising what it means to use facial recognition technology in this way.<\/p><p>Very few politicians understand how those data are trained and used and where they go.  By inserting these definitions, we are creating a future issue due to the disastrous, gendered, racist and classist approach to how technology is used in particular countries.  I hope the Minister of State will reflect on my concerns, because this is an essential amendment.  A ban on facial recognition technology is needed so that no CCTV scheme can ever become a biometric data harvesting scheme in the future.  We cannot leave that up to the whims of future Ministers.<\/p><p>On amendment No. 81, section 21 provides for the operation of mobile recording devices by authorised persons for certain purposes, but it does not outline in the same detail the protections as set out for fixed CCTV scheme.  Additionally, what constitutes a mobile recording device is not adequately set out in the legislation.  The absence of a definition of mobile recording device is especially problematic.  It may be inferred as including camcorders, mobile phones, tablets, other handheld devices, drones or other emerging technologies that we are not even aware of yet.  It may be interpreted as including different types of intrusive surveillance technology such as facial recognition technology and other future systems with intrusive capabilities.  Existing surveillance technologies which pose significant human rights concerns may be unknowingly provided for in the legislation because they are not specified.<\/p><p>On the matter of safeguards, there is no mention of unique data impact assessments being necessary prior to granting authorisation.  There is also no reference to visibility or signage for mobile recording devices as required by the data protection law.  It is imperative that these safeguards are included.  It is our view that this section of the Bill should be removed entirely or amended significantly prior to the legislation progressing.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 83 and 85 relate to the development of codes of practice for CCTV schemes.  Specifically, they would prevent CCTV schemes provided for by the legislation from operating prior to the preparation and submission to the Minister of those codes of practice.  I welcome the provision of codes of practice in the legislation.  There are some welcome safeguards set out in them.  However, it is my view that approving and installing CCTV schemes prior to the development and publication of the codes of practice for how they should operate puts the cart before the horse.  We need codes of practice to ensure that the schemes provided for are operated safely, fairly, equally and in a way that complies with human rights.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 84, 85, 106 and 107 are related and should be considered together.  They are minor amendments to the wording of the subsection that sets out the need for local authorities to describe safeguards, security measures and mechanisms being used in their functional area to mitigate risk.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 89 is a minor amendment which seeks to replace the word \"any\" with \"the\" with regard to safeguards in security measures or mechanisms to be implemented by the local authority to mitigate risk.  The use of the word \"any\" in this context gives scope for a local authority to implement none of the safeguards as set out in the section.  These amendments simply strengthen the Bill's provision for the mitigation of risk and leave less scope for safeguards to be sidestepped by a local authority.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 86 and 108 specify that the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, should consult with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission prior to submitting draft codes of practice to the Minister.  The Bill currently provides that the LGMA must consult with relevant Ministers and the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  While consultation with the DPC is a welcome provision, given the wide range of human rights, equality and civil liberties implications, potentially including the freedom of speech and assembly, it is critical that IHREC is consulted in the development of the draft codes of practice.  IHREC is a subject matter expert in this area and it is important to call on its knowledge and experience in the development of codes of practice, which will go a good way in developing safeguards.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 87 and 109 seek to ensure that the evidence obtained through CCTV schemes or personal recording devices under the scheme can only be introduced as evidence in criminal proceedings where it has been obtained on foot of a valid search warrant.  The admissibility or otherwise of evidence should be a matter for the courts and not the Legislature.  The provision is an overreach which unduly extends into the remit of the courts, which are the proper and correct forum to determine whether evidence is admissible following a submission from both the prosecution and the defence.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 88 and 110 delete the presumption in criminal proceedings under the Bill that a recording device is capable of producing accurate information or material, that the information produced by the device in respect of the proceedings was accurate, and that the device was operated in accordance with the codes of practice as set out in the Bill.  It is my view that it should be incumbent on the prosecution in a criminal case to demonstrate that the evidence it has presented to the court is accurate and was obtained in accordance with the relevant codes of practice.  This amendment seeks to achieve this through the deletion of the relevant subsection.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Amendments Nos. 89 and 111 propose to delete the specific offence of damaging a CCTV device.

It seems out of keeping with best practice in legislative drafting.<\/p><p>I have set out a lot of information for the Minister of State.  I thank our office staff for their assistance with these amendments, which we have been working on for some time.  It is a shame the debate on Committee Stage was guillotined because it means I am only speaking on these proposals for the first time on Report Stage.  We did not have time on Committee Stage to move our amendments or tease them out.  As the Minister of State can see, they are extremely substantive.  I am the only one seeking to have a conversation on this part of the Bill, which we will not get to do in the way we could have done on Committee Stage.  That is unfortunate because the issues involved are very important, not only for this Bill but because the questions around the use of CCTV and the polices and procedures around data will be crucial to every legislative proposal we go on to create over the coming years as technology begins to expand and overreach into people's lives and we seek to deal with the human rights abuses that may stem from that.  This is a very important aspect of the Bill.  We should not be giving powers to chief executives of local authorities to use CCTV at a whim without having the full body of knowledge and understanding of the implications of that for people and communities.  I hope the Minister of State will respond in the best possible way to my concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#GGG01500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Senator Ruane has made many good points.

That training requirement is a really important aspect for the Government to roll out across every local authority to ensure they all have the same level of ability to react to this new type of technology.  There has to be a certain level of privacy concerns and an awareness of the impact on civil liberties.  We should make no mistake that technology is here to stay.  I always make the point that technology, particularly AI, evolves at a fast pace that could nearly be said to be lightning speed.  It can be very difficult for governments to keep up with it.<\/p> <p>I do not agree with everything proposed in these amendments but I like the overall flow of what is being proposed.

I have expressed some concerns before about the issues they raise.  When we had a debate in this House on a Bill brought forward by Senator Malcolm Byrne dealing with similar issues, we were told the Government was looking at the matter and needed more detail.  I am aware that a number of local authorities have had severe fines imposed on them relating to surveillance practices.  In some cases, they related to focused and targeted surveillance of Travellers.  The councils were found to be in serious breach of their responsibilities and duties in regard to data and so on.<\/p> <p>We must be careful in how we approach these issues.  I understand the motive and reasoning for what is proposed in the Bill but I also understand the issues around civil liberties and the impact on the freedoms of citizens.  The provision for a surveillance transparency notice is really important.  I spoke to a person who has a similar CCTV system in operation on a commercial premises.  When I asked how a person who trespassed on the premises would know he or she was being surveilled, I was told about the obligations the business has in this regard.  There are clearly visible notices displayed and when someone comes into a certain zone, a recording is played announcing that the person has entered a CCTV-monitored security area.  There are warnings in place.<\/p> <p>I have very serious concerns about the issues Senator Ruane is seeking to address in these amendments.  She has articulated her proposals well and they are very reasonable.  Knowing the Minister of State, I believe he will have some sympathy with them.  He has a certain amount of expertise in this area.  Senator Ruane has made a good case for the amendments and they are worthy of support.  It certainly is an issue we will have to return to and review and it potentially is an area of concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KKK00300","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":606,"content":"<p>As seconder of the amendments, I will not reiterate all of the points that have been made.  This discussion began when we were debating the Data Protection Act 2018 in the previous Seanad and that discussion has followed through to this debate.  This is an issue of very serious concern to all of us in our group and we have engaged very actively on it, including in respect of the debates on the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive, the digital services directive and the AI directive.  All of these issues are fundamental to society and to civil liberties.<\/p> <p>I support and commend my colleague's amendments.  She has articulated proposals that would properly apply the brakes to our moving ahead in areas such as the use of facial recognition technology, including on personal devices.  We need to think ahead and plan for the future.  We must look to how facial recognition technology has been used in China and the UK, for example, and some of the laws in regard to public assembly that have been brought forward in the UK.  The provision we put in place for surveillance architecture is extremely important generally, no matter its particular purpose in a specific instance.<\/p> <p>I note amendment No. 64 seeks to create a penalty for incredibly large-scale dumping of certain goods.  However, the dumping of comparatively smaller amounts of goods is being used to justify quite extreme measures in terms of potential surveillance.  My colleague's amendments rightly look to apply the brakes in this regard but she has also offered compromise amendments that would at least seek to insert transparency safeguards.  For instance, given there is a requirement for necessity and proportionality in any use of personal data, she is seeking to ensure we make decisions as to whether a measure is proportional or necessary based on how it has been used in the year or two previously, before it is renewed.  These are immensely detailed and forensic amendments.  I strongly urge the Minister of State to engage with them.  I really regret that we do not have the opportunity to go back and forth on them properly and tease them out.  They relate to very significant issues with very significant implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KKK00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>The big problem we are trying to address in this part of the Bill is the problem of illegal dumping and littering and the fact it has become nearly impossible in recent years for local authorities to prosecute people for carrying out those crimes.  We all suffer as a result.  As we move around the countryside or walk on the streets, we see litter, sofas dumped in fields and so on.  It has become very hard to obtain a prosecution for such offences.  Public awareness campaigns are all very well but they do not work on people who are making money out of intentionally breaking the law.<\/p> <p>We need to prosecute such offences and in order to do that, we need to have evidence and that evidence must be obtained within the law.  We asked the Data Protection Commission and the Attorney General what we need to do to make it lawful for a local authority to prosecute somebody and how we can, at the same time, maintain people's privacy rights.  We have to balance the right of all of us to enjoy the countryside without being surrounded by pollution against the right to privacy and not to be subject to mass surveillance all the time.  The answer is to introduce provision for a very restricted form of CCTV surveillance, with as many safeguards as we can devise.  For example, facial recognition and automatic number plate recognition technologies are specifically excluded by the legislation.  Surveillance can only be done on a particular site for a particular period of time.  The cameras must be overt rather than covert and the evidence obtained can only be used to prosecute the crimes of littering and dumping.  It is only possible to use alternative forms of gathering evidence such as drones or body cameras in the case of commercial dumping, which is a very serious offence.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Ossian Smyth:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We were advised, when we talked to the Attorney General and so on, that we could not use that for littering because it is minor offence.  All the way through, our approach has been characterised by taking a proportionate approach.  We have very broad support for this from the public and across all political parties.  In fact, a number of Senators introduced similar legislation that did not have the degree of safeguards we have brought in.  People are sick of the fact that some can make money by dumping rubbish in the countryside and cannot be prosecuted for it.  We need to fix that.<\/p><p>There is a balance of rights.  The right to privacy is not absolute and the right to live in a clean society has a value.  There is a balance to be struck and this is the balance.  I am sorry there are so many substantial amendments here that I cannot consider in detail.  I would love to work with Senator Ruane on that.  As Senator Boyhan said, I have long had an interest in digital privacy and so on and the right not be surveilled in such a way.  We need these limitations.  We went a very long way in this legislation to do everything we possibly could to limit the use of CCTV and to balance the right to privacy against the right to live in a clean environment.  If Senator Ruane withdraws her amendments, I will co-operate with her and work constructively and openly with her to try to achieve her objectives as far as possible.  That goes for Senator Higgins as well.  I will work with her on the issues she raised around procurement in the coming months if she withdraws her amendments.  That way, we can go ahead and not have this Bill rammed through, which I do not want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#KKK00500","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":609,"content":"<p>I hope we can work together to look at the substantive issues here.  I do not think anyone is arguing in favour of covering up or turning a blind eye to illegal dumping or against the value of a clean space.  To argue for these amendments is not to argue against that.  This is about how to create a society that finds a way to reduce that while also not having a negative impact on other communities that may be inadvertently impacted by someone else's behaviour, which has nothing to do with them, even with the safeguards in place.  The Minister of State is saying the safeguards are there with regard to facial recognition.  There are things defined in the legislation but there is no reference to them in the rest of the Bill.  Why would something be defined within the legislation at all if is not going to be used?  I do not understand why that would be in the legislation in the first place.  My fear is that, while there is limited scope in this Bill around the definitions and giving powers to chief executives to make decisions on applications for CCTV, it will set a precedent.  When it comes to technology and setting precedent in any legislation, we need to make sure we are thinking of future legislation and how this legislation can be used or abused to create other avenues for local authorities to give licences and stuff for whatever they want.  A local community could claim illegal dumping is happening somewhere but it might be relatively small.  Some chief executive would then come under local pressure from councillors and decide to put CCTV there.  There would be no checks or balances on that.  There would also be no notices to the public that it is there in the first place.<\/p> <p>I live at the foot of the Dublin Mountains.  I drive and walk up around Kiltipper Hill and I see the dumping that happens there.  It is also very close to a working-class community that struggles to pay for its waste and refuse.  People there struggle to buy extra bins.  Poverty sometimes creates some of those sites.  I am not talking about those at the large scale the Minister of State is talking about in the countryside.  Within communities there may be local councillors who want to be seen to be doing something about what is a relatively small issue and is actually a result of poverty.  That is why we need to make sure a chief executive does not have the power to make those decisions.  There must be an understanding about why an issue might be happening.  In some cases people are not criminals making money from this; people are struggling.  There are people in my community who burn their rubbish out the back, with black smoke coming up in the middle of housing estates.  That is where these issues intersect.  There have to be safeguards when it comes to technology to protect communities that are acting out of poverty and not to make a profit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#LLL00200","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1657182600,"counter":610,"content":"<p>Amendment,

This was an issue that was highlighted as a matter of concern during the course of pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>This is a really important matter given we cannot afford to continue our extraction of fossil fuels of any kind.  The decision made about gas as part of the EU taxonomy was the wrong one.  Gas is a fossil fuel.  It is not in any way, shape or form sustainable, except for green hydrogen.  Natural gas certainly is not a green fuel or a renewable resource.  Natural gas is ultimately part of an extraction model.  We have been told by the UN and others we simply cannot afford to extract any further fossil fuels.  Accordingly, some of these amendments relate to natural gas and it being named in this regard.  There may be other legislation that touches on it but given the spirit of these measures on coal and lignite, I wanted to have it named in this section of the Bill.<\/p> <p>The other amendments relate more directly because the Minerals Development Act is at issue.  They very explicitly relate to precious minerals and precious metals.  My amendments in those respects look to insert \"precious metals\" into a number of provisions here.  I propose to put in the phrase, \"precious metals\", because fundamentally we are at a point in resource management where we need to be looking to the absolute best use of the finite resources we have on this planet.  One of the things that fuels the fact we have those kinds of waste and disposal we heard about in some of those earlier amendments, including a disposability of electronic goods, is the idea we can constantly access more.  One of the most important measures we can take to ensure we move away from the dumping of electronic and other goods is if the source, and indeed the only source, for the accessing of new precious metals and the expansion and use of those is through the reuse and best possible resource management of precious metals.  We should be looking at centuries of use for any precious metals that have been extracted, because they last that long.  There are vast amounts of precious metals - in fact you can mine more gold from discarded tech than you can from a relative volume of mineral ore.  Instead, we have continued with an infinite extraction model.  That continued extraction of resources is the one part of the chain that fits with infinite consumption.  One of the ways we address it is not just by trying to curtail or encourage different consumption but by cutting off the idea of infinite extraction.  Again, it may well be the case that down the line there may be minerals that need to be extracted but right now, when we are not making the proper use of those precious metals we already have in circulation on this planet, we should not be extracting anything further from the ground.  We need to get it right on what we are already using before we look elsewhere.<\/p> <p>We should bear in mind we have treasure trove measures in Ireland that are really good.  The measures recognise that when people dig up torcs and the like, there are certain things that cannot be commercially used but are in fact national property and that they are a national and a public good.  Their significance is not one that exists in the commercial realm but one that exists culturally and for us as a society.  We need to have a similar perspective about precious metals.  The best service for precious metals, both internationally and in Ireland, is for them to be left in the ground and for us to look to strong, dynamic measures for ensuring the reuse and proper recovery of precious metals that have already been extracted.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There will not be incentives for that while there is the opportunity instead to have a constant chain of extraction.  I am deeply concerned as are the Communities Against the Injustice of Mining which I already mentioned, but there are many other individuals across Ireland who are concerned.  I have spoken about the international piece in this regard because it relates to the territory of Ireland, including both our land territory and our waters, but I am going to speak to mining within Ireland.<\/p><p>There is an all-Ireland cross-Border network of groups and individuals who have been very active on issues such as mining, prospecting for minerals, fracking and other forms of extractive-ism.  They called for the amendments to the Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill because they recognise that primacy should be given to alternative economic activities that are based on the sustainable use and recovery of renewable resources such as recycling, recovery of precious metals and that the Minister should not be allowing for continued prospecting or extraction until we have every measure in place for precious metals.  There are other amendments earlier in this Bill to try to give stronger effect to legislation in respect of precious metals.  Until we have used our full legislative strength to address the issue of the use of these metals, we should not be looking to new mining.  However, in opposition to that what we have actually seen is an expansion in the request for mining.<\/p><p>The Natura strategic environmental assessment statements for mineral exploration and mining which the Government has produced repeats claim that minerals have a critical role in respect of ambitions on the climate action plan and the transition to an effective circular economy.  However, there have not been measures that look to recycling, reuse, recovery and repair as being the alternative activities to mining in that regard.  Again, I am going to push this on to areas such as gold mining in the north west, where we have seen very little gold in industry or for products, yet we are seeing it mainly extracted as an area for the storage of wealth.  It is an extreme area in that respect and is regarded by some as a way of storing and hoarding wealth.  We know that there are large amounts of bank vaults which are brimming with gold and much of the use of gold is in respect of the trade in it as a speculative commodity.<\/p><p>The mining industries here in Ireland, and indeed internationally, are infamous in respect of their pollution of water courses.  The biodiversity and extinction crisis which we face in parallel with our climate crisis do not allow for the despoliation of new areas and in the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and environmental reports Ireland has been found to have watercourses that are very degraded and in very poor condition.<\/p><p>The key argument around giving permission for new extractive line products in this discussion is where I want to touch on the idea of electric cars and the use of those minerals.  We do not have caveats and legislation around restricting how precious minerals and metals are being used.  Not only do we not have measures on their recovery, responsible management, their recycling, production, life cycles and the goods that contain them, but we also do not have measures which say that precious metals must only be used in measures that further us in either the circular economy or indeed the transition that we need in areas such as electricity.  Having a continued extractive model in respect of mining, when we have taken none of the necessary legislative steps around how metals are used, is again not acceptable.<\/p><p>We know that there have been submissions, and in fact I have put in one or two of them, on the plethora of measures on exploration licences and the prospecting potential, which are of course a step for prospecting licences for mining in the country.  There is a large number of concessions for mineral exploration in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the continued collection of data by Geological Survey Ireland on land for offshore mineral resources relates to what we are talking about in the paper potential of prospecting licences.  These, in themselves, trade and change hands as commodities.  They come each time with new measures and geological surveys and this surveying activity in itself has biodiversity implications.  This is therefore a commodities market in precious mineral prospects which is having a direct impact again.<\/p><p>The creation of alternative energy has been mentioned again but as I mentioned, we do not have measures which limit the use of minerals in that regard.  Again, we are looking largely at the licences for exploration or prospecting that are being granted.  They are being given to commercial actors but that is no guarantee as to how or whatever they may mine or extract or how it may be used.<\/p><p>I mentioned the idea of the national good of the gold that we find from past millennia and that it be taken out of the commercial space.  Similarly, I put it to the Minister of State that in fact our precious metals here in Ireland should be managed as a national resource, not through commercial companies or through the licensing or the partnership with commercial companies, but through full national ownership of the precious metals that are in our State, with the recognition that in the current climate, economy and situation with legislation and provisions for the use of precious metals, the best national use of that national resource is to keep it in the ground.<\/p><p>That is why I want the same limitation that is given to coal and lignite to be included for precious metals and their extraction prohibited by this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#MMM04500","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and call on the Minister of State to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022070700002#NNN00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1657182600,"counter":675,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s overall policy on mineral exploration and mining is under review at the moment and is currently the subject of an ongoing process of engagement with stakeholders and this will all be examined in detail.  The policy statement on mineral exploration and mining is being finalised.  That follows a public consultation.  This policy statement proposes that the legislative schedule of minerals for which exploration and mining is permitted should be reviewed.  I can confirm that an advisory group will be convened to review my Department&rsquo;s proposals in that regard.<\/p> <p>This important review will reflect the principle that our use of Ireland&rsquo;s mineral resources must first be balanced by conservation. Second, it must support our transition to the circular economy and carbon neutrality.  Finally, it must promote equitable development, including international and intergenerational equity, as well as generating economic activity through commercial enterprise.<\/p> <p>Amendments Nos. 112 and 115 specifically relate to natural gas.  The exploration for and the development of petroleum, which includes natural gas, is regulated by the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960.  Amendments to that Act last year gave legislative effect to the programme for Government commitment to end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of oil or gas.<\/p> <p>The forthcoming policy statement on mineral exploration will propose that the legislative schedule of minerals for which exploration and mining is permitted be reviewed and, for clarity, the removal of natural gas from this schedule will be included in the review.<\/p> <p>Finally, amendment No. 114 relates to the Akw&eacute; Kon Guidelines.  These guidelines are intended to serve as guidance to governments, subject to their national legislation, in the development and implementation of their impact-assessment regimes.  The Akw&eacute; Kon Guidelines were adopted by the seventh COP to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2004 and Ireland is a party to that convention.  Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of the convention is reflected in the National Biodiversity Action Plan, which is, in turn, to be reflected in the policy statement on mineral exploration and mining.<\/p> <p>The issues of community consent, or &ldquo;social legitimacy&rdquo;, and biological diversity will be examined in detail and transparently in the context of the Government&rsquo;s overall policy on mineral exploration and mining.

I tried to address those many loopholes in that legislation at the relevant time.  Again, that is why I am taking a second pass at it here because it was exceptionally generous.  In almost any situation, people had a half expectation that once they had begun thinking about looking for natural gas, they could continue to be awarded licences.  That is a real problem because we are in danger of a race towards the acceleration of gas extraction at the moment, which is something the world cannot afford.  I deplore the decision that has been made in respect of the taxonomy in that regard.  It gives a lack of credibility to the definition of green investment at an EU level and diminishes Europe's going into the COP negotiations and any other circumstances and our credibility regarding those matters.  <\/p><p>Regarding the Akw&eacute;: Kon guidelines and the convention on biological diversity, I welcome the fact that the Minister is looking to these areas but I will note two or three matters that are really important as the Minister of State considers them.  One is that it would be free, prior and informed consent of the local community so that we do not have a situation where An Bord Plean&aacute;la is able to overrule the concerns of a local community in respect of mining because it is explicit that it would be the local community's consent and agreement.  It involves measures be they FEMPI measures in terms of factors of overriding public interest, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and other measures or indeed the policies relating to extraction at the national level.  The Akw&eacute;: Kon guidelines are really clear that it is the local community's full, free, prior and informed consent that is the determining factor.  Those guidelines do not allow for it to be balanced against some other considerations be they economic, social or other considerations.  That is important.  It concerns the normal planning process and even the measures, which I deplore in general, where we have seen a lot of overriding of local planning decisions in terms of a shift towards going directly in some cases.  I mentioned quarries.  There may be situations where you have substitute consent and then supplementary decisions that are going directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  They would not be in line with the Akw&eacute;: Kon guidelines.  <\/p><p>I am glad that a policy is being looked at this in regard.  However, it is my strong conviction that pending a proper policy or better prevention and being in line with the precautionary principle at EU level, we should have a moratorium on any extraction of precious metals pending a situation whereby we have a full suite of appropriate legislative hard policy measures that ensure it is done not just in a responsible and regulated way but only in a way that benefits our larger national good and environmental concerns.
