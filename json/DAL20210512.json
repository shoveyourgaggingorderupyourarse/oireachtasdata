This is vital infrastructure in an area that suffered from inaction for many generations and that is still suffering from it in some cases.  The area has a low level of educational attainment and a high unemployment rate.  It is recognised throughout Dublin and beyond for its concentration of local authority housing complexes, or flats.  Also in the area is Guinness, with all the employment it has brought.<\/p>  <p>  I was elected in 2002 and the Digital Hub started in 2003.  I was a champion of it from day one because it was located in the Liberties to play a major role not only in trying to regenerate the area but also in linking in to the community.  It has done tremendous work over 20 years in reaching out to and helping communities.  It has also done tremendous work in the educational field, including in local schools, and has encouraged people one might not have thought would have had a chance in the world of being employed by one of the companies in the hub.  The hub is to the fore in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, a decision was made that the Digital Hub Development Agency, DHDA, should be merged.  In 2013, it was announced that it would be merged with Dublin City Council, or that the council would take care over its governance.  Since then, I have continuously asked for word on this in the D&aacute;il Chamber only to discover last year that there was a Grant Thornton review.  It took a year for the Minister to look at it.  I do not know why it took that long.  Then, lo and behold, out of the blue and with no logic whatsoever, a decision was made to end one of the most successful regeneration initiatives in the Liberties, Dublin, send the companies out of the area and build more houses.  While I agree we need more housing now, including houses for families, this is a land grab by the Land Development Agency, LDA.  Somebody else can talk about what the Land Development Agency stands for.  My biggest problem is that although we have been told continuously for the past several years that there is a need for sustainable jobs and communities, an initiative that has already proven to be sustainable is being closed down.  The jobs will move out to the suburbs.  That is not sustainable.  It means people living in the area have to move and travel to work.  This area has shown over the years that industry, big and small, can co-live with communities.  There are many other sites on city council or State land that could be utilised for housing in the area.  There is even land within the Digital Hub area that is surplus to requirements, or not suited to its requirements, that could have been earmarked for housing.  To collapse the Digital Hub in the way the Minister is suggesting is absolutely illogical and ridiculous, and it needs to be reversed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200003#A00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speech","time":1620807000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy for raising this question.  The decision in the late 1990s to establish the Digital Hub project in the Liberties was made in the light of the success of other digital enterprise clusters around the world.  The initiative was an important element of Government policy to develop Dublin as a location for digital enterprise.  The DHDA was established in 2003 as a statutory body to oversee the Digital Hub project and it played a key role in the early days of Dublin's development as a location for digital enterprise.  Since 2003, there have been many positive developments in the wider policy and economic environment that have seen Dublin develop as a significant European hub for digital enterprise, with developments throughout the city, most notably in the digital docklands in Dublin 2.  We have only to look across the river to see all the large technology companies that have located in Dublin as a result.<\/p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Department commissioned Grant Thornton to conduct an independent review of the policy underpinning the DHDA to inform policy as to its future, including the question as to whether it continued to be required to meet a socioeconomic need.  The report concluded that the DHDA is not required to sustain the principal reason for which it was established, that of the continued growth and development of Dublin's digital enterprise sector.  This informed the Government's decision to close the DHDA and transfer the properties to the Land Development Agency.  The Government remains fully committed to the regeneration of the Liberties area of Dublin 8 and is of a view that the redevelopment by the Land Development Agency of the DHDA properties, in conjunction with properties in the area owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW and Dublin City Council, represents a priority and transformative project for Dublin.  This will provide a greater contribution in addressing other market and societal needs beyond digital enterprise, including the construction of social and affordable housing, along with civic, community and retail development.  The board of the DHDA will be asked to prepare an exit plan for an orderly wind-down, to be implemented by an expected date in mid-2022.  It will address the needs of the staff of the DHDA, the client companies and communications with the local communities.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department will work closely with the agency on the finalisation of the necessary steps, including the redeployment of its permanent staff within the public sector.<\/p> <p> The 31 client companies, with 270 employees, that are currently located at the Digital Hub campus are under no immediate pressure to move and will be able to continue trading as normal throughout the wind-down period.  It is anticipated that during that time the client companies will find alternative accommodation, having regard to the finding of the report in respect of the robust supply of co-working and office space available in Dublin.  That supply has only increased in the past year.<\/p> <p> Finally, the Government recognises the important role the local community plays in the successful regeneration of the area.  In this regard, the Department has committed to continue making funding available in order that the agency can continue its community engagement programmes throughout the wind-down period.  The Department met the LDA following the Government decision and is keenly aware of the need for and value of community engagement as part of its plans for the regeneration of the area.  The Department will work closely with the DHDA, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the LDA to ensure that the wind-down takes account of the needs of the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200003#A00400","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620807600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I do not think the mandarins, the Minister of State or the senior Minister get exactly what the Digital Hub was.  It was a beacon in an area which has suffered significant dereliction through the years and has significant need for regeneration.  Just when it was achieving success, it is being closed down.  In fact, it has been successful from day one, but even recently it was discussing a significant contract with St. James's Hospital.  I presume that is now gone out the window.  It involved moving towards digital and medical devices and research and the likes.  That is not going to happen under the control or the watch of the Digital Hub or Dublin City Council, which was to take over.<\/p>  <p>  We have seen today that the Dublin City Council city manager basically stated that he was not consulted in any shape or form on this issue, yet when I asked about the matter last year, I was told the whole intention was for this to be transferred to Dublin City Council.

That land has not even been considered.  I asked a question about that only last week and it was announced that it is not being considered.  It is not just small patches of land here, there and everywhere; I am talking about an area that is even bigger than the entire Digital Hub site.<\/p>  <p>  Although the Minister of State claims that those working at the Digital Hub can continue to work during the wind-down, they have basically been given a year to pack up their bags and get out.

It brought something that was almost inconceivable, namely, the idea of very high-tech companies locating operations in the Liberties, on land formerly occupied by the Guinness company, in what was traditionally a major manufacturing area.  It has served that role and the review found that has now been provided for.  We have the National Digital Research Centre, Dogpatch Labs and other accelerators.  There is plenty of office space in the area.  The review found that there is no longer a need for what had been provided, but that it had delivered a great degree of regeneration in the area.  It also found that what is needed now is housing and that the LDA can provide 500 homes for 500 families in the area.  That is a form of regeneration.  It will not just be housing on its own, it will also be civic spaces and everything that goes along with creating a real community that is not just apartment blocks or transient workers but is actually focused on the long-term and sustainable creation of communities, which is really the heart of regeneration.<\/p>  <p>  There will continue to be various other locations for high-tech start-ups or where people can start businesses and so on.  We know that in the course of the past year there has been a move away from the idea that we absolutely need physical space for office work to happen.  At least half of office workers will probably be working from home.  The demand for office space will be reduced as a result.  People have got used to virtual working.<\/p>  <p>  Our current focus is on housing.

It is going to become very important and it is absolutely critical that a coherent plan to address it is put in place.  Just as much thought should be put into that plan as went into the Covid crisis.  The truth is that the health service will face a backlog of treatment and people seeking treatment at a time when hospital staff are stressed out after a very difficult period.  It is really important that the management goes into how this can be dealt with in a fair way.<\/p>  <p>  The data speak for themselves.  Inpatient numbers stand at 80,000.  Surprisingly, that is only up 10,000 or 14%.  Many people may have thought that, with two years of disruption, it would have increased by more.  The number of outpatients is 630,000, an increase of 82,000, or 15%, compared with two years ago, before Covid struck.  The numbers have got worse but are not as bad as people might think.  However, if one looks beneath the numbers to see how many have been waiting more than a year, that is where the real rub comes.  The number waiting more than a year for inpatient treatment is 24,000, comprising nearly one third of all those waiting.  That number has more than doubled in the past two years.  A similar picture is presented in the context of outpatients, with 284,000 waiting more than 12 months, an increase of 70%.  They comprise very close to half of all those on those lists.  There is no doubt that a new wave of people will soon have the confidence to go back and schedule treatments and appointments.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, these numbers are manageable.  Every year, 3 million outpatients are seen and, against that background, a figure of 600,000 is manageable.  More than 1 million patients are discharged from hospitals and, in that context, a figure of 80,000 seems manageable.  We know, however, that there will be a very mixed picture of various people, some of whose conditions will have deteriorated significantly.  A risk-based approach to this will be needed.  What planning is going into that?<\/p>  <p>  We will need innovation in the way this is approached.  For example, it would be good to have GP-supported reviews looking at critical indicators that would be presented to the lead consultants and their teams such that a review of the condition of various patients could effectively be done remotely.  Remote consultation should be extended.  It became a pattern when it was a necessity during the Covid crisis, but, as the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention and we should make sure that remote consultations become embedded.  They can be very effective in the context of some disciplines in circumstances where a procedure is not necessary and a face-to-face consultation is not always needed.  Some of that face-to-face element could be carried out in GP surgeries and there could be more of a team approach to attacking this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to see the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, integrated into such a plan.  There is no doubt that during Covid it has not been using resources to the level it did previously, so it may have reserve budget.  It would be very good to see it integrating into the approach.<\/p>  <p>  I am calling for a planned, strategic approach to this issue, one which considers fairness and how to use the resources available in the way that is most efficient and innovative in order to avoid a build-up of people who feel the urgency of their cases has been overlooked by those managing the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200004#B00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1620808200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bruton for raising this issue, on which I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that the waiting times for hospital appointments, procedures and services have been impacted in the past year by Covid-19.  On 23 March last, the HSE published A Safe Return to Health Services plan.  The plan outlined a three-phase approach for the proposed restoration of services across community services, acute hospital operations, cancer services and screening services.  It sets target times for the safe return and details the conditions and challenges that will have to be met.  Every phase in the plan has been informed by clinical guidance, putting patient and staff safety first.<\/p>  <p>  A key action of this Government is to address the backlog in the demand for services that may have arisen across all healthcare settings since the onset of the pandemic.  Budget 2021 included central commitments to provide funding to improve access to services and reduce the number of people waiting for important appointments and procedures.  Hospital inpatient day case, IPDC, waiting lists reached a peak in May 2020 due to the deferral of elective care.  However, as a result of modified pathways to care and utilising innovative methods of providing scheduled care, the growth trend in the IPDC waiting list was reversed and the number waiting for a hospital appointment procedure dropped by 8% from the end of May 2022 to the end of March 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;240 million has been provided in budget 2021 to improve access to care for acute hospital procedures, &euro;210 million of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  This will be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of the measures taken in the context of Covid-19 as well as to address hospital waiting lists.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand for mental health services.  Launched in January, the HSE psychological response to the Covid-19 pandemic provides a clear framework to build on existing psychological support to the public and healthcare workers with a co-ordinated, consistent and collaborative approach to the mental health services.  An additional &euro;2.2 million was allocated in 2020 to develop telehealth and the psychological response to Covid-19 for healthcare workers and the general public.<\/p>  <p>  As part of budget 2021, an additional &euro;50 million funding was secured for mental health, bringing the annual budget to in excess of &euro;1 billion.  Of the additional &euro;50 million, &euro;23 million is allocated to the implementation of many of Sharing the Vision&rsquo;s short-term recommendations and &euro;15 million to address the additional challenges posed by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the challenges faced in primary care, the Department of Health secured &euro;150 million in funding for an enhanced community care programme in budget 2021.  This represents an unprecedented investment in our primary sector that will see the establishment of community health networks and specialist teams to serve older persons and those with chronic disease, as well as other initiatives such as the nationwide expansion of the community intervention teams.  A focus of the enhanced community care programme is on the recruitment of front-line staff, particularly nurses and community therapists, to build capacity in the sector to help address waiting lists and backlogs in appointments, while helping to ensure the primary care sector is sustainable over the long term.  <\/p>  <p>  On cancer care services, the national action plan on Covid-19 identified the continued provision of cancer care as a priority.  Cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme.  Funding of &euro;12 million has been allocated this year for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of the 2019 pre-Covid levels.  This funding will support hospitals in addressing the backlog.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200005#C00100","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1620808200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and welcome that a plan is in place and there is innovative thinking within it.

It should also involve GPs.  The oversight team must also have the capacity to step in and intervene.  It is all very well to record the data but there has to be capacity to intervene and manage this process in a way that is in the interests of public health.<\/p>  <p>  We have, to some degree, become used to people telling us how we must manage in this pandemic but if we want to avoid backlogs getting out of control, similar powers must be provided to managers to step in and require things to be done in individual hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  I am gratified to see that in my area, Beaumont Hospital is one of the few hospitals where both outpatient and inpatient waiting numbers have declined.  That is a sign of good management of a process and needs to be done at scale.  In addition to publishing a plan that shows how to do this safely and well, we must also monitor how effective the innovation is and the extent to which remote diagnosis is being used in an innovative way, the extent to which GPs are being given the opportunity to participate in the prioritisation of cases that are drawn on the basis of need, and how the NTPF responds to these need assessments as simply using its procedures to determine that action is needed on an individual case because it has been ongoing for nine months.

This was done monthly by the managers of the various disciplines in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, around country and we have driven down the backlog by 78% in eight months.  That is exactly what the Deputy is talking about, namely, ensuring that the leads in the various CHOs are held to account.  The Minister is responsible for bringing them to order on a monthly basis to see exactly how we are prioritising.

This includes increased use of private hospitals funding; weekend and evening work in public hospitals; funding see-and-treat services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations; funding hybrid services for public and private hospitals which contribute to the treatment of patients; virtual clinics; and clinical validation.  The additional &euro;240 million provided in budget 2021 will positively impact waiting times for patients waiting for acute hospital appointments and procedures.

I and a number of other candidates visited the school and I promised I would return if I was elected.

There are over 40 children at the school aged between four and 18 years with severe to profound learning disabilities.  It plays an incredibly important role in Cork city and the surrounding area.

It is cold and, in some respects, exposed.  The staff, management, parents and the committee there have done incredible work in making the most of the building, but the fact is that it is long past its sell-by date.  It used to be a primary school, Scoil Colm Ban, until the late 1990s when it amalgamated with Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh and the building became available.

My main request is that she tell the House that there will be a new building that is fit for the needs of the school on a new site as well as that she give an update on progress on the interim work, which is badly needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200006#D00200","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1620808800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to the accommodation needs of St. Gabriel's Special School in Bishopstown, County Cork.  This matter has been raised with me by a number of public representatives, including my Cabinet colleagues and the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  St. Gabriel's Special School is the primary school under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity.  The school caters for children and teenagers aged four to 18 years of age with severe and profound learning disability and those in this category with associated autistic spectrum disorder, ASD.  The current staffing at the school includes a principal, eight mainstream teachers and 30 special needs assistants, SNAs, with an enrolment in 2021 of 43 pupils.  St. Gabriel's Special School is currently accommodated in a former primary school building.  Another former primary school building adjoins St. Gabriel's and St. Gabriel's has secured the use of some additional space in this property, as has been outlined.  Both school buildings are owned by the Diocese of Cork and Ross.<\/p>  <p>  This property has the potential to offer the school valuable extra space to meet its accommodation needs.  Remedial work is required to the property to facilitate its use by St. Gabriel's.  The Department has been liaising with the school regarding its accommodation needs.  An architect and an engineer from the Department's building unit recently visited the school.  It is intended that the visit will assist in identifying proposed works that could be undertaken in the building, taking account of the specific needs of the school.  The Department is also engaging with the Diocese of Cork and Ross, as owner of the buildings, in this regard.  The Department is committed to providing for the school's long-term accommodation needs and is considering all the options available.  It will continue to engage with the school in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for the Government.  The Department's policy is that children with special educational needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special schools and special class places are provided for.  This year, the Department will invest over 20% of its education budget, or &euro;2 billion, in supporting children with special needs.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants, special classes and special school places are at unprecedented levels.  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 235%, from 548 to over 1,800 for the 2020-2021 school year.  Some 199 new special classes have been established nationally for the 2020-2021 school year.  Budget 2021 also provides for an additional 235 special class teachers this year, supporting the provision of over 1,200 additional special classes.  An additional 990 special needs assistants brings the provision of special needs assistants to a record of more than 18,000.  An additional 145 special education teachers brings the total provision to more than 13,000 in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, with an additional 23 special education teachers to be allocated to meet increased enrolments in special schools.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, I am acutely aware that there are parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.  The Department's schools building programme is focused on providing additional school places to ensure that every child, including children with special needs, has a school place.  This includes opening new schools and extending existing schools in areas where more school places are needed to meet the growing number of children living in these areas.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and patrons.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  It continues to work with and support the families who have a recommendation for, and are seeking to secure, a special school placement.  A number of meetings between the Department, the NCSE and relevant stakeholders, including patron bodies, have taken place to consider how the demand for special school places in Cork can be met.  The Deputies will be aware that new special schools in Cork and Dublin will be established for the 2021-2022 school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200006#D00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1620808800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on the work she has done up to now in respect of the delivery of special education provision in Cork, particularly in recent months.

However, I will return to St. Gabriel's and the specifics of that case.  The majority of special needs schools in Cork, particularly schools that cater for dual diagnosis, are full.  Therefore, the problem in St. Gabriel's is not going away.  I understand that as far back as 2018, a departmental official said that the Department was committed to the provision of a new school building for St. Gabriel's, that a new site was required to facilitate this and that the Department was engaging with a landowner in this regard.  It is three years since that statement so we must move this forward.  As far as I am aware, consideration is being given to joining another education provider on a new site.

I have a letter from 2020 which finally gives me a copy of the report and tells me there are other reviews.  The report states the development of a deepwater quay in Ros an Mh&iacute;l is essential to the area.  It points out that for 600 km between Na Cealla Beaga and Castletownbere there is no port with proper facilities and notes the importance of developing one in Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  We have a report that is equally as strong in what it says about the need for development in Galway for socioeconomic reasons of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, it its submission on the port in Galway, made the point that this is essential and said it was very important to develop Ros an Mh&iacute;l.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than doing it in this manner, I ask that the Minister meet Deputies locally and give urgent clarification on what the Department has in mind in relation to the development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  I understand there is an existing permission that will run out so there is a necessity for clarity on the provision of the funds agus i ndeireadh na d&aacute;la t&aacute;imid ag caint faoi airgead suarach i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.  It is a small amount of money in the scheme of things and given the importance of the development for the region.  I hope for clarity in both languages today.

Ros an Mh&iacute;l Fishery Harbour Centre is one of six designated fishery harbour centres owned, managed and maintained by my Department under statute.  The others are located at Castletownbere, Dingle, Dunmore East, Howth and Killybegs.  Approximately 26 vessels are based in Ros an Mh&iacute;l with whitefish being the primary catch.  The harbour also sees between 20 and 25 fishing boats from the east coast, carrying mainly prawns and whitefish.  There are virtually no foreign landings at Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  Ros an Mh&iacute;l is a primary harbour for passenger travel to the Aran Islands and the harbour centre provides facilities in support of passenger and cargo ferries to the Aran Islands which are invaluable to the residents of same and act as a catalyst for development of the island-based tourism industry.<\/p>  <p>  The Fishery Harbour Centres Act of 1968 established the concept of fishery harbours in the State and vested their management in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took over responsibility for these harbour centres in October 2007.  All six are strategically important infrastructure which underpin the Government's strategy to further develop a modern offshore Irish fishing fleet to attract large offshore fishing vessels of other member states to increasingly land in our harbour centres and also to drive the development of a modern onshore processing industry.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for capital developments is made available on an annual basis by the Department to the harbour centres, including Ros an Mh&iacute;l, via the fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme.  A phased programme for the infrastructural development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l has been progressed over recent years and has seen significant investment.  In total, approximately &euro;31.6 million was invested in capital development at Ros an Mh&iacute;l between 2000 and 2020.  In addition, &euro;1.09 million has been allocated for capital works in the harbour in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The possibility of a deepwater berthing project at Ros an Mh&iacute;l has been mooted for some time.  The Department commissioned DKM consultants to conduct a cost-benefit analysis into the development of a deepwater quay at Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  A draft report was submitted to the Department in June 2017.  Since the report was drafted, there have been changes to some of the fundamentals underpinning the original analysis.  In 2018, the Department commissioned engineering consultants to undertake a review of the design solutions, scoping options and operational aspects of a possible future project.  An interim draft of the quay wall peer review report was received in April 2019.<\/p> <p>It identified the need for additional site investigations to be carried out at Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  They were carried out in August and September 2019 and have been completed.  The final quay wall peer review report was received on 27 July 2020.  The Department is considering this report, including the site investigation results, to inform a future assessment of possible design solutions and scoping options that will in themselves inform any future decision on progressing the project.<\/p> <p> Depending on the scoping option chosen, the project's cost could reach an estimated &euro;29 million.  In that light, I have allocated &euro;100,000 in the 2021 development programme to explore the potential and benefits of a deep water quay project.  Planning permission has been obtained for the project and is valid until April 2023.  Should it be necessary, a further application can be submitted.  No decision on progressing the project to work stage has been made to date.  As is the case with all developments at harbour centres, any future decision on formally initiating a project will be considered on the basis of the available funds and in light of the reports and assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200007#E00600","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620810000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, but I received the exact same answer on 29 June 2020.

We must have balanced regional development.  We must make sense of the words we use.  The recommendations in the cost-benefit analysis will not change.  Other elements might change, for example, the engineering details, but the analysis set out clearly that the \"do nothing\" option is not a good one and that a \"do something\" option, depending on which one is chosen, is essential for the area for socio-economic reasons, which are the same imperative reasons of overriding public interest for which the harbour board is looking for the matter in Galway to progress.

That is according to Mr. Kieran Wallace of KPMG in an interview with the <i>Business Post<\/i>on Sunday, 2 May.  Today, Deputies will have the opportunity to take a big step towards doing precisely that and moving workers up the chain.  The Bill seeks to change the law in two respects: by placing workers at the front of the queue when it comes to making payouts from a liquidator's pot, as is the case in Greece, France and Portugal; and by making unpaid collective agreements, for example, an unpaid collective redundancy agreement, into a debt in the eyes of the liquidation laws.<\/p><p>It is interesting that the Government has decided not to oppose the Bill.  The Debenhams strike has drawn public attention once again to the issues at stake and I suspect the Government senses that public opinion favours change.  It knows which way the wind is blowing.  However, the Government is also proposing that a Second Reading of the Bill be deferred for 12 months, meaning that it would not be allowed to progress to the next Stage until May 2022.  That is unacceptable to me as the Bill's mover and to my Solidarity-People Before Profit colleagues.<\/p><p>A retail jobs massacre is under way.  On Dublin's Henry Street, 30% of stores are vacant.  A similar situation obtains in shopping centres throughout the country.  Another large wave of closures and redundancies will arrive in the autumn, as the T&aacute;naiste pointed out in his &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; interview at the start of the week.  As a result, there is an urgent need to put in place protections for these workers in advance of the withdrawal of State supports for business.  To be clear, I am in favour of saving jobs and of campaigning to save jobs, but where saving them is not possible, full protections must be in place in terms of a decent redundancy package for working people.<\/p><p>The Government sees the urgent need to change the examinership laws for business.  It was all over the media about that issue yesterday.  As such, why does it not see the urgent need to change the liquidation laws for workers?  A clear double standard seems to be at play.  It is not as though Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are being confronted by a new issue and need some time to do some head scratching on it.  The Vita Cortex sit-in presented these matters to the parties now in government nearly ten years ago.  The Clerys scandal is six years old.  Five years ago, Ms Nessa Cahill and Mr. Kevin Duffy presented Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael with a report that the then Government had commissioned.  Five years on, the Government has failed to implement their recommendations.  As such, let us call the proposal to defer for a year by its correct name - time wasting.  Now is not the time for time wasting.  Now is the time for action and I urge the D&aacute;il to vote against the Government's amendment.<\/p><p>This legislation has been nicknamed the Debenhams Bill.<\/p> <p>The source of its inspiration is the struggle of the Debenhams workers, overwhelmingly women, which will be 400 days old this Friday.  I have been asked if the Debenhams workers can benefit directly from the passage of this Bill.  Unfortunately, the answer to that question is \"No\".  Retrospective legislation is not possible.  However, if one talks to any of the Debenhams workers, one will be told that they would be proud if the legacy of their dispute was to be improved rights for all working people in liquidation situations, for the next group of workers to whom this will happen and for the next generation.  What a generosity of spirit is shown in that attitude.  It is a generosity of spirit that should be recognised by this D&aacute;il by way of the passage of this legislation tonight without any deferral or delay.  <\/p> <p> On Tuesday morning at 4 a.m., 40 garda&iacute;, some of them from the Garda public order unit, backed up by police vans physically removed Debenhams workers from the picket line in Waterford to pave the way for scab trucks removing disputed stock.  There were more garda&iacute; there than strikers.  Similar events happened in recent weeks in Blanchardstown in Dublin, Henry Street, Dublin and Tralee, Kerry.  Why such an overwhelming show of force to remove stock that the State says is of little value?  It is because the State wants to defeat the Debenhams workers for fear that their example will encourage others, but their example will encourage others.

Either way, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should be clear that this issue is not going to go away.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200008#F00700","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620810600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I commend all of the Debenhams workers who will be watching this debate today.  They have been a shining light in the past 15 months of darkness and they have given many working people a fillip and a sense of solidarity.  It has been a horrendous 15 months for everybody in Ireland and across the globe.  Throughout summer, autumn, spring and winter, these workers stuck it out and stood together.  Throughout a global pandemic, they wintered this one out in order that they and other workers can summer anywhere.<\/p>  <p>  In years to come, the folklore of trade unionism and solidarity will look upon this strike as it did the anti-apartheid Dunnes Stores strike and the strike at the Clondalkin Paper Mill.  That is a folklore of working people who stood up against their bosses with solidarity and support for their fellow workers now and in the future.  This is a strike that challenged the concept of workers who gave their sweat and guile, that is, who gave their all, some of them for many decades, while at the same time a profitable company, Debenhams, let them down badly.  At the heart of this strike is fair redundancy for decades of service to a company.  <\/p>  <p>  The strike will come to an end, as all strikes do.  It will, probably, come to a conclusion in the next few weeks.  Each worker will want a fair settlement, but they all also want to ensure that workers will never again find themselves in the situation of having to picket for a long time, be subject to police harassment and, sometimes, be maligned in the media.  It is important to remember what this strike is about.  It is about a fair settlement for workers who have given their all in terms of service, while at the same time they have been maligned not only by Debenhams but certain parts of the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  This strike is important.  The Duffy Cahill report, like other reports in respect of which nothing has happened, has been placed on a shelf.  There is a reason nothing ever happens.  The Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties are the parties of the bosses.  They are not on the side of workers.  Regardless of what has been said by either party, they pay only lip service to workers.  If they were on the side of workers, the Duffy Cahill report would have been implemented by now and it would have prevented what has happened in the last 15 months.  That report should be implemented such that when this strike ends, the Debenhams workers will get a fair settlement for the work they have done over the last decade and this will never happen again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200009#G00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1620810600,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I think and, I hope, that when the names of taoisigh, t&aacute;naist&iacute; and Deputies who were in office over the past year have been long forgotten, the memory, inspiration and the legend of what the Debenhams workers have done over the past 15 months will still echo through the annals of working-class history.  I have no doubt people will be singing songs, reciting poems and writing plays about what these workers have done, as was done in respect of the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strikers, because they were fighting in the most inspirational and determined way for something that is right and good, but not just or themselves although that is how it began.  These people have been fighting against the shocking treatment they suffered at the hands of a company for which they had worked loyally for decades.  What is truly inspiring about the Debenhams workers is that they continue that fight even though they now know that the Government is not going to do the right thing by them and ensure that they get their two weeks statutory plus two weeks, the redundancy entitlements agreed and which they should have got.  Despite that, they carry on because they know it is important to fight for others, to make sure that what they went through is not inflicted on other workers.  That is what heroes do.  That is inspiration and that is what will be remembered long after the cowardice and inaction of the Government have been forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt but that the Government, in claiming there is nothing it can do for the Debenhams workers, is hiding its true priorities, which, always, are to ensure and protect the interests of big business ahead of the interests of working people.  No matter what the Government says to the contrary, this is clearly the case.  As stated by Deputy Barry, it is not as if this is the first time this issue has come in front of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  I refer to La Senza, Vita Cortex, Clerys and Arcadia, in respect of which, as in the case of Debenhams, there was no action.  We had promises, expressions of concern and commitments to do things in the future, but nothing done.  If one reads between the lines of many of the comments that were made in the pathetic excuses for the inaction of the Government, there is always the little whisper of \"We do not want to do anything that would deter the investors.\"  That is the truth of the matter.  It is the reason for the Government's inaction.  As with the housing crisis that we are currently facing and the cuckoo funds, lurking behind the pathetic excuses and inaction is the unwillingness to take on big business interests, to challenge them and say that justice for working people and fairness for working people should come before the hunger for profit of big business.  <\/p> <p> In the case of Debenhams and all the other examples I mentioned, we are talking about cynical, ruthless big business that is willing to just toss workers on the scrapheap regardless of the human consequences in order to guarantee its profits and interests.  However, the Government is unwilling to do anything about it.  That is shameful because who was it who generated the value in Debenhams, the reputation and the value of its brand?  Who generated the wealth of that company?  It was the workers, but they are at the bottom of the queue when it comes to actually benefiting from the liquidation of the assets.  The Government is unwilling to change that.  Even now, when it has said it will do something about the matter, it puts down a countermotion to defer the Second Reading for a year.  Why?  It is because it wants to make sure that we do not upset big business instead of just saying that Debenhams has finally shown us that we must put the workers first.  It seems this thought is unthinkable for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  They have never done it before and have no intention of doing it now.<\/p> <p> The Minister can rest assured that while this particular phase of the Debenhams dispute may be coming to an end, these workers will not give up.  It was truly inspiring to see Karen Guerin from the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike standing with the Debenhams workers outside the D&aacute;il a week or two ago.  These are the sort of heroes who actually bring about change.  It was a point James Connolly many years ago when he pointed out that it is the working people who have always brought the changes.  It has never been the people at the top who did so.  It was always working people who fought for progressive real change to benefit the majority.<\/p> <p> The Debenhams workers will undoubtedly stand in the great pantheon of workers who have fought for real change on behalf of the majority of working people in this country.  If this Bill is eventually passed or any reform is achieved, and I have no doubt it will be, it will be because of the determination, heroism and grit of those Debenhams workers.  It has been truly an inspiration to stand with these workers on the picket lines.  They are some of the most remarkable people I have ever met.  What they have done goes so far above and beyond the call of duty.  They have shown utter selflessness, particularly in the past few months when it became so clear that this Government was not willing to do anything, and bravery in the face of the outrageous behaviour we saw in Henry Street and in Waterford in the past week or so when garda&iacute;, some of whom were in paramilitary garb, were sent in to drag mostly women - mothers and grandmothers - off picket lines in order to facilitate strike breakers.  That really says it all.  The guardians of the peace are sent in by someone.  I do not know who it is.  Is it the Government or the Garda Commissioner?  They are certainly sent in to do stuff they should not be doing.  That involved facilitating the use of force against these workers who are fighting a just cause - a cause that even the Government has had to admit is just - to facilitate strike breakers taking away the stock that was workers' bargaining chip in their fight for justice.  It was truly shameful but the shameful nature of that action and the Government's inaction when it came to intervening on behalf of these workers and, indeed, changing the law to ensure it never happens again to another group of workers is not lost on the vast majority of working people.<\/p> <p> I have no doubt that the Debenhams workers will prevail in the end but it will certainly not have been with any help from this Government, which has sat idly by while they have stood on picket lines in hail, rain and snow throughout this pandemic, fighting for justice and the right cause on behalf of every worker in this country.  We know there will be more like them.  There will likely be a retail massacre, with more workers facing the injustice the Debenhams workers have faced.  At that point, the inaction and excuses of this Government will stand truly exposed.  In the end, the Debenhams workers will prevail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200009#G00300","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620811200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;That&quot; and substitute the following:  \tD&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<br \/><br \/>&mdash; acknowledges the exceptional challenges faced by many workers across Ireland as a result of the global pandemic;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; acknowledges the Government&rsquo;s commitment to further enhance the protection of employees in a way that does not unduly impede enterprises in the conduct of their business;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; resolves that the Companies (Protection of Employees&rsquo; Rights in Liquidations) Bill 2021 be deemed to be read a second time this day 12 months, to allow time for: <blockquote> \t&mdash; legislative proposals in the areas of insolvency and redundancy law;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the provision of enhanced information in relation to those remedies designed to secure the protection of employees that are already a feature of the existing legal landscape;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; legislative proposals in the area of company law that are material to the protection of workers as creditors; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the establishment of an independent forum that will consider employment law issues into the future with membership to include stakeholders such as employee and employer representatives as well as employment law and other legal experts. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>Along with many other Deputies, I offer my sincerest sympathies to the former staff of Debenhams.  It is a difficult experience for workers to lose their jobs.  It is an experience that many workers across Ireland are having at this moment as a result of the global pandemic.  I sincerely thank Deputy Barry for bringing this Bill before the House.  It is timely and affords the House the opportunity to discuss a very important issue, particularly in view of the fact that, in the programme for Government, we committed to enhancing employee rights as creditors.<\/p><p>Before we go into the detail of what is proposed in the Bill, I want to challenge the assertion that the Government has done nothing to help the workers of Debenhams.  This Government and officials in relevant Departments have engaged with the workers, Mandate and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The job loss response protocol was put in place to ensure that all available supports and information would be provided to the former workers, including welfare entitlements, job search assistance and upskilling opportunities.  This was reinitiated during the summer following my engagement with Deputy Paul McAuliffe and former Debenhams workers to ensure that no one missed out on available supports and information for workers.  The Government appointed Kevin Foley to independently review the Debenhams situation.  It is worth noting that in his independent report published in December, he stated that the 2016 collective agreement had no legal application in 2020.  The fact is that the State stepped in to provide redundancy payments - confirming that there was no money or asset there.  In recognition of the exceptional circumstances of this case, as reflected in Kevin Foley&rsquo;s report, the Government was willing to allocate a fund of &euro;3 million to be administered by SOLAS to support career guidance, training, education and pre-retirement planning for the former Debenhams workers.  This was in addition to the &euro;13 million in redundancy payments provided by the State.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Scienceand SOLAS have been engaging with Mandate over recent weeks to provide clarification on the proposed design and operation of the support.  Recently, the Labour Court provided mediation advice requesting that trade unions consider making arrangements to allow their membership consider the clarified arrangements in a second ballot.  I understand that the national shop stewards group agree that the &euro;3 million fund will be put to the former Debenhams workers for a second ballot.  I welcome that.<\/p><p>The Government has done all that it can to ensure that former Debenhams workers' legal rights and entitlements were vindicated.  Indeed it went further in this instance in recognising the significance of the situation.  This has been clearly outlined in the report by Kevin Foley published in December.  What Government did not do was unfairly build up former Debenhams workers' expectations of what could be done.  It is entirely regrettable that this happened - at the their expense - and that some exploited their situation for political gain.  It is heartening to hear Deputy Barry finally recognise on the floor of the House that no legislation could have retrospectively dealt with this situation.<\/p><p>I appreciate that Deputy Barry's intentions in the Bill are in good faith.  However, he can appreciate that putting forward proposals for additional preferential creditor status to be given to a particular class of employee - in this case collective redundancy - raises considerable complexities.<\/p> <p>First, I wish to address the purpose of the Bill, which in essence seeks to put one class of employee as preferred creditor above another in a redundancy situation, and which has the knock-on impact of creating a secondary class of employee in redundancy.  Preferential payments are provided for under section 621 of the Companies Act 2014.  A preferential creditor is one whose debts are deemed to be more important than the debts of another creditor.  As the Deputy is likely to be aware, employees are already considered preferred creditors in terms of wages owed, outstanding holiday pay, sick pay, pension scheme contributions and statutory redundancy.  Preferential debts also include rates and taxation claims and so the State is also a preferential creditor.  When a company is winding up, preferential debts rank equally.  If there are insufficient funds with which to pay all preferential creditors, that is, employees, claims are to abate in equal proportions, and in situations of insufficient funds for statutory entitlements, the State steps in via the Social Insurance Fund, which is what happened in the Debenhams case.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember the current law is a result of careful balancing of the various rights of creditors, including employees.  While preferential payments are facilitated under company law, their legislative basis and the policy underpinning them comes from other areas, such as employment and tax law.  The aforementioned section 621 refers to those relevant provisions in other legislation.  The Bill proposes to amend section 621 to provide that any redundancy payments and entitlements agreed under any contract of employment or agreement or custom and practice are included in the list of preferential payments in a winding up and provide that payments due to those employees who have been made redundant as a result of the employers' insolvency shall have priority to all other debts.  As this Bill concerns providing additional rights to employees, it is more a matter for employment rights rather than company law.  On that point, I wish to inform the House that the Government is committed to further enhancing the protection of employees in a way that, unlike this Bill, does not impede enterprises in the conduct of their business.  I will elaborate on those proposals shortly.<\/p> <p> The Bill proposes creating a special class of redundant worker in the event of the employer being insolvent with legal rights that go beyond those of workers who are made redundant generally.  To do so would represent the State picking and choosing certain workers over others as being more deserving of payments.  This would neither be fair nor proportionate.  Not all redundancies are a result of insolvency situations.  Redundancies can occur for other reasons such as an employer restructuring or downsizing, but the business will continue to trade.  Those employees would be at a distinct disadvantage if the company is not insolvent and would only be legally entitled to statutory redundancy.<\/p> <p> It is also important to remember that Ireland's system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach and collective agreements are not binding in law.  The effect of implementing this proposal would be to elevate the collective agreement to a statutory footing in insolvency situations only, with the State ultimately bearing the cost.  It should also be noted that many creditors are SMEs and microenterprises, which themselves are providing jobs.  Were the workers to be moved ahead of other priority creditors and secured creditors, there undoubtedly would be a risk to the jobs of the staff engaged in those creditor companies.  It must also be noted that in creating a special class of redundant worker, as provided by the Bill, there would be a potential impact on State creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, recouping moneys owed, which would also be a major concern and would, in turn, further deplete the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p> I wish to turn now to the Government's commitment to further enhance the protection of employees in a way that does not unduly impede enterprises in the conduct of their business.  To that end, both the Minister of State, Deputy English, and I have jointly looked at the legislative provisions that deal with redundancy and insolvency from both an employment law and a company law perspective.  We have had a number of engagements with trade union representatives.  We have set out a number of actions which combine legislative amendments in the areas of insolvency and redundancy law, as well as the provision of enhanced information on those remedies designed to secure the protection of employees that are already a feature of the existing legal landscape.  In parallel, legislative proposals in the area of company law that are material to the protection of workers as creditors are also included.  I concede that progress is slower than I would like in this area and I would like to see faster progress in the coming months.  While the amendment refers to 12 months, it is certainly not my intention that it would take that long.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the general scheme for a Bill providing for the small business administrative rescue process, which will amend the Companies Act 2014 to provide for a new dedicated rescue process for small and micro companies and, once enacted, will ensure the mechanisms are in place to protect jobs and prevent future redundancies as much as is possible.  The Company Law Review Group, CLRG, has made an initial report into the rights of employees as creditors, and we have used the opportunity of this Bill to include amendments to progress recommendations made by the CLRG regarding the provision of information to employees as creditors in a liquidation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200010#H00200","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620811800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200011#J00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1620811800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I need two more minutes or even a minute, with your indulgence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200011#J00300","speaker":"1596"},{"type":"speech","time":1620811800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will get a chance to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200011#J00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1620811800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I will not be here.

He said progress has been slow but I want to ask him how slow does he think slow is.  What I find interesting is that now that he is in government, he seems to accept the fact that since 2015 when the Clerys debacle happened, there was a recommendation from Duffy Cahill to push up the priority of workers in terms of redundancy legislation in circumstances of liquidation.  If he was on this side of the House, on the Opposition benches, he would be kicking and screaming about that, but now that he is in government he has put forward an amendment that kicks the can down the road for another year.  We already have a wait of six years and the Minister of State proposes to extend it to seven, yet he has just said that he has no intention of it taking another year.  He should amend his amendment and tell us how long it will take to change the legislation to bring workers in this country who are victims of liquidation, often tactical liquidations by companies that buy up companies that buy up companies and want to ditch the legacy of those workers, up to speed with legislation in countries like France, Portugal and Greece, to name a few countries that put workers first in those type of liquidation situations.<\/p>  <p>  That is what the Debenhams dispute has been about.  It is about justice, fairness and recognising the role of workers in all that happens in society, whether it is running a shop, a hospital, a school or the public transport service.  It is so ironic that they managed to run a strike during the entire pandemic when what was shown to everybody was that workers matter.  Their lives, jobs, efforts and labours are at the heart of everything that functions in society and the pandemic showed us that very clearly when we came to rely on the efforts of essential workers just to keep the basics of society going.  I do not think it is good enough for the Minister of State to table this amendment, to kick the can down the road and then to say to us that he does not intend it to be that slow.  If he does not intend it to be that slow, then he should tell us he is bringing his own Bill before the D&aacute;il next week, like a good Fianna F&aacute;il Opposition backbencher would have done back in the day, but now that he is in the comfortable position of being a Minister of State, he is kicking it down the road.  If it is not 12 months, then he should not put 12 months into the amendment.  It just does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a couple of points in addition to all that has been said about this dispute.  In his response, the Minister of State said he has been very good about making sure that workers knew what their welfare entitlements and supports were and that they received their statutory redundancy, but I have got news for him.  They are not entitlements that are handed down by him, by Deputy Varadkar or by anybody else, they are entitlements that are there for every citizen in the State.  The redundancy pot that is there for the statutory redundancy they were paid was funded by them.  Many of them had more than 20 years or 30 years of service and they paid their full social welfare contributions into the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p> <p>They paid for their own statutory redundancy.  It was not some gift from the gods of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to hand to them, nor was the knowledge of their welfare entitlements or the supports they are entitled to now, in the prime of their life, when they are being dumped on the scrapheap with no options other than a &euro;3 million fund to go back to school.  I have never heard anything so insulting to mothers, grandmothers, experienced workers and those who have given most of their lives working in the retail industry, making vast profits for companies, as saying \"There you are girls, go back to school.\"  It was a shameful insult.  They are voting on it and it is likely that it will be accepted, but it is only because there is nothing else for them.  The Government has done nothing for them except to tell them what they are legally entitled to, which they knew anyway.  I could have told them that, as a constituency representative of many of them.<\/p> <p> The Government should not insult them by saying it has done everything it can.  The Minister of State, his party and the Government were dragged, kicking and screaming, by those workers into even meeting them and their unions.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was dragged, kicking and screaming, because he was ashamed of what those amazing women were doing on the picket line in St. Patrick's Street in Cork.  The Government has done all it can but all that it can do is not enough.<\/p> <p> When we compare how those workers have been treated with how banks have been treated, how industry has been treated, how the bailiffs who were on their heels all the time, KPMG, have been treated by the State, it is quite shocking.  In order just to wind up Anglo Irish Bank, which brought this country to a massive collapse, the State paid KPMG &euro;175 million.  When we delve down into the role of KPMG throughout the fabric of finance and the secret world of banking and finance in this country, we find they got &euro;11 million to advise us on broadband, a fiasco that ended up costing us more than &euro;3 billion, so they got &euro;11 million for bad advice.  They also got millions from banks like AIB, which paid them &euro;50 million for auditing their books between 2002 and 2009, and the audit was so good they told none of us what was coming down the track and that there was about to be a collapse in AIB or, indeed, in the other banks they audited.<\/p> <p> There is a different set of rules for those who act as bailiffs, even for the security companies which went in during the wee hours of the morning and broke through the picket lines with the help of extraordinary protection from garda&iacute;.  They went in and they pulled women and some men out of those picket lines at a number of stores, and they did that on the basis of the protection provided by this State.  Guess what?  We were under level 5 restrictions at the time and pandemic public health rules were broken.  Ironically, given who will be talking about later and how we are going to regulate them, it was those regulated security firms and bailiffs who actually broke public health guidelines, with the collusion of State forces and with the Garda Commissioner standing over that, but nothing happened.  Fines have been issued to ordinary working-class people, particularly youths, throughout the country for breaches of public health guidelines, but nothing for these companies which broke those guidelines and used force to remove the pickets.<\/p> <p> Deputies Boyd Barrett and Barry referred to the role of workers.  The Minister of State indicated that the Government met and spoke to ICTU and Mandate.  That is fine because they are the official representatives of workers in this country.  However, when we say that nothing changes except from below, that is true.  Slavery would still be a dominant means of trading labour across the globe if the slaves themselves had not revolted.  Change always comes from below.  Women would not have the vote unless women revolted and insisted on getting the vote.  We would not have abortion rights, limited and all as they are in this State, without the big mass movement of Repeal the Eighth.  I could go on.<\/p> <p> In the case of Debenhams, we would not have had resistance that was persistent, that shone a light on the injustice to workers and that gave us all a sense of comfort and inspiration that we can actually fight back against an unjust system without the efforts of the rank-and-file workers themselves.  Regardless of who we speak to in the official trade union movement, at the end of the day, the people who matter are those men and women who are on the picket lines, the grannies, the mothers and the sisters who stuck it out through the wee hours on cold winter nights in order to make sure that they kept the one piece of armoury they had to shine a light on the injustice, namely, the stock that they protected from being taken from the stores by means of their persistent picketing.  That was done by them, not by ICTU, Mandate or anybody else.  It was done by them.  That is why the recognition of those workers is fundamentally important.<\/p> <p> The workers were dragged into the High Court by the previously mentioned KPMG, to which this State paid millions and millions.  One of them was humiliated, not in her terms, but they attempted to humiliate her in the High Court and issued threats about her behaviour.  Think of the resources that have been spent in court and on lawyers and garda&iacute; to protect a company which is imposing an injustice on these workers.<\/p> <p> I am talking to a Minister of State whose party has been in government since 2015, although the other Minister of State&rsquo;s party was not because he was in opposition.  The reason this could happen is because they have failed to legislate on the back of the Duffy Cahill report.  Those in the Government commissioned the report and got them to come out with a view on liquidations, redundancies and the preferential treatment of workers, and then did nothing.  They sat on their hands for almost six years and now we are being told they want to sit on their hands for another year.  All I can say is, \"Shame on you\".  The people of this country really need to know what they are doing.  They are kicking down the road again and again the rights of workers.  As we see more and more connived and contrived liquidations taking place in retail, and the young people everybody has been talking about in the past few days being dumped on the scrapheap of unemployment, shame on them that they are not prepared to act now.  The Government should withdraw the amendment and allow the Bill to pass Second Stage today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200011#J00800","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620812400,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly.

From what I can see, it is never the right time for this Government - like the previous Government and the one before that - to do the right thing by workers.  It is never the right time for workers' rights.  Those rights can always wait.  It is never the right time to legislate to protect workers.  That can always wait.  Other factors always have to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday we discussed the behaviour of the real estate investment trusts, entities the Government invited into this State, with tax breaks and everything else, and now look what they are doing.  Of course, it was the right time for them.  Now, all Ministers and the people who were in government with them at the time are out to defend them, saying, \"We had to do it\", \"It was a crisis situation\" and \"We absolutely needed to do it\".  When is the crisis going to hit in regard to workers?  It was a crisis situation for Debenhams.  It was a crisis situation for Clerys.  It was a crisis for the workers in TalkTalk.  It was a crisis for Vita Cortex.  It was a crisis for Paris Bakery and La Senza.  We could go on and on, yet it is never their time.  It is never the time to legislate.  Workers&rsquo; rights can always wait.  They can always be put on the long finger by this Government.<\/p>  <p>  It is shameful.  I urge the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment and to work with the Deputies on this side of the House, those who are interested in advancing workers' rights and advancing protections for workers.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great deal of talk about what we can legally hold onto and what is technical.  In fact, when agreeing a collective agreement with an employer, there is give and take.  I want to pay tribute to the workers in Debenhams because their courage, their bravery, their tenacity and their dignity in the face of what the State has thrown at them is a lesson to all of us.  When reaching a collective agreement, there is give and take.  It is never just about what the workers want and there always has to be compromise.  They compromised with their collective agreement, they compromised on their custom and practice arrangements and everything else.  Then, when push came to shove, all the compromising was on their side and the boss could make out like a bandit, and just head off into the sunset and leave them with nothing, after 30-odd years there.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how the Minister of State can stand over that.  I do not know how he can look into the faces of the mostly women workers in Debenhams and say to them, \"It is just not your time now; we will legislate at some point in future but just not now.\"<\/p> <p>I sought a remedy with the Clerys workers.  When Clerys closed the workers begged the Government at the time to do something and intervene to give them a dig-out or a hand.  What did the Government do?  It brought staff from the Department of Social Protection in to Liberty Hall.  I was never as ashamed in all my life.  They turned Liberty Hall into a dole office.  That was the best the workers were offered.  Then, when there was a clamour and cry and public outrage, there was a report.  That report has sat on a desk or shelf and God knows where it is now because no one seems interested in implementing any of its findings.<br\/><br\/>The workers were assured that some action would be taken.  They were given social welfare.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, outlined, they will have all their minimum entitlements, but they get those under the law in any event.  That is all they got.  There are nice words.  A dictionary full of nice words were spoken by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, the Fine Gael-Independent Government and from the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Government.  Governments say they would love to help but it is simply not the right time.  They will do something but not now.<br\/><br\/>Retail is facing an absolute catastrophe.  According to Mandate, we need a new deal for retail workers.  These are young workers.  They are at the business end of the failure by successive Governments to legislate to protect their interests or protect them at work.  These are vulnerable workers.  Some are heading back after this pandemic to the <i>status quo<\/i>the Government created but others will not do so.  What has the Minister of State to say to those workers?  Will he say that now is not the time or that the Government would love to talk about workers' rights but not today?  Will he say that the Government would love to protect the rights and entitlements of workers and collective agreements but not now?  When will the time come for workers' rights?  Everything seems to get kicked down the road.<br\/><br\/>I commend the Debenhams workers and the Deputies on bringing forward this legislation and thank them for providing an opportunity to discuss it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200012#K00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620813000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I too thank Deputy Barry for bringing forward this Bill and for his continued commitment to highlighting the plight of the Debenhams workers.  It is a cause close to my heart as I have supported the Debenhams workers in Newbridge on several occasions.  We were successful in repelling the efforts of the liquidator and the haulage companies that facilitated strike-breaking.  Unfortunately, the liquidator broke the agreement on level 5 restrictions to remove stock from the Newbridge store.  This was facilitated by the management of the Whitewater Shopping Centre.<\/p><p>It is six years since a liquidator was appointed to Clerys.  The Government commissioned the Duffy Cahill report in the wake of that debacle and has wasted time and money by letting this report gather dust on a shelf somewhere.  Unfortunately, the Government is no stranger to wasting taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>I will speak about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its role in this matter.  Peelian principles dictate that the Garda police by consent.  The force is risking that consent by siding with liquidators and landlords.  This week ex-Debenhams staff in Waterford were removed from an overnight blockade of the company's store after a four-hour stand-off.  The workers have a right to protest, especially against blackleg scabs who are helping the liquidators to take the bread from workers and their families.  The Garda has no place in this dispute except to keep the peace.  These protests and pickets have been peaceful, despite great provocation on the part of the liquidator.<\/p><p>We are heading towards 400 days since a liquidator was appointed to Debenhams.  In that time, it has spent multiples of the money that would have given the workers what they deserve, which is two plus two or two weeks of statutory redundancy plus two weeks for every year of employment.  Is that too much to ask for these workers, some of whom have been employed by Debenhams since the store came to Ireland in 1996?<\/p><p>I commend the Debenhams workers on their campaign, The Devil wears Debenhams.  I remind constituents that no right-thinking person could, in good conscience, buy from this company or the Debenhams brand from its new owners, <i>Boohoo.com<\/i>.  The company has trampled all over workers' rights.  This Government needs to get off the fence and implement the Duffy Cahill report.  It needs to engage with the workers to give them what they deserve.  When workers' rights are under attack we need to stand up and fight back.  Workers united will never be defeated.

The way the Debenhams workers have been treated in the past year has been absolutely outrageous.  These workers were first abandoned by their employers and then failed by the State.  We have had enough of tea and sympathy.  What they need now is action.  These workers have given years of service to the company.  They had to stand outside their former place of employment for months in the rain, hail and cold but still there is nothing.  Not only have they had to battle the elements, they literally put their lives on the line by battling through a global pandemic.  Once again, the powers that be simply do not care.  One worker told me that this impacted on all aspects of his life.  It has taken over the past year of his life and become all-consuming.  It is high time we valued workers in this State and gave them the protections they need and deserve.<\/p>  <p>  The Debenhams workers have made clear they do not want any other workers to be put in the position they have been in for the past 400 days.  They have worked hard all their lives.  We saw from the scenes of recent weeks that they are being treated like criminals.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear.  Working people have made this country.  The worst thing about all of this is that it is not new.  We have been here before and we have had this discussion and debate.  We have even had the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report, but still there is nothing.  We need to remember that this is having a real-life impact on people.  We can talk in this room and we may say this has nothing to do with us but it has a real-life impact.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the 140 people who lost their jobs in Galway had served the company for more than 30 years.  Collectively, these workers served over 300 years at the company.  After that length of time, they saw themselves as family.  I applaud them for their persistence and express solidarity with them.  They have fought hard this year and have suffered greatly.  Their legacy is that this Bill should go through.  They are standing up for all future workers and those who go through a liquidation.  That is one legacy they can be damn proud of.

We are emerging from a global pandemic.  As the economy recovers, we must take a fresh approach to workers' rights.  After decades of workers' rights being eroded by conservative governments, we need to ensure that in the 2020s workers' rights are at the forefront once and for all.<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers referred to how during the term of the previous D&aacute;il the Clerys workers were left high and dry after the company went into liquidation.  We were promised that would not happen again.  Since then, a report on the matter has been gathering dust.  Here we are in 2021 with the Debenhams workers having been on the streets for over a year protesting for basic entitlements such as redundancy and holiday pay.  It is completely unacceptable and the State has a responsibility to step in.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation and hope it passes to the next Stage.  This should only be the first step in what should be a wave of legislation to empower workers and improve workers' rights.  We need legislation that does not simply recognise the right of a worker to join a trade union but mandates or compels an employer to engage with the chosen representatives or trade union of that worker.  We need an end to the casualisation of employment.  Far more needs to be done to end the practice of bogus self-employment, which I have been looking at recently.  Some companies are avoiding payment of their fair share of PRSI while workers are being forced to go without their entitlements such as annual leave, sick pay and pension contributions.  These are basic rights that were hard-won over the decades.  There can be no place for poverty pay.  A report published yesterday showed that some people are earning less than their parents earned 30 years ago.  Prices have escalated greatly since then.  If we want workers to have security, we need to see a statutory living wage, starting at &euro;12.30 per hour.<\/p>  <p>  As we come out of Covid-19 and rebuild our economy, these are only some of the changes we need.  We must address the issue of trade union recognition.  We must address and deal once and for all with the issue of bogus self-employment.  We must put in place a living wage rather than simply a minimum wage.  Workers are entitled not only to a decent wage but not to have to live in poverty.  In this decade, labour will not and cannot wait.  Workers now need to get their fair share.  I fully back this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200013#L00400","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1620813000,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Barry on bringing this important Bill to the floor of the House.  I had one thought when I listened to some of the speakers but it was more pronounced when I listened to the reply from the Government side.<\/p> <p>If this Government was a doctor, I would be very frightened.  If I arrived into a hospital with a broken leg and my doctor was the Government, I would be told that it would look at my leg in 12 months.  That does not make sense.  I cannot believe what we are listening to.  This has been going on for years.  These are human beings.  This is about workers' rights but the Government is talking about kicking the can down the road again and having a review.  About what are we to have a review?  Hundreds of people have lost their jobs, including many whole families.  They have visited my own constituency office.  The Government will be scratching its head in a couple of weeks or months when it is probable that a tsunami of other businesses will go to the wall and it will be saying \"Jesus, we are back in the same position again.  What are we going to do?\"  It will probably just suggest another review and see if the person's other leg is broken.  That is what is coming.<\/p> <p> While speaking about the Debenhams workers, I also want to touch on all those other workers who have suffered for years.  I remember the Vita Cortex dispute in Cork.  Nothing has changed.  The Government is not learning from its mistakes.  I cannot understand why it cannot work with the people on this side of the House.  We are supposed to be here to represent the people of this country.  We are talking about workers' rights, civil liberties and people's livelihoods and families.  The Government should do the right bloody thing for once.  It should withdraw its amendment because it makes absolutely no sense.  It is an insult to the working people of this country.

I also thank and send solidarity and greetings to the former workers of Debenhams in my own area of Blanchardstown and the former workers of Debenhams stores throughout Ireland.  Over the past year, I have spoken to many workers and to the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies who have stood shoulder to shoulder with them.  All of my colleagues spoke of these workers' steadfast determination to stand and fight for justice, and not only for themselves.  The workers were talking about everyone else who was to come after them, especially those who will face redundancy in the coming months, as we know such redundancies will happen.  As sure as night follows day, there will be strikes and pickets again about the same situation, just as there were before.  Those to whom I spoke at Vinegar Hill - and other areas around the Blanchardstown Centre the workers have humorously renamed over the year - all spoke of their determination to stand up for other workers.  They knew the chances of getting what they agreed with Debenhams were slim but they all said that, if other workers did not have to go through this, that would be their victory.<\/p>  <p>  What does this Bill say?  What are the workers demanding?  They are just demanding that the redundancy payments and entitlements agreed with the companies be paid.  These payments are due to provide for the discharge of the entitlements of workers who have been made redundant.  This is a choice.  The Government must choose who to put first in line, the workers, Revenue or other creditors.  It is time to stop kicking the can down the road, which is unfortunately all that the Minister of State's amendment will achieve.  It really is that simple.  Who do we put first?  Is it the people who have worked hard, struggled and ensured that a company has stayed afloat, because nine times out of ten the workers will have taken cuts and hits long before a company closes down?  The choice is the Minister of State's.

I also thank the Debenhams workers across the country for their inspiring achievement in bringing about this Bill.  The Bill proposes that the law be changed to prioritise workers, giving them the right to be placed as a top creditor in the case of liquidations.  Most importantly, any unpaid redundancy agreements or unpaid collective agreements would be recognised as bona fide debts in law.  For too long, the injustice of workers being placed at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to payouts has been accepted and protected by law with the complicity of the State, especially in the case of strategic liquidations, with many workers getting the horrible Weetabix notification, thus named because most such employees only find out their jobs are gone when they are getting their breakfast on the way to work.  Imagine that moment.  The kids are ready to go to cr&egrave;che, school or college, the lunch is packed and Ma and Da are discussing their plans for the day when - bang - your whole world falls down around you   This must be stopped.  The scenes in Waterford in the early hours of Monday morning, when workers were forcibly removed from picket lines and corralled, must be stopped.<\/p>  <p>  This is why this Bill is so important.  We are failing the very people who created the wealth in these companies in the first place.  The first draw made in any liquidation must be for the real priority creditors, the employees.  As one Debenhams worker put it, this measure is not for them, but for their grandchild.  They did not want the same thing to happen to them.  <\/p>  <p>  I will digress a small bit and mention the strike of ESB network technicians.  I plead with the Government to use its influence, through the CEO and four members of the board of the company whom the Government appoints, to bring this dispute to an end and to recognise the mandate of the union involved.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I commend all those who brought this Bill forward.  This is simply a choice for all Deputies in this House.  They will either favour the workers or favour the existing laws that allow employees to be placed last in line when it comes to compensation or redundancy payments.  I hope they will choose the former.

Oftentimes we come in here and try to make Government the enemy.  Sometimes that is theatrics and sometimes there is a genuine reason behind it.  In this instance, the Government has absolutely no defence.  It has no defence in respect of this issue, the treatment of the Debenhams workers or the Duffy Cahill report, which, as has been said, has been sitting on an office shelf somewhere since 2015.  It is absolutely indefensible for any Minister or Minister of State to stand in this Chamber and defend the fact that the recommendations of the Duffy-Cahill report still have not been implemented.  It is absolutely inevitable that we will be back here again and again.  As a result of the nature of the pandemic and the capitalist society in which we operate, companies will utilise this pandemic to force through redundancies.  To deal with this on a case-by-case basis is to fundamentally fail the workers.  The Minister of State can list the individual things the Government has done for the Debenhams workers, but to do so is to completely miss the point.<\/p>  <p>  Last November, Neasa Cahill and Kevin Duffy appeared before an Oireachtas committee.  They said that company law did not need to be amended in order to implement the recommendations of their report.  What did Government do in December?  It asked the Company Law Review Group to review any company law that may need to be amended, despite the evidence that those who wrote the report gave to an Oireachtas committee.  Now the Minister of State comes in here and insults the lot of us with a year-long delay to this Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  Every time we bring up issues of workers' rights, we are insulted by the Government.  We were accused of virtue signalling when we brought in legislation on sectoral pay agreements.  It was the same when we brought in a motion on youth unemployment and when we spoke about the lack of sick pay during a pandemic.  What did the Government do?  It said we will talk about it in six months' time.  As we quite rightly said, no other sector of Irish society would have to wait so long - for six years - for the implementation of a report that does not go as far as this legislation.  This is a reasonable report written by reasonable people which aims to prevent the very issue we are talking about today.  In my own constituency, there are two instances of redundancies in Baldoyle affecting a total of 540 workers.  How many more will there be over the coming months and years?  Somebody in the Minister of State's position will trot in here and say that it is a difficult situation but that one must understand company law and that all of these individual circumstances are different.  This will be said even though the Government has had a report since 2015 that would ensure that, in such circumstances, workers would not have to spend 400 days protesting to stand up for their rights.  The Government has absolutely no defence.<\/p>  <p>We in the Labour Party pay tribute to the Debenhams workers and other workers who, over many years, have taken a stand in this regard.  We are sick, tired and sore of being forced to go down to picket lines with workers who should be sorted out at the start.<\/p> <p> There is no glory or honour from a Government point of view in saying it has respect for Debenhams workers or whatever other band of workers there may be in the future.  The Government has the capacity and ability to sort this out now, so that other workers do not have to go through the same heartbreak in the future.  What is the point of politics or legislative processes?  What is the point of the over and back in this Chamber or of commissioning a report?  What is the point in telling us that it will take one year or asking the Company Law Review Group to do its work when the Government does not do anything about a review for six years?  It is absolutely indefensible.  The Government has no defence.<\/p> <p> Once again, I and Deputies from other political parties will say the very same thing and we will get another response from another Minister or Minister of State who will say \"Well, you know, we will have a look.\"  As has been correctly said, we will hopefully get a resolution to the Debenhams issue.  The Minister cannot come in here in some months' time when this inevitably happens again and say, with a straight face, that this is a particular situation, as the T&aacute;naiste is so well-practised in doing.<\/p> <p> In any other aspect of public life or public policy, legislation can be rammed through in jig-time.  This is why people sometimes lose faith in politics, Departments and Ministers.  The Government asked the workers to put faith in the review and report and to trust the process, which the Clerys workers also did at one point, but six years after the report has been done, there is nothing.<\/p> <p> I suggest that the Minister come to the House next week.  We will all forfeit whatever time is necessary for the Minister to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report so that we are not back here in a number of months' time dealing with what I fear will be an inevitable cascade of redundancies, for which companies will no doubt use the pandemic as cover.  There are 540 such redundancies already in Baldoyle.  If this was happening in Ballyhaunis, we would all hear about it.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to do his work.  The Debenhams workers have done their work, having spent 400 days on the picket.  None of us wants to see another band of workers go through the same thing.  Six years is not good enough.  I suggest that the Government do what it was asked to do six years ago by implementing the recommendations of the report.  Do not insult the authors of the report by completely contradicting them only one month after they come before an Oireachtas committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200014#M00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620814200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry for bringing the Bill forward.  It is most important and timely.  I acknowledge and pay respect to the former workers of Debenhams who, for 400 days, have demonstrated immense dignity, respect and determination.  It is a testament to who they are as people in contrast to the indifference shown to them by the State.<\/p>  <p>  We have spoken about the Debenhams workers many times in the D&aacute;il and then failed to act.  In July 2020, which was nearly 100 days into the strike, most of us here spoke on this same issue, thanks to a motion introduced by Deputies Barry, Boyd Barrett and Gino Kenny.  Even then, 100 days was too long for those workers to be standing on a picket line.  I remember that 100 days was a symbolic date at the time.  Women, men and younger workers from Debenhams had been picketing for 100 days.  We all said that was simply too long and that the Government needed to act.  The Government told us the workers needed to wait, we did not understand, the issue was complex, something was coming down the line, we were being naive and somehow, by virtue of its own arrogance, the Government was correct.  Now, 400 days along the line, things have changed but for the worse for the workers on the picket lines.<\/p>  <p>  This discussion of the Companies (Protection of Employees&rsquo; Rights in Liquidations) Bill 2021, introduced by Deputy Barry, marks nearly 400 days of strike action by the Debenhams workers.  During the pandemic, we were told we are all in this together.  There were high levels of solidarity, pandemic unemployment payments were introduced which were commensurate with people's dignity and sense of togetherness.  We invested in public services.  It really did seem that we were all in this together.  In July 2020, the tactical liquidation forced on the Debenhams workers proved that to be untrue.  With each passing day of indifference since then, the workers had to stand on picket lines up to the point they were forcibly removed.  The Government's continuing indifference has demonstrated that we were not all in this together, some of us were viewed as lesser and the plight of some workers was considered less significant.  The facade of solidarity and goodwill has fallen.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week, the Garda mobilised in greater numbers than the number of workers on the picket line in Waterford.  Garda&iacute; used physical force and intimidation against these workers.  Let us remember who these workers are.  They are, in the main, women.  Many are older and have devoted years of their working lives to Debenhams and, previously, Roches Stores.  I have heard it said, including in the context of the debate after 100 days of pickets, that Debenhams is an institution and this is one of the reasons so much public attention had been placed on the plight of these workers.  I rejected that fully then and will now.  Debenhams was never an institution.  Nobody particularly cares about the company but people do care about the values the workers represented and the smiles with which they greeted customers.  The values and virtues of those working class people, who went in to work every day, contributed their labour, valued their work and provided a service, are what made that building an institution.  It is they who have been left behind while the Debenhams shareholders were placed forward.<\/p>  <p>  Weeks ago, in my constituency of Dublin Central, the Garda acted in much the same way as it did in Waterford last week.  The footage and images from outside Debenhams on Henry Street and Parnell Street are very difficult to watch but I believe it is a truer reflection of how the State feels when it comes to workers' rights than any of the promises and words made by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  My mind wandered to what was happening in the operation rooms where senior members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were giving orders to younger, less senior members of the Garda who are often underpaid and overworked and conveying them that they must remove other workers.  That is a sad reflection of the State.  These are images we should not have to see.  Workers who are underpaid should not have to remove the one tactical advantage that workers on strikes and picket lines have when trying to stop stock from being removed.  It was the only card the Debenhams workers had to play.  This is a sad reflection of what ten years of Fine Gael ideology has done to this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government wants us to believe the narrative that there is only so much it can do and its hands are tied.  In truth, it has chosen to treat these workers, and many like them before, in this way.  Government after Government has made the choice not to protect workers.  A choice is made when the Government fails to implement recommendations from the Duffy Cahill report.  It is a choice when the T&aacute;naiste says he cannot ban KPMG from removing stock.  It was a choice not to change the law after the Vita Cortex, Clerys and Thomas Cook closures and it will be a choice if we fail to do anything after this.  It was a choice to allow workers to stand on a picket line for 400 days until it was convenient to remove them forcibly.  It is a choice when the Government uses indifference over action.  We were not elected to be bystanders or to turn a blind eye.  We have done more to protect the stock in Debenhams stores than we have done to protect the Debenhams workers.  More value has been placed on stock than on workers.<\/p>  <p>  The ESRI publication on minimum wage policy last year stated that data from 2017 to 2019 showed that 8% of all employees in Ireland were on the minimum wage.<\/p> <p>When looked at by sector, 20% of all employees in retail were in receipt of the minimum wage.  These are the same retail workers who have been absolutely invaluable since the start of the pandemic.  Many of us already recognise them as essential workers.  Their contribution meant they were the ones who remained at work and became another front line when everyone else had to stay at home.  How many of the liquidators who are forcing these closures, removing stock and somehow backchanneling with the State in order to forcibly remove workers from picket lines are also on minimum wage?  Very few.  <\/p> <p> It is completely transparent whose interest the Government chooses to protect and prioritise.  This Bill seeks to put workers at the centre rather than the back of queue when it comes to payments from a liquidator by transforming unpaid collective redundancy agreements into unpaid debts in the eyes of liquidation law.  While the Bill is inspired by the resilience and force of the Debenhams workers, to whom I pay tribute and with whom I will stand later today outside the gates of Leinster House, we need to remember this is for all workers, past and future.  Every political party across the left has stated that this will not be the last time we will be in the House talking about tactical insolvencies.<\/p> <p> Debenhams workers are fighting on behalf of their children and grandchildren in order to protect them.  They have put the issue of workers' rights back on the agenda.  How the Government chooses to act will not be forgotten by Debenhams workers and the many workers like them.  It is now very clear there is a line in Irish politics.  It is between those political parties which have chosen to watch all those workers from Debenhams, Vita Cortex and Clerys who have been left behind by the State, that is, the parties which have acquiesced, done nothing and left the Duffy Cahill report on the shelf for six years, and those other parties which have made the choice to want and be willing to act.  That is the choice the same old politics has to reckon with.  If political parties do not act that is fine, but they will be replaced.  That is the challenge for those of us bringing forth, proposing and supporting this legislation.  It is to act now or be replaced because the line is becoming very clear. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200015#N00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620814800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>From Clerys to Debenhams, when a company goes into liquidation ordinary workers lose out.  Unfortunately, nothing has changed since the closure of Clerys.  Successive governments have failed to implement reforms or protections in the liquidation process to ensure that workers get what they are entitled to.  I have seen much debate in Leinster House and an enormous amount of lip service paid to the workers of this country, but I have not yet seen the introduction of the necessary laws to protect their entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, we saw the historic Clerys department store on O'Connell Street close for good, resulting in the loss of 450 jobs and livelihoods.  At that time, we saw a tactical insolvency where an individual company came in and created a corporate veil between itself and its responsibilities to workers, concession holders and the State.  We saw a situation where the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government at the time, carried out the Duffy Cahill report but refused to act upon it.  As a result, we saw a cost to the State of &euro;2.5 million in redundancy payments to those workers.  Where is that money and the millions of other euro of taxpayers' money spent on redundances, which the State had to take care of as a result of companies not paying their fair share and not doing what they were responsible for?<\/p>  <p>  At the time, I saw platitudes by the Fine Gael-Labour Government whose members talked about how terrible this was.  I debated the issue then and I remember bringing about legislation which sought to pierce the corporate veil at the time.  That legislation was refused by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I do not know if anybody else saw it, but I just witnessed a fine demonstration by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on how particular political parties, when in government, ignore the needs of workers in this country.  At the time, in 2015, I distinctly remember trying to convince the Labour Party Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, of the necessity of passing laws regarding the corporate veil.  I saw that political party get rid of the Sunday premium, which had the effect of reducing the wages of about 200,000 low-paid workers.  If anybody juxtaposes those actions from the Labour Party when it was in government with the fine performance we saw from Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in just a couple of minutes ago, it will show the breathtaking neck of political representatives in this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Today, we saw the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, again offer tea and sympathy to the hundreds of workers in this country who, year after year, get stuffed by the legislation that is in place.  Again, he refused, when in power, to carry out the necessary actions that would actually help these individuals.  That again stands in stark contrast with the words of Fianna F&aacute;il when it was in opposition.  When it was in opposition, Fianna F&aacute;il backed a Bill I was involved in creating, similar to this Bill, which would have meant workers were prioritised with regard to their status when it came to redundancy.  Fianna F&aacute;il is a different political party in opposition compared to when it is in government.  That is what is wrong with the political establishment in this country.  Politicians will put their arms around people at the gates of Leinster House, will give them tea and sympathy all they like but, unfortunately, the establishment political parties in this country will not stand up when they have the power to do something in government.  It is heartbreaking to see. <\/p>  <p>  This issue needs to be resolved now.  It is one of many issues that has led to a serious divide in Irish society.  One of the biggest problems that exists currently on the planet, and in this country, is the increasing divide between the wealthy and the rest of the population.  According to Oxfam, 62 people in the world own as much wealth as half its population.  In Ireland, that gap between rich and poor is increasing all the time.  It is reckoned that the middle 60% of the population is seeing its wealth decrease year on year to about 45% of the average wealth of the country.  The over-concentration of wealth in the hands of the few is one of the biggest problems that exists.  It robs billions of people of the necessities of life with regard to decent food, water, education and healthcare but it is also one of the most destabilising elements of modern society.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt in my mind that a number of elements have led to that divide between rich and poor and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few.  Taxation injustice is one of its biggest drivers but the way in which legislation governs work in this country is another.  The proliferation of bogus self-employment is an incredible element within Irish society.  Governments have talked about it for years but have done precious little about it.  It is estimated that at least 20,000 subcontractors in the construction industry are in bogus self-employment in Ireland and that number may well be higher.  That does two things.  It allows certain employers not pay their fair share when it comes to taxation, it robs workers of their protections and entitlements as regards work, and it creates poverty in those working groups within the State.  Workers should be employed directly.  They should receive legal entitlements for the fruits of their labour.  Bogus self-employment forces workers into subcontracting and allows some contractors shirk those responsibilities.  <\/p>  <p>  It is now imperative that these issues are addressed.  The economic situation over the next number of years will worsen.  That is a shocking truth being ignored by many of the establishment parties in this country.  There will be major difficulties in the economy over the next number of years.  A large number of retailers, both small and large, will not be able to deal with the changes within the economic environment that currently exists.  We will see situations like Debenhams arise again and again.  Are we simply going to have the same debate in Leinster House, or in this building which costs the taxpayer &euro;20,000 a day to run, or will we put a full stop to this type of behaviour in order that workers have something to fall back on if they lose their jobs?  We have a situation where unemployment currently stands at 25%.  Youth employment currently stands at 60%.  The national debt has jumped &euro;40 billion since the pandemic started and thousands of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, have closed their doors for good in this State.<\/p> <p>It is beyond time and imperative that we try to economically recover from the pandemic and the Government-imposed lockdowns and restrictions but that we put in place the necessary rights and legislation for workers to provide that when their employment ends, they have something to fall back on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200016#O00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620815400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I sincerely thank Deputy Barry for bringing this very much needed Bill before the D&aacute;il, the content of which is \"to provide for preferential creditor status to employees in collective redundancy situations; to provide for recognition of a redundancy payments in a winding up; and to provide for related matters\".  What we saw happening in the case of the Debenhams workers was a disgrace.  This week it will be 400 days since their campaign began.  The way their case culminated and finished was a disgrace.  For instance, in County Kerry, these hardworking, genuine people were forcibly taken from their place of peaceful protest after all of the days and nights they spent there.  I have met them late at night in the cold, the damp and the rain and have heard at first hand about their position.  I remind Members that the Debenhams workers were predominantly ladies who were owed &euro;5,000, &euro;7,000 or up to &euro;20,000 of their own money.  It is not the company's money, it is their money that they are owed.  They were extremely respectful and peaceful in their protest but they would have the right to be very angry.  If any person owed that much money to another individual, it would be a criminal matter and it is appalling those people were treated in that way.  The boat has now sailed for that group of people.  The Debenhams workers have an interest in this area and it is very good of them to be concerned about the rights of future workers.  We need to ensure we or other politicians will not at some future date be discussing other workers who have badly wronged.  I want to remember those people today and the vast amounts of money involved.  It was their money for which they worked damned hard but never got.  It is a disgrace.

It is galling to think that this company, which has all those assets and has been selling them and moving them from one place to another, has not been brought to book for it.  It just shows there is a law in the country for some but not for others.  I understand the company will now operate online and it has got to keep all the goods it had.  That is very unfair and unjust on those workers.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement had and has a role to play in situations like this.  We had other liquidations in County Kerry where small private employers of small and medium enterprises were caught out by bigger companies and those companies are back in action again, having left many people, including myself, without the money we earned and for which we work hard.  They are in competition again and working away as good as ever.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has a lot to answer.

If implemented, the legislation aims to place workers at the head of the queue when it comes to payments from a liquidator and it would make an unpaid collective redundancy agreement into an unpaid debt in the eyes of the liquidation laws.  The year-long struggle of the Debenhams workers has acted as an inspiration for this Bill.  The Debenhams dispute highlighted the cold cruelty of the liquidation laws to workers.  A spokesperson for former Debenhams workers on Patrick Street, Valerie Conlon, said they fully supported the Bill.  Two weeks ago a story emerged that members of the Garda had forcibly removed Debenhams workers from the picket line in Dublin.  In doing so, the Garda's actions allowed the receiver, KPMG to break the protest and remove stock from the premises in the middle of the night.  That happened at Henry Street.  I cannot understand why this State has stood idly by as these Debenhams workers have been treated in an appalling manner.  Many of these workers are from west Cork but no matter where they are from, they deserve to be treated like human beings and in a more respectful manner, but, as I said, the State has stood idly by.<\/p>  <p>  The protection of workers' rights is a major issue in the workplace for the employer and the employee.  In fairness, nearly all employers are compliant but for the odd rogue trader, which will exploit every loophole in the law to carry out these shoddy deals.  As for the protection of workers' rights, those employed through work schemes with community and voluntary groups should have their rights strongly protected, as some get shoddily treated.  Just because they are in receipt of a low income does not give anyone the right to exploit their circumstances.  Again, 99% of community and voluntary groups are compliant but there is always the odd chancer.  As I come from the community and voluntary sector, it is only right that I raise this issue.  I have raised with the Minister on several occasions the need to save the Cara Lodge centre in Ahiohill in west Cork with respect to the services it was providing for the people of west Cork.  The workers were shockingly treated by the HSE and are still awaiting redundancy after been booted out of their jobs, which is a scandal.  I also would like to raise the issue of the community employed workers aged from 55 to 65 who are also being shoddily treated and who face being let go after the pandemic.  That must be examined also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200017#P00500","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1620815400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Is history repeating itself?

I will be voting for it.  It is a simple, straightforward Bill putting redundant workers top of the list of creditors in the case of insolvency and it represents an important step forward.  Earlier in the course of this dispute, I moved a Private Members' motion calling for legislation to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report.  That report was commissioned by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, following the technical insolvency at Clerys in Dublin.  The implementation of that report would have made it much more difficult for companies to engage in technical insolvencies.  It would have avoided the situation in which the former Debenhams workers find themselves in. The previous Government promised yet another review, the same tactics used to avoid taking action on the Duffy Cahill report and now with the Government's amendment, it continues to try to drag out and kick the can down the road for another 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  This week will mark 400 days of struggle by the Debenhams workers. <\/p> <p>It is a tremendous symbol of their courage and their solidarity with each other and with other retail workers who may face the same difficulties as they have.  They know that legislation is too late for them but they have expressed again and again their determination to achieve change for workers in the future.  I salute them for that.  They have been treated abysmally over the last 400 days due to strike-breaking by the liquidators, KPMG, with the support of the Garda and the courts.  Debenhams has been able to take hold of its stock.  KPMG will receive a generous fee as the liquidator.  The workers are now in a situation where they have to consider their position and will probably vote to reluctantly accept the offer of a &euro;3 million retraining or back to school fund.  They will not get their due under the agreement that Debenhams made with their union, for which they made considerable concessions about their working conditions.<\/p> <p> Yesterday morning, I took part in a Zoom meeting in which the Debenhams shop stewards in Waterford explained that in the early hours of Tuesday morning, pickets found themselves facing six vanloads of garda&iacute;, including members of the public order unit.  At least on this occasion they did not seem to suffer the heavy-handed and, to put it bluntly, violent action taken by garda&iacute; at the picket on Henry Street in Dublin.  Recently the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, who has responsibility for this area, spoke about the role of essential workers in the coronavirus crisis and recognised that many of these workers are low paid and have limited rights such as the right to sick pay.  I would go further.  The capitalist society that the Minister of State so admires cannot function at any time without the labour of working people.  Having said that, I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's words on workers' rights.  I genuinely hope they are sincere and well meant and will be translated into action.<\/p> <p> I am supporting this Bill.  Implementing the Duffy Cahill report would be a good start.  The ball is in the Government and Minister's court.  Please do not kick it into the long grass again.  That has been disgraceful.

It is a short Bill to amend the Companies Act 2014 and will make provision for recognition of redundancy payments that are agreed in relevant collective agreements in a winding-up of a company.  The Bill also gives preferential creditor status to employees in a winding-up of a company.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is informally referred to as the Debenhams Bill in recognition of the outstanding perseverance of Debenhams workers who have been on the picket line for almost 400 days.  These workers, mainly women, were blocking the removal of stock from closed premises, asking that their previously negotiated redundancy packages be adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  Most Members will have seen an email sent to us earlier this week from Ms Carol Quinn.  Carol told us that she worked in Debenhams in the Square in Tallaght for 30 years.  Despite this length of service, she was made redundant in March 2020 via a generic email.  Carol said \"it was not a very nice experience\" and told us that she had been the shop steward at this store for over 15 years.  I say \"length of service\" because it is a service.  People working in retail have to deal with customers, management, stock control and many other aspects of working in that sector.  When employees are on their feet for long periods and have to show courtesy in the face of sometimes rude customers.  It is a multifaceted and multi-skilled role.  During the pandemic, retail employees have been front-line staff and should be recognised as such.<\/p>  <p>  The wonderful trade union spirit can be felt in Carol&rsquo;s email.  She stated, \"My aim at 62 is for my children and my grandkids to get better working conditions, especially in low-paid retail jobs.\"  That is what trade union membership and industrial action are all about.  We are thinking about the future of jobs and the employees coming up the ranks behind us.  I hope that Covid has renewed the sense of solidarity and power in unions because we have seen a move towards individualism over many years.  People are tending not to join or support unions because their own personal situation is okay or because of the increase in zero-hour contracts, precarious employment and the so-called gig economy.  If only our political system could support workers as much as it does those involved in it, it would make some difference.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, Deputy Mick Barry and his staff hosted a briefing with some of the Debenhams workers from the Waterford, Cork and Henry Street stores and elected representatives.  Michelle had not had much sleep after trying to stop the removal of stock from the Waterford store on Monday night.  She told us that about 40 garda&iacute; in six Garda vans were deployed to the store, half of whom were apparently from the public order unit.  The Garda has been involved in allowing KPMG to recover stock from Debenhams premises.<\/p>  <p>  It is obvious that there are classist, gendered aspects to this industrial dispute, and a lack of widespread public support.  The majority of Debenhams workers are women.  Many of them were working there when it was Roches Stores.  They have given their working lives to the retail outlet only to be shafted at the last hurdle.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of the women on the picket lines has been despicable.  We have seen images of women in their 50s and 60s and some men in their 70s being roughly handled by garda&iacute;, most severely in the recent protests at the Henry Street branch.  Why are garda&iacute; being used to break up the pickets?  Surely sending in packers to gather the stock went against level 5 Covid restrictions?  I do not see much comment from the Government about that.  The T&aacute;naiste is great at shedding crocodile tears in the media about workers' rights but has not explained why the Garda is policing stock during a pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  This is not the first time this issue has been brought to the D&aacute;il.  We heard about Vita Cortex, Clerys and Arcadia before Debenhams.  The Duffy Cahill report has been gathering dust for about six years now.  If its recommendations had been implemented, this situation could have been avoided.  I offer my full solidarity to all the Debenhams workers, to Jane, Michelle, Suzanne, Carol, Carol Ann, and all of the others.  The Government has let them down, but they have done themselves proud.

I have listened to the speeches and, like everybody else here, I sympathise with the workers in Debenhams and other workers facing redundancy in other situations because workers are the big losers in a redundancy.  They lose their jobs, their careers of 20 or 30 years, their families are affected and there is an immense knock-on effect.  We can have nothing but sympathy for people who are made redundant.  That is why all of us have debated this matter on many occasions and tried to find solutions to prevent redundancies in future and to work with those who are made redundant to find new opportunities.  That is ongoing work that we all engage in.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important that we have an honest conversation about this because the conversation from many of the speakers has been dishonest.  That has not helped all those in Debenhams who have worked and campaigned hard for their rights and for changes to put a better system in place for their children and grandchildren.  I agreed, as did the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach, that we would work with them to do that.  The conversation in this debate has repeatedly been about the Duffy Cahill report that was produced about Clerys, how it would solve all this and stop redundancies and how it would have prevented the issue with Debenhams.  That is not true and it is not fair to keep saying that.  The authors of the report have attended a meeting of the joint committee.  We have teased through all of this.  I have attended the committee and we went through all the recommendations for changes.  The authors stated that their report would not have prevented the issues with Debenhams because it and Clerys are two different situations.  None of us likes what happened in those cases or in many other situations that resulted in redundancies, but they are different and it is wrong, untrue and dishonest to keep linking the two cases.  I have asked Deputies if they have any evidence to prove such a link or that would assist me, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste or the courts in our work, concerning so-called assets and a big pot of gold that we are told Debenhams has.  They should come to me or the authorities.  That has not happened either in public or in private.  None of those who keep saying that in the House has done that.  If there is a link and there are assets, please identify them and we can have the matter dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  Despite what has been said, there is legislation in place that provides protection in such situations.  I will be happy to engage with any Member who can genuinely show me the connection or the assets that are supposedly hidden away or some place else that would help the workers of Debenhams.  Who would not want to help them?  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and many others have repeatedly said that we will work with everybody to strengthen the position in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and many others have repeatedly said we will work with everybody to strengthen the situation and try to find any resources we could within the legal system to help those who were made redundant in Debenhams.  <\/p> <p> The Bill enhances the conversation we are having here.  There are two things in it.  We have asked for a timed amendment.  We have been working on this for the last months, probably since last July, since I sat down with the T&aacute;naiste, Mandate and some of the workers who have been referred to here from Debenhams.  We gave a commitment to review all the legislation, the Duffy Cahill report and all the other legislation to see if we can strengthen the position of people who are left in the situation, if we can make it better for them and strengthen company law to prevent companies such as Clerys who did that.  That was not the case with Debenhams, or it is unproven.  The people who say it is should bring forward the evidence.  We have committed to doing that.  We gave our word that we would do that.  Those employees said to me that they had two parts to their campaign, first, to get their entitlements that they really felt strongly about and which they absolutely have the right to campaign for, and, second, to strengthen the legislation to give greater protection to workers.  We are all for that and are happy to engage on that.<\/p> <p> That is the work we have been doing for the last couple of months.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, said earlier, yes we wish we had got that work finished quicker but it is now complete.  We are in the process of writing to all the social partners and unions involved to tease through the suggested actions from our side.  I committed to going back to the committee to tease them through.  I am very happy to engage and work with anyone in this House around our proposed actions and recommendations which we believe will strengthen and assist the case.  That is not to say that the Duffy Cahill report was the answer to everything because that is not the case and the authors themselves have said that.  The report was written specifically about Clerys.  It is not that it sat on anyone's shelf or gathered dust.  It was reviewed in 2017 by the various Departments and the decision was made not to proceed with it.  We committed to looking at it again, and everything else, to see if we can help and that is what we have done.  There are changes that we will bring forward in legislation.  It will not take a year to do that.  We asked for a year, a timed amendment, for all this to be completed but that process is very far on and we can move to legislative proposals straight away.  We will engage with the committee on its own report on this issue, and with former Debenhams workers and everyone else to do it.  It will not take 12 months but that is the timed amendment, because traditionally one asks for six or 12 months, to make sure we can get all this done.  My commitment here is that it will be done.  <\/p> <p> There is another part where we disagree with the Bill, or more accurately a conversation has to be had.  The Deputy talks about prioritising workers' rights.  All the speeches here gave the impression that is not in place already, but it is.  Workers' statutory entitlements are protected.  The chair of the Labour Court has said this, so have the courts.  We have paid out the money because they are prioritised in a redundancy situation, they are preferred creditors, but beyond that -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200018#Q00300","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1620816600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1620816600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>Sorry, I did not interrupt anyone else.  Beyond that, we stand behind that with statutory payments and we pay out.  In the Debenhams case, &euro;13 million has been paid out for all their entitlements.  I know it does not completely deal with their further collective entitlements but on the statutory rights around holiday pay, workers pay, time in lieu it is all there, whatever their entitlements are, it is dealt with.  Wages and salaries of employees are protected, holiday pay owed to employees and compensation and damages for uninsured accidents is also a priority.  Sick and superannuation payments are all paid out.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection did get involved straight away and over &euro;13 million has been processed and paid out.<\/p>  <p>  The conversation is around enhanced agreements in companies.  They happen regularly in many companies but there are arrangements between individual companies and individual employees.  They are not statutorily recognised as yet.

The concern is that nobody knows where that might end up because they are voluntary agreements between companies and their employees and they could agree any terms of employment.  The taxpayer and the State for decades have recognised statutory entitlements and payouts and do protect employees.  The conversation this morning gives the impression that they do not.  If one wants to extend that statutory payments conversation, that is the one we should have and I am all for it.  It is now about 20 years since an agreement was reached around the two weeks payout per year for redundancy, so yes let us have a conversation around that to see do we or should we collectively agree to enhance that or not.  It would be timely to do that after 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am not sure that the argument that we should recognise and pay out on all voluntary agreements is equal or fair on the taxpayer or anyone else who is owed money from a company in liquidation.  We are happy to engage.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and ourselves have teased this out here at committee and everywhere else.  We are bringing forward changes that reflect the overall review of this area which we believe go some way to strengthening the legislation, certainly to make people's options and entitlements more clear because I must say again they have been given wrong information.  There has been a dishonest conversation around Debenhams from the very start which has been unfair to the workers.  It was not the unions that did that, it was others.  That has not helped anybody.  I sat with them and went through this with the workers.  I have told them that we will do our part, we will strengthen the legislation which we will and that is happening now.<\/p>  <p>  People said it was an insult to offer &euro;3 million.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and all our labour organisations and statutory authorities, including the chairman of the Labour Court, Kevin Foley, worked and engaged on this to see how we could stretch the involvement of Government and stretch the law as far as we possibly could do to find additional resources to assist.  An extra &euro;3 million was found to assist these workers with their future career plans, retraining, moving to a new career, adapting to technology, and an enhanced system of training, career guidance and engagement.  That is something that happened in many other cases such as Dell in Limerick years ago, funded through a European globalisation fund.  The State said we could assist.  We could not, under the law, assist with the other payments which were a voluntary agreement.<\/p>  <p>  It is wrong to continually come in here and say that Duffy Cahill would have prevented all this.  I would ask anybody, including all those who spoke here for five minutes and left, to read through all the committee debates on this, read through the reports and listen to its authors who have never claimed that.  Everyone believes themselves to be an authority on what that report says, but not its authors.  The report has assisted us in our thinking and we have engaged with all our social partners and beyond this week to move on our recommendations and actions which will assist here.  That is a commitment and honours the commitment in the programme for Government and the commitment given to Mandate and the Debenhams workers at our Department meeting as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200019#R00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1620816600,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Thirteen months of heroic struggle from the Debenhams workers met with 13 months of excuses, excuses and more excuses from the Government.  I congratulate the Minister of State.  He managed to sum up the Government's response over more than a year in his ten minute speech which started \"Of course I sympathise with the workers\" - you cannot have anything but sympathy with the workers - but then went on to say that the workers' rights and entitlements are already protected in law, implicitly asking what on earth we are doing here and what on earth the Debenhams workers have been doing on a picket line for 13 months.  He went on to accept that in law they are not protected, their first two are protected in redundancy payments but the plus two is very clearly not protected.  The Minister of State then suggested we could have a conversation about that when we have a very good Bill before the House today that could proceed to Second Stage.  If the Government has particular proposals, we could amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  However, instead the Minister of State wants to have a conversation about it, that is, he does not want to talk about it at all but kick it to touch.  He then had the temerity to say that there has been dishonesty around this conversation.  There certainly has been dishonesty around this, and cynical politicking by the establishment parties around this issue.  There is no question about that, because we have had a Government offer nothing but sympathy and excuses for over a year.<\/p>  <p>  There is something deeply ironic about the arguments the Government is deploying today because for 13 months the workers were told, and we were told, that nothing can be done.  The very fact that the training fund offer has been made demonstrates that something could have been done, something still can be done, and a different offer could have been made.  That is obvious to anybody.  Effectively, the Government's argument was retrospection.  One cannot do anything backward, one cannot go back and fix this situation.  Okay, let us take that at face value.  We have here today a proposal that is not retrospective but prospective.<\/p> <p>It is a proposal to ensure that no other groups of workers are treated like the Debenhams workers.  That is what it is.  The excuse that the Government has had for more than a year no longer holds any water.  What does the Government say now?  All of a sudden, it is not in favour of dealing with it prospectively either but is instead in favour of kicking it down the line.  In reality, it is in favour of the problem going away.<\/p> <p> Reference has been made to La Senza, Vita Cortex, Clerys and many other examples of workers who have faced a similar situation.  A Deputy earlier made the point that the Government does not seem to learn from its mistakes.  If a mistake happens over and over again, and the mistake always seems to benefit big business at the expense of workers, perhaps it is time to ask whether it is a mistake at all.  Is it an accident that Government policy proceeds to protect, defend and take the side of big businesses that screw over workers, as opposed to those workers who were thrown on the scrapheap?<\/p> <p> This Bill would place workers first in future liquidations.  We have had 13 months of Government Deputies and Ministers, some of whom have visited picket lines, shedding tears about the former Debenhams workers.  Now is the time when they get the chance to put their money where their mouth is.  If they do that, they will reject the Government's proposal to kick the issue down the road and delay the Bill for another 12 months, and would instead pass this legislation today.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to the Debenhams workers for the heroic chapter they have written in Irish and labour history.  It will continue to serve as an inspiring example to other groups of workers who, unfortunately, will be faced with the same situation in the coming months and years as the Government lets these companies away with it.  It has shown workers they can struggle and fight back.  However, through that struggle, they have also shone a light on many truths about our society.  One of those truths is the nature of the State we have and in whose interests it operates.  Nothing made that clearer than when members of the Garda went in heavy-handed and attacked former Debenhams workers on the picket line.  The workers and their supporters were manhandled and dragged out, thrown around and onto the ground, in order to break their picket lines.  On Monday, 40 garda&iacute; and six police vans were used to break up a peaceful picket and to support scab trucks taking stock out of the Waterford shop.  If we had a police force that was genuinely designed to protect the interests of all, the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, would be resigning because of the Garda's facilitation of illegal, non-essential work to break a legitimate strike and protest.  It is clear to people that the Government, the Garda and the processes at work here serve the interests of the likes of Debenhams and not the interests of its workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200019#R00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620817200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I will reply to some of the comments made by the two Ministers of State in the course of the debate.  There is no argument whatsoever from anyone who is a serious observer of Irish labour law but that the proposals in the Cahill Duffy report would significantly improve rights for working people in this country.  The report has laid on the Minister's desk for five years now and the recommendations within it have not been acted on.  The Minister of State has some brass neck coming into the House and lecturing socialist Deputies on the issues of workers' rights and honesty, about which I will talk in a moment.<\/p>  <p>  Would the implementation of the proposals in the Cahill Duffy report have improved the situation for Debenhams workers?  The Minister of State says categorically they would not but Mr. Cahill and Mr. Duffy do not say that.  I was at the relevant committee meeting and I listened and questioned, and took careful notes.  What I took from what Mr. Cahill and Mr. Duffy said was that their recommendations may not have improved the situation for those workers but, on the other hand, they may have done.  They could not categorically answer the question and the Minister of State is twisting their words.  A lot boils down to the question of the value of the stock and the value of the online business that was taken from underneath the noses of the workers.<\/p>  <p>  It is the Government Deputies who have been dishonest in this debate, first and foremost the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, who have wandered down to picket lines and been photographed for newspapers, standing with the workers, but who then will line up behind the Minister and vote to defer the Debenhams Bill for a year.<\/p>  <p>  On social protection, workers paid into that fund every week for ten, 20 or 30 years.  One of the Debenhams workers had more than 40 years' service.  The Government should not try to pretend it is being generous by paying that money back to them.  In fact, back in the day, the State put 60% into that fund and the workers put in 40%.  The Government cut that back during the austerity years and now the workers have to pay 100%.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, said there will be a two-tier payment system through which some workers will get paid a collective agreement rate while others will get paid the statutory rate.  He is technically correct.  Would that not provide an incentive to workers who are in non-union jobs to get collective agreements?  To do that, those workers would have to organise and unionise.  I suspect that is the real fear of Fianna F&aacute;il on the issue.  In the opening sentences of his contribution, the Minister of State said that my proposal was timely and, in the next breath, he supported an amendment that would put it back for 12 months.  The Minister of State should make up his mind where he stands on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  The other Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the Government will have its act together on this in less than 12 months.  I would suggest it should withdraw the amendment but if it is not prepared to do so, do not delay the legislation by 12 months.  Delay it by three months or six months, if the Government must.  It will not do that because it wants to kick the can down the road for as long as it possibly can.  Why?  I know, the Government knows and the working people of this country know.  There is a jobs massacre coming up in the autumn when State supports will be withdrawn.  Nowhere will that be felt more keenly than in retail.  We want the protections for workers to be put in place and we have a sense of urgency about it.  The Government does not want those protection put in place, which is why it is kicking the can down the road.<\/p>  <p>  This is the anniversary of the execution of James Connolly, one of the greatest ever fighters for workers' rights.  It is, therefore, a good day to have a vote on an issue such as this.  We know on which side we will be.

Rents have doubled in the last decade.  The average rent statewide now stands at an eye-watering &euro;1,443 per month.  That is, of course, a shocking figure but will not come as a shock to those caught up in the crisis.  They feel it in their pockets every day.<\/p>  <p>  We now have the first generation of 20- and 30-year-olds who are worse off than their parents.  The rent crisis that we and they face is the result of the bad housing policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  It is happening because people who should have been able to buy their own home years ago are trapped in the private rental market.  Families who should be in public housing, paying fair rents, are trapped there too.  We know that wealthy investment funds, empowered by the Government's cushy tax deals, are snapping up family homes, renting them to those families at extortionate rates and all the while pushing up house prices.<\/p> <p>These are the same funds that have been buying up city apartment blocks for years and charging sky-high rents for those too.  Rising rents outside Dublin will no doubt act as an incentive for these funds to buy up housing, not alone across the commuter belt, but also into our regional cities.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach very plainly about his plan to tackle these vulture funds.  He did not answer me, however.  I can only surmise that he does not have a plan and that he proposes to sit on his hands.  The Taoiseach's weak response tells these funds they certainly have nothing to fear from his Government.  Not only does the Taoiseach not have a plan of his own, he will also reject the plans of others.  This evening, Fianna F&aacute;il and its partners in Fine Gael will block proposals to tackle these investment funds.  Government is also lining up to vote against a plan to cut rents and stop rent increases for three years.  How on earth can the Taoiseach say with a straight face that his policy is not to support these investment funds?  I suggest that what he must do here is not rocket science.  If I were Taoiseach, I would first end the tax advantages enjoyed by these institutional investors and get them to pay their fair share of corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Second, I would impose a stamp duty surcharge on the purchase of residential property by these investor funds.  Third, I would introduce emergency legislation to stop these funds bulk buying residential developments.  That is what the Taoiseach should do but his answer to each of those sensible, necessary proposals is \"No\", \"No\", \"No\".<\/p> <p> Is this why the Taoiseach led Fianna F&aacute;il back into government, to allow Fine Gael to continue to call the tune on housing?  This is a kick in the teeth for those robbed of the opportunity to buy a home by these funds and who in turn are being charged massive rents by them.  The Taoiseach said that housing is his number one priority but we still wait for his Government to do anything meaningful that will make a difference.  Almost a year into this Government, the Taoiseach remains wedded to policies that prioritise developers and investors over ordinary people.  That needs to stop because housing must be affordable again.<\/p> <p> I ask the Taoiseach this evening to do the right thing.  I ask him not to block the proposals that will make a difference but to support them and then to implement them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200020#S00600","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620817800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I led Fianna F&aacute;il back into government to deal with substantive issues such as housing and to make it a key priority issue because of the needs of people in society for housing as a fundamental right and a basic entitlement.  That is why we have spared no effort to comprehensively develop a range of initiatives and funding allocations to match those initiatives to get more houses built.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's motion this evening will not build one extra house.  The Deputy should be honest about it.  It would be far better if the Deputy and her party supported housing projects across the length and breadth of the country instead of opposing 975 houses in Clondalkin, 500 homes in Tallaght, 278 houses in Swords and 1,200 homes in Donabate.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in could do constructively to get more houses built in this country.<\/p>  <p>  The Government said we want to, and have committed, funding for the largest social housing programme in the history of the State, and to embed that in multiannual funding over the next five years.  Our target is to build 50,000 social houses to enable people to access housing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, however, we have now created a range of initiatives for affordable housing in order that young people will be able to buy houses at affordable rates.  Furthermore, we brought in for the first time a national cost-rental scheme, which we will scale up.  We have committed unprecedented funding to infrastructural development with &euro;1.2 billion in urban development generation funds alone, which will help to provide the services to enable more housebuilding to take place.  We have provided &euro;1.4 billion to Irish Water to support the construction of residential units.  That is substance and it will make a difference in terms of housing.<\/p>  <p>  I do not see any substance in Sinn F&eacute;in's plans.  I asked the Deputy yesterday whether she sees a role for private builders to start building on the other side of the coin to get more housing estates built.  The Deputy said \"No\".  She said it would be social housing only.  That is the only answer she has.  Sinn F&eacute;in's policies are shallow.  There is an absence of substance behind them.  Sinn F&eacute;in is more about rhetoric and sloganeering than about substance around housing.  I will not to be deflected by its sloganeering or the degree to which it wants to exploit the housing crisis for its own electoral and political advantage.<\/p>  <p>  My focus, and that of the Government, is to deal substantively with the issues to make sure we can create more supply, which is what is required.  We are simply not building enough houses or apartments in Ireland now, and have not been for some time.  We need all agencies of the State to make sure we can do that.  That also involves the Land Development Agency Bill and making sure all the land in State hands, which is not needed for other activities, is brought into use for housing.  That should be done with urgency.  State agencies and other Departments will have to surrender land to make sure we get houses built.  This is a crisis which this Government wants to deal with both energetically and in a focused way that gets real results.<\/p>  <p>  We have made it clear that we do not believe investment funds should be bulk buying or competing with first-time buyers in the marketplace.  The Government will take steps to deal with that issue and the Ministers are working on proposals that will also come forward.  We need supply.  Sinn F&eacute;in has opposed every single affordable housing initiative undertaken by the Government, including the Land Development Agency legislation, even on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200021#T00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1620817800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Let the House record that we are in the grip of a housing crisis, which is a social crisis and a social catastrophe for people up and down the length of this State.

It is true, however.  Despite its claims of ignorance about the activities of these cuckoo funds, the Government is up to its neck in it.  Last year, GillenMarkets, a financial advisory firm based in Dublin, published a note to its wealthy investors which stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe current high level house prices and rents in Ireland's residential property market have been driven in a significant way by the Government's housing policy with favourable policies attracting institutional investors such as IRES REIT into the market.  Their gradual move into the market has contributed to higher house prices and thus higher rents.  [It continues] &hellip; Overall the current housing policy has benefited both institutions and developers at the expense of individual buyers.  The potential risk for institutions such as IRES comes from a potential change in Government policy. <\/blockquote>  <p>The cuckoo funds do not really care about our housing crisis.  They only care about their bottom line.  They view the complete absence of affordable homes as a major incentive to invest here.  Worse, they view the lack of affordable homes as a deliberate Government policy.<\/p><p>The assessment by GillenMarkets of the Government's policy is pretty damning stuff.  The Government, however, is not unaware of it.  Last June, <i>The Times<\/i>, Ireland edition, published a lengthy article about this and contacted the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for a comment.  Regrettably, the Department did not seem interested.<\/p><p>Rents in Ireland increased by 62% between 2010 and 2020.  At the same time, the average rent across the European Union increased by 15%.  Is it any wonder that institutional investors are looking to Ireland?  Rents in Dublin are more than 30% higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger.  That does not come as a surprise to those who have been struggling to pay those rents.  It has not come as a surprise to those who have been trying to save for a mortgage because they know that renting is not sustainable in the long term with what is happening.<\/p><p>It is not that we only have a supply side crisis; we have an affordability crisis.  It is central to the problem.  All the evidence is that the best method of delivering affordability is the interventionist approach.  This is the one the global funds fear.

These provide for a range of schemes where the State is getting directly involved in building affordable housing, not just social housing.  It is through a range of supports, either through the serviced sites fund, the shared equity scheme or others, that the State is actually intervening to provide.  The cost-rental scheme is there too which, again, is State intervention.  I have already referenced the massive social housing side.<\/p>  <p>  The Ministers will deal with the issues which have arisen in respect of investment funds.  They were brought in in 2013 to bring investment to get apartment blocks built in high-density areas in cities.  Those are the origins of this.  From our perspective in the past ten months, the Cabinet committee on housing has met on a number of occasions.  The entire focus has been around affordability.  We have dealt with the social housing allocation and the budget was quite transformative in terms of the &euro;3.3 billion allocated.<\/p>  <p>  That marks an interventionist approach from the Government.  The issue, however, is that we are not building enough houses.  There is an issue in terms of development finance for house building.  That is the other side of the equation on which we need to work in terms of making sure that the cost of borrowing in respect of housing projects is at a level that makes projects viable.  For example, the Government is looking at how we can get greater development in brownfield sites in cities which makes sense from the perspective of climate change and developing compact cities in terms of public transport, services and so forth.<\/p>  <p>  A comprehensive approach is being taken.  For example, the urban regeneration fund of &euro;1.2 billion is designed to underpin greater residential development in our cities and in large urban areas.  The bulk of the investment from the State is going towards that.  We will deal with the issues which have arisen whereby we do not want the investment funds crowding out first-time buyers or moving into suburban housing estates.  A combination of measures will be taken.  The Ministers are working through that now and will come back to the Government on it.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be in no doubt that the Government is the biggest player in housing market in terms of investment and intervention.

However, Covid impacted on these because we have lost so much time through restrictions while construction was closed down for three to four months.

Every single day, evidence of the disastrous consequences of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il policies piles up.  In the past few weeks, there has been evidence about cuckoo funds pricing ordinary working people out of being able to buy homes.  Yesterday, evidence emerged of rents rising across the country by 7% and starting to rise again in Dublin.  Today, there is report about house prices rising 3.7% last year and increasing by an incredible 90% since 2012.  Walk outside the gates of Leinster House and there are tents with homeless people absolutely littering the streets.  In my area, residents of St. Helen's Court are victims of a vulture fund that is now trying to evict them even though they have done nothing wrong.<\/p>  <p>  All the Government suggests is that maybe we will impose a little stamp duty on purchases by these profit-hungry entities or slightly limit the percentage of these cuckoo funds that are wrecking the market and pricing ordinary working people out of it in the context of rents and house prices.  If we were dealing with the Bill put forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, these entities would still be able to buy 70% of estates.  The truth is what the Government needs to do is exclude the cuckoo and vulture funds that former Michael Noonan and Deputy Howlin invited into the country in 2012, 2013 and 2014.  They need to be excluded from the market altogether, as is the case in New Zealand.  We need rent controls, not pressure zones or 4% increases every year, in order to make rents affordable.  We need punitive taxes on any land or property hoarding or hoarding of vacant properties by speculators and investment funds.<\/p>  <p>  It is absolutely critical that we use the public land bank at scale to build public and genuinely affordable housing.  The proof the Government is not doing that is the Land Development Agency, LDA, Bill going through the D&aacute;il.  What that Bill will do is open up the public land bank to the same investment vehicles that have wrecked the private housing sector and priced a whole generation of young people and working people out of the housing market or made them prey to the extortionate rents charged by these vulture funds.  That is what the Government is doing.  The proof that the Government's commitments to change the policy are nonsense is the fact that the LDA Bill is a plan for a heist by the very investment vehicles that have profiteered at the expense of all the people who are in the grip of the housing crisis we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200023#V00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1620819000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>The Deputy has deliberately ignored the substance of the Government's intervention in the housing market.

If the legislation is to be successful, as we all want, it must be introduced at the same time in the South and the North.  That must happen for quite a simple reason, as the cost of drink today is substantially lower in Northern Ireland and with the introduction of this legislation's provisions, drink costs could be as much as double the prices in Northern Ireland.

There has been all-party agreement on this legislation in this House for quite some time, going back to 2018 and to 2013 and the reasons are obvious.  The view is that the below-cost selling of alcohol is harming children and young people in particular.  Some of the figures are quite horrendous.  For example, Ireland had the third highest level in the world of adolescent binge drinking, at 61% for females and 58.8% for males, according to data from the global study on progress in adolescent health and well-being published in <i>The Lancet<\/i>in March 2019.  Teenagers and children binge drinking bring significant issues for us as a society.<\/p><p>There is also an impact on hospitalisation and mortality figures.  In 2012, the cost of alcohol-related discharges from hospital was &euro;1.5 billion and the estimated cost of alcohol-related absenteeism from work was &euro;41 million in 2013.  In 2015, one in seven workers suffered work-related problems due to others drinking, including one in 20 workers reporting having to work extra hours due to co-workers drinking, with an estimated cost of &euro;46 million.<\/p><p>There are also wider concerns related to hospitalisations and it is now estimated the number of hospitalisations wholly attributed to alcohol rose by 94% between 1995 and 2018 from 9,420 to 18,348.  These figures are from the Department of Health and provided from clinical settings.  From 2008 to 2017 there were 10,000 alcohol-related deaths and the Health Research Board reckons these data are likely to represent an underestimate of alcohol-related mortality in Ireland.  The National Cancer Registry estimates that at current consumption levels, by 2035 male cancer cases attributable to alcohol will increase by 37% and female cancer cases will increase by 110%.

For years, various Government reports and reports from international think tanks have highlighted the problem of relatively high charges and fees in Ireland and the lack of transparency in terms of how they are presented.  A pensions report in 2012 from the Department of Social Protection noted that there are significant deficiencies and inconsistencies regarding transparency, with little evidence of a culture of providing clear information in a simple manner.  Likewise, a 2014 OECD report on Ireland's pension fees stated &quot;One of the most patent signs of a governance failure in [Ireland's] private pensions system is the high charges often observed&quot;, which are &quot;substantially above the charge levels observed in the best performing countries like Denmark or Sweden, where total management fees are below 0.5%&quot;.  The experience in Ireland is completely out of kilter with analogous European Union states.<\/p><p>The Minister for Social Protection, thanks to the initiative taken by the Labour Party, has now acknowledged the extent of this problem.  She has confirmed to me, by way of a reply to a parliamentary question, that her Department has recently called on the Pensions Authority to introduce a cost transparency initiative, which is an admission of the problem.  I hope the Minister and the Government, along with Opposition parties, will have the good sense to fully support this Labour Party Bill, which addresses the lack of transparency around fees charged and ultimately ensures that workers and pensioners can get a better deal and thus have a better quality of life in retirement.  <\/p><p>As it stands, most ordinary people are paying extraordinary sums of money from the pension pot they have worked hard to fill over time in excessive pension management charges and fees.  Despite the reports repeatedly referring, <i>ad nauseum<\/i>, to the problem, there has yet to be any real action from the Government to address the real problem of the opaque nature of pension fees.  This Bill, if passed, will finally require pension trustees to provide clear and concise information about the number and amount of charges under the scheme in both cash and percentage terms.  In simple terms, it will mean that pension customers will be able to see exactly how much they are being charged and how this will have an impact on their final pension pot without having to decode the complicated small print in annual budget statements or resorting to getting a degree in financial accounting or actuarial studies in order to understand what it all means.  In brief, these changes will radically transform the information available to savers and ensure that they can reliably compare the large amount of products on the market and get the best value for their retirement.<\/p><p>This comes down to protecting workers, protecting current and future pensioners who are doing their best to put away an adequate nest egg for their retirement.  This will become particularly important as we roll out auto-enrolment for pensions for those who do not have coverage.  People need to understand what these fees involve.  This will drive competition by making sure fees are presented in a more transparent way, thus equipping people with the information they are entitled to have to get a better deal for themselves.  It will also make the multibillion euro pensions industry honest.  In addition, it will help to ensure that the very significant tax reliefs provided to incentivise pension savings, which are paid for by all workers through their taxes, are no longer cannibalised by costly pension charges.  This is a necessary first step in reforming our pensions system and market for the betterment of working people and pensioners.  I urge everyone in this Chamber, when we introduce this Bill on Second Stage, to fully support it.  It is about transparency and who fears transparency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA00900","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA01000","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA01100","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1620822000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA01300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA01400","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1620822000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) (Foetal Pain Relief) Bill 2021: First Stage","time":1620822000,"counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA01700"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for pain relief for the foetus in certain cases of termination of pregnancy; and to provide for related matters. <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the ten co-sponsors of the legislation.

Under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, vets and farmers are required to use anaesthetics when carrying out any procedure on an animal.  <\/p><p>These attitudes to inflicting pain are an acknowledgement that to allow pain and suffering to be inflicted, where it can be avoided, would be an affront to human dignity.  This brings me to the subject matter of the Bill before us, namely the pain felt by unborn children in the womb in the context of surgical abortion procedures.  <\/p> <p>Medical science has known for some time that unborn babies can experience pain from 20 weeks' gestation.  However, an increasing body of scientific research, from approximately 2007 onwards, has suggested the brain and nervous system develop at a rate which means unborn babies may feel pain as early as 13 weeks.  The latest such study was published last year in the <i>Journal of Medical Ethics<\/i>.  A recent comprehensive review of the scientific literature by two experts, one of whom is pro-choice, concluded unborn babies may experience pain as early as 12 weeks and there was certainly no way to definitely exclude that possibility.<br\/><br\/>I look forward to discussing the substantial medical evidence which exists in support of the Bill on Second Stage and beyond.  The new research and newly available information must prompt a policy response from the Oireachtas, the reason being that abortion on demand is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy under the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.<br\/><br\/>From 12 weeks onwards, surgical abortions can be carried out in cases of so-called fatal foetal abnormalities or when doctors deem there to be a threat to the life or health of the mother.  Against the backdrop of the latest medical evidence, this leaves us with the disturbing possibility that every child subjected to a surgical abortion procedure after 12 weeks on these grounds not only has his or her life ended but has it ended in a manner in which he or she could be subjected to horrific pain and suffering in the process.  As human beings and legislators, we cannot stand by and ignore this.  Accordingly, this Bill makes a limited change to the 2018 Act by adding a new section requiring that anaesthetics be required for surgical abortions after 12 weeks and that cases in which this occurs be reported in line with the reporting requirements under the Act.<br\/><br\/>It is important to be clear on what this Bill does not do.  The 2018 Act would remain in force, so Members on all sides of the abortion debate could support this simple humanitarian amendment.  The Bill poses no risk to women because in cases in which an anaesthetic cannot be used for any medical reason, doctors can certify this and the provisions of the Bill would not apply.  It would cost women nothing nor would there be a significant cost to the State or the taxpayer.  <br\/><br\/>It is now routine for unborn children who are undergoing life-saving or corrective surgery to be given pain relief to ensure they feel no distress during the procedure.  Perinatal medicine now treats unborn babies, often as young as 18 weeks' gestation, for a range of conditions, during which care is taken to avoid inflicting pain.  In Britain, unborn babies receiving a newly developed surgical technique to correct spinal malformations receive pain relief as a matter of course.  All this Bill does is extend the same principle to all procedures carried out on unborn children, including surgical abortions.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is a concession to our humanity and compassion for all life, no matter what the circumstances.  Given the weight of the emerging scientific evidence, this is not an issue we can afford to ignore.  As we hear so often in these times, let us follow the science.<br\/><br\/>For the reasons I have outlined, I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to leading the debate on it on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200028#AA01800","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620822600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1620822600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB00600","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1620822600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ministerial Rota for Parliamentary Questions: Motion","time":1620822600,"counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat, notwithstanding anything in the Order of the D&aacute;il of 30th July, 2020, setting out the rota in which Questions to members of the Government are to be asked, Questions for oral answer, following those next set down to the Minister for Social Protection, shall be set down to Ministers in the following temporary sequence:  \tMinister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine<br \/><br \/>Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science<br \/><br \/>Minister for Justice<br \/><br \/>Minister for Health<br \/><br \/>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth whereupon the sequence established by the Order of 30th July, 2020, shall continue with Questions to the Minister for Rural and Community Development. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB01000","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1620822600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions","time":1620822600,"counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB01125"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Investigation","time":1620822600,"counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB01150"},{"type":"question","time":1620822600,"counter":236,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[23209\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the cost to date of commissions of investigation under the direction of his Department.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1620822600,"counter":237,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[24142\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200029#BB01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the full cost to date of the IBRC Commission; and the expenditure incurred in respect of legal fees by recipient law firms.","asker":"1522","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1620822600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions No. 1 and 2 together.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, I am the specified Minister for both the IRBC and the NAMA commissions of investigation.  Both commissions are fully independent in their investigations.  The IBRC commission of investigation was established by Government order in June 2015, following consultation with Oireachtas parties.  The IBRC commission's sole member is Mr. Justice Brian Cregan.  It is required to investigate certain transactions, activities and management decisions at the IBRC and in its first module it is investigating the Siteserv transaction which has been identified as a matter of significant public concern in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  The IBRC commission's original deadline for reporting was 31 December 2015, but following requests from the IBRC commission and after consultation with the Opposition, its timeframe for reporting has been extended on several occasions.  Most recently, in April of this year, I granted a further request from the IBRC commission for an extension of its timeframe for reporting on the Siteserv transaction, until the end of October 2021.<\/p>  <p>  From the time of its establishment in June 2015 to the end of April 2021, the IBRC commission spent approximately &euro;9,867,000, of which approximately &euro;4.9 million was spent on legal fees.  This does not include any expenditure on third-party legal costs that have been incurred but not yet paid.  It will be a matter for the IBRC commission to determine the validity of any claims for third-party legal costs at the end of its investigation.<\/p>  <p>  In the IBRC commission's seventh interim report in Feburary 2020, it estimated the final cost of the completion of the Siteserv investigation will be from &euro;12 to &euro;14.4 million.  This estimate assumed the investigation would be completed by the end of 2020, not the end of October 2021, as is now the case, and excluded costs or delays associated with possible judicial review hearings.  <\/p>  <p>  The IBRC commission also acknowledged there was a substantial degree of uncertainty regarding the amount of costs recoverable by parties before the IBRC commission and it assumed the commission's legal costs guidelines are not successfully challenged.<\/p>  <p>  The IBRC commission's ninth interim report does not provide any update on the &euro;12 million to &euro;14.4 million estimate but my Department has told Deputy Kelly on many occasions that the final cost is likely to significantly exceed the commission's estimate and could exceed &euro;30 million.<\/p>  <p>  The NAMA commission was established in June 2017, following consultations by the then Government with Opposition parties to investigate the sale by NAMA of its Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle.  The commission's sole member is Mr. Justice John D. Cooke.  Its original deadline for reporting was 31 June 2018, but following several requests from the commission, its timeframe for reporting has been extended.  Most recently, in March 2021, I granted a further request made by the NAMA commission in its tenth interim report for an extension of its timeframe for reporting until the end of September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  From the date of its establishment to the end of April 2021, the NAMA commission spent a total of approximately &euro;3.2 million, excluding any third-party legal costs that have been incurred but not yet paid.

The IBRC commission will be six years old in June.  It is investigating 38 transactions in which there was a loss of &euro;10 million or more in the former Anglo Irish Bank but has been been working on Siteserv alone for its whole existence.  It was reported on <i>thecurrency.news<\/i>that the commission had completed approximately three quarters of its draft report, or 900 pages, and the full report should be completed by the end of June.<\/p><p>The projected cost when it was set up in 2015 was, amazingly, &euro;4 million.  It is laughable.  According to estimates by <i>thecurrency.news<\/i>, it has cost up to &euro;70 million so far.  When we add up its costs - there were also 100 witnesses - they amount to just under &euro;80,000 per page.  If this is the case, and I accept it is an &quot;if&quot; but I am relaying what has been reported, it will cost more than what was received by the IBRC.  That is laughable, and I believe the Taoiseach agrees with me.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach has commented in the past that he has deep concerns about this matter.  Those comments are at odds with what he has said publicly both in his response today and in response to parliamentary questions I have asked.  Costs of &euro;9.4 million have been incurred to date, according to what he has just said.  I know the Government has granted an extension but what is the real estimate?  The commission must have a budget for going forward.  What does the Government estimate this will end up costing?  Is the figure of &euro;30 million accurate or is &euro;70 million more accurate?  There is a huge difference between those figures.  The Taoiseach expressed serious concerns in January 2019, while in opposition, regarding the costs and delays.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt is now an issue of concern that an inquiry can drag on for so long and at such expense.  The Taoiseach is now estimating that the commission will cost &euro;30 million, which is extraordinary, particularly when compared to inquiries in other countries which do not take the same length of time or incur the same level of costs. <\/blockquote> <p>Those are the Taoiseach's words, not mine.  It is quite obvious that we need to rethink such commissions and I think the Taoiseach agrees with me.  We cannot be setting up such commissions and then have the estimated costs and timeframe go out the window.  We could run into this issue again as other matters arise down the road and we face them in Parliament.  What is the Taoiseach's view on the timeline and final costs for this investigation?  Does he accept that the current costs, as stated, are nowhere near the mark?  What are we going to do about future commissions, in order that they can reach decisions and have reasonable costs?

The figure of &euro;30 million is certainly well short and the other figure of &euro;70 million that has been mentioned is closer to the mark.  The commission spent &euro;4,000 on bringing a banking expert from Thailand and more than &euro;1,500 was spent on tissues.  I find it hard to get my head around that.

I know he is not in a position to say exactly what they will be as that is to be determined at the end of the investigation but it strikes me that the third-party legal costs will not be on the low side.

The idea of these commissions was to allow for a thorough investigation of matters such as this, which are of huge public concern.  We should not disregard the fact that there was an absolute necessity for these matters to be investigated.  Yet, here we are.  Does the Taoiseach share my concern?

It is a matter for the House to re-engage collectively to work out the best models of investigations.  When the commissions of investigation legislation was introduced originally by the then Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, it was with a view to having more efficient and expeditious inquiries to replace the tribunals of inquiry, which were deemed to be going on far too long and were very expensive and costly.  The constitutional framework guaranteeing people's rights and liberties, such as the right to their good name and so on, is the overarching framework within which we all have to operate.  That is clear.  We need to work collectively on this into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I am also of the view that very often, the fact that we have to set up commissions of investigation is a reflection of our existing systems of oversight.  We have the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for example, which is there to hold the Garda accountable, yet we leapfrog those systems immediately in this House when we want an inquiry.  Very often, there are regulatory authorities in place right across the board and we need to re-examine them.  The existing regulatory authorities are the ones that should be engaging in issues that require examination, oversight and investigation, with a view to not having to have the types of large and comprehensive investigations we have commissioned and sought in this House.  We have oversight bodies, such as HIQA in health, and we have to work to make them clearly independent in serving the public interest and dealing with issues long before they become the subject matter of specific investigations commissioned by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>  <p>  As regards third-party costs, we do not quite know what the full cost of this particular commission of investigation is going to be.  I have read the ninth interim report of the commission.  The draft final report will have to be circulated to all affected parties for their comments and so they can review it and make submissions to the commission.  The commission is of the view that that will take two to three months and it considers it will be in a position to submit its final report by 31 October.  It has stated that about 75% of its draft report is concluded.  It is on target to meet that October deadline.

The council&rsquo;s recommended actions to deliver change in the area of housing are concerned with bridging the supply gap by actively managing land for the public good and the affordability gap by engineering in permanent affordability.  This is important work and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, could do well to pay more attention to it.<\/p>  <p>  Two things struck me in recent times as I listened to the Taoiseach and his colleagues attempt to defend their record on housing.  The first thing is that the Taoiseach presents the housing crisis as though it was a relatively new phenomenon.  Of course, this narrative suits him.  He would like us to forget that he was a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Cabinet which squandered the economic boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which was funded largely at the time by European structural funds as the Taoiseach will recall.  He would also like us to forget that it was Fianna F&aacute;il that nurtured the speculative and highly cyclical system of housing supply in Ireland that concerns the NESC so much.  It was Fine Gael, of course, that doubled down on that strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The facts and evidence now speak for themselves.  The cost of renting has now nearly doubled in Dublin over the last decade and home ownership at the age of 30 has halved in the space of a generation.  As the lead author of a study from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated this week, \"each successive generation [is now] less likely\" than the last one to own their own homes by that age.  That is the record of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government.  Despite the Government's petty sound bites, the truth is that Sinn F&eacute;in's analysis and our solutions, be they in legislation or policy, reflect the fundamental and transformative change to Ireland's policy that NESC, the ESRI and so many others, but especially the young, are now crying out for.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, I urge the Taoiseach to study the deliberations from NESC, the ESRI and all the other experts in the field and to listen to the voices of the generation locked out of home ownership, many of whom are falling into homelessness and \"Generation Rent\", as they are called.  I also urge the Taoiseach to replace the kind of sound bite hostility and the almost glib attitude that he adopts, and instead work for the kind of fundamental transformation we need.  I am urging him to do this because in the absence of that transformation we will be in this housing crisis for a very long time and that is simply not tolerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200031#DD00900","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1620823800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Thousands of young people and their parents woke up to a notification on their phones yesterday morning that stated the ESRI had found that those aged under 30 are likely to be the first generation worse off than their parents due to stagnant wages and a collapse in home ownership rates.  That was the message that people's phones alerted them to, but those young people did not need that message or proof.  This is a generation of young people who work hard and who get up earlier than their parents in the morning, but who have been let down.  It is simply not a country for young people.  These young people are earning less than young people did in the 1990s and early 2000s.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has wreaked havoc on their careers, their incomes, their opportunities, their desires and their ambitions.  Young people who are more likely to work in the retail, hospitality, arts or leisure sectors will have had even lower wages over the last year and a half.  Couples having lower wages combined with higher and rising rents means it is not surprising that home ownership for these people is just a pipe dream.  The report from the ESRI found that while Covid-19 hit older people's health, it has hit young people's prospects of employment and earnings severely.  Some 112,000 fewer people aged between 15 years old and 34 years old were in paid work in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a year earlier.  Moreover, this situation has impacted their mental health.  Young people have been left without help or hope throughout this pandemic.  They are spending up to 30% of their disposable income on housing and that is not sustainable.  Will NESC be examining this issue and what solutions will it be pursuing?<\/p>  <p>  An extensive report was published by NESC in April on housing and urban development policy priorities.  It calls for a site value tax and also for the reform of compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers and sale orders for vacant land and property.  Would the Taoiseach support a tax on vacant housing, for example?  It is a tool we believe should be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200031#DD01000","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1620823800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The National Economic and Social Council has regularly referred to the issue of water quality and the need to address the very poor levels of water quality as a result of the discharge in multiple locations across this country of untreated sewage.  In my area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire alone, untreated sewage goes into Dublin Bay at 11 points.  I see the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, issuing figures suggesting things have slightly improved, but a large caveat must accompany those figures because testing only takes place during what is called the bathing season.  My colleague, Councillor Melissa Halpin, moved a motion in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council seeking year-round testing.  She was basically told the council did not have the resources to do that.<\/p>  <p>  Ringsend treatment plant has an ultraviolet treatment machine that can reduce the bacterial load of sewage going into Dublin Bay, but it is only used for a few months of the year.  I presume that is for cost reasons.  The decrepit state of the water infrastructure means that when it rains we get big discharges of sewage into the sea, because the surface water mixes with sewage and then overflows.  That happens because we have not rehabilitated the water infrastructure.  This is a pretty poor show from the perspective of all the people swimming, more now than ever before, but equally in respect of the damage being done to biodiversity in Dublin Bay and other places in the country where we have similar situations, such as in Clifden and Galway, for example.<\/p>  <p>  At the very moment all this is happening, workers in the local authorities are being transferred to Irish Water.

That is occurring because Irish Water is failing in its duty to rehabilitate the infrastructure and to give us the water treatment required to prevent the pollution of our seawaters and rivers with sewage.<\/p> <p>Therefore, it seems to me that the Government needs to start to listen to the NESC on this and recognise the urgent issue of addressing the decrepit nature of our foul water infrastructure and water quality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200031#DD01100","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620824400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>There are just over four minutes remaining for this question and we have three other questioners.

I believe the Government is very worried about spooking the cuckoo.  As it does not want to spook the international investors or the vulture funds, it claims we must move carefully and slowly.  The last thing we need to do is to move carefully and slowly.  We do need to spook and frighten them and to make sure that they know that the game is up and they can no longer suck the life and blood out of people in this country who are on waiting lists, young people who are trying to buy their own homes and people who cannot afford to rent.

We need sustainable development, not the sort of development that we are seeing all over constituencies like mine that are expanding under the guise of strategic housing developments.

Is it a ticking time bomb that will blow up this Government?  Daft has stated this morning that we have just witnessed the largest quarterly increases in rent since the middle of 2018.  In Cork city, rents have increased by 6.3% in the first quarter of 2021 in comparison to the first quarter of last year.  The average rent is &euro;1,483.  In County Cork there has been an incredible 8.7% increase, bringing average rents to &euro;1,137.  In the Munster area, there has been an 8.8% increase, with just 238 properties available to rent.<\/p>  <p>  These rent increases have taken place at a time when there was meant to be a national rent freeze.  The mind boggles as to what rent increases we might see now that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Government have decided to take the handbrake off and to end the blanket ban on rent increases, while ending the blanket ban on evictions while they are at it .<\/p>  <p>  The figures detailing housing availability in the Munster area point to the need for a massive programme of social housing building.  In the D&aacute;il this week, the Government talked up its public housebuilding credentials somewhat, but it measured it against the very low figures of recent years, when it needs to be measured against the scale of the existing housing need.  Those rent increases show that the Government is failing in that regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200032#EE00600","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1620824400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>A number of interventions have been made so I will need some time to deal with them.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald spoke first.  Government policy is very much focused on the key issue of the supply gap.  I kept saying this to the Deputy for the past number of days.  It is about supply, supply, supply.  It is the key to the housing issue.  We simply need to build more houses and we need to do it in a variety of ways.  We do not need to put all of our eggs into the one basket, which was suggested by a number of speakers today.<\/p>  <p>  Yes, the Government is committed to a massive social housing programme in comparison to what went on before.  However, to get 50,000 social houses built in the next five years will be challenging to the local authorities and the agencies.  The fallback of Deputy Barry is that we should have a massive programme, whatever that means.  I have not seen one concrete proposal from Deputy Barry or others as to how to increase supply now, in the next three months or the next six months.  I acknowledge that it needs a radical, whole-of-government approach.  That is what we are going to do.  We have been in office for ten months.  In response to Deputy McDonald, I have not been in government for ten years.  I am interested in the future and the young people of today and that the Government and this House can make a difference now in order that the young people of today have a realistic chance of getting housing and of buying housing.  That is where my focus is.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry has spoken about a ticking political bomb for the Government.  It is not about Government or parties.  It should not be.  It should not be about political point-scoring or who will gain an electoral advantage out of the crisis, which is what I am hearing from my perspective.  It is about concrete measures that can get houses built and can enable houses to be affordable for young people.  That does mean dealing with the supply gap and getting to a situation where we can build far more houses than we are currently building.<\/p>  <p>  Taking last year, for example, approximately 20,000 houses were built.  Where are the thousands and thousands of apartments the Deputies are all talking about?  Some 20,000 houses were built last year and approximately 7,000 to 8,000 of that were social houses.  Many more single houses were built all over Ireland.  There is not private sector activity to the level there should be, actually.  We need both public and private sector housing programmes.  The ESRI has indicated saying we need 30,000 houses.  Given the shortfall in the last three years and the impact of Covid, in my view, we need to increase that to potentially 40,000.  Let us put the ideology to one side and get houses built.  On a number of fronts, that is what we need to do.  The State land is important.  There is disagreement in terms of the remit and role of the Land Development Agency.  It has been talked about for years.  This Government is determined to get the legislative template through, to get action going and to get State land used for housing.  In our view, there is much State land that is close to and in cities and towns that could be used for housing.  Housing is the number one crisis and we must prioritise it above all and everything else.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Barry has spoken of a ticking political timebomb for the Government.  It is not about the Government or parties.  It should not be.  It should not be about political point-scoring or who will gain an electoral advantage out of the crisis, which is what I am hearing from my perspective.  It is about concrete measures that can get houses built, enable houses to be affordable for young people.  That does mean dealing with the supply gap and getting to the situation where we can build far more houses that we are currently building.  Taking last year, for example, around 20,00<\/p> <p>That means using State land for social housing, affordable housing and a variety of schemes.  It frustrates me that something like the Oscar Traynor Road issue can go on for years.  That is an inability of the political system to deliver 800 houses that people desperately need.  There are people in Dublin City Council who are going to go on interrogating this issue and will probably come up with new schemes that will take another five or six years to develop.  That is what is going on in regard to many of the projects I outlined this morning that are being objected to.<\/p> <p> If we are all agreed that this is a crisis that needs more supply, then we should deal with it in a really forthright way.  Affordability is at the core of the Government's policy.  The affordability legislation the Minister has introduced is designed to deal with the affordability question.  There is investment going into capital, particularly in cities, regional cities and towns, to underpin the need for more residential development and housing.  A total of &euro;1.4 billion is going into water and &euro;1.2 billion into the urban regeneration and development fund.

It is a response to a situation that caused disquiet among many people, namely, the actions of certain individuals in North Frederick Street in 2018.  By any stretch of the imagination, those individuals acted in an unacceptable fashion.  As such, there was a requirement to deal with the issue that arose in this legislation.  Most of us who were involved with the original private security services legislation dating back to 2004 believed that individuals involved in situations such as that which arose in 2018 would be covered but clearly they were not.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire proposed a very straightforward Bill to extend the list of covered individuals under the Private Security Services Act to include those private security firms involved in the enforcement of court orders.  The Minister of State wanted to go further.  Although it has taken some time, not only is that matter being addressed in the Bill before us but a number of other issues I wish to mention are also being dealt with.  As I mentioned on the previous occasion, as a matter of principle, when an Opposition Deputy comes forward with a very workable Bill, it should be taken on board, even if it needed to be amended on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the list of covered security services set out in 2004 Act, it was clear that those involved in enforcing court orders, that is, private contractors, also needed to be covered.  That will now happen under the provisions of the Bill before us.  For clarity, exemptions have been made in the Minister of State's Bill.  He amends section 2 of the principal Act with a new section 2 that will add enforcement guard to the list of security services covered.  In section 3, he proposes to clarify this by the insertion of the phrase\"a further exemption from licensing by the Private Security Authority for those engaged in the enforced collection of Revenue liabilities by a Sheriff\".  Some of our colleagues do not believe that is the correct way to go.  We will be debating their suggestions later on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The appointed sheriffs enforce debt owed to Revenue.  Sheriffs employ their own staff, and staff may also be appointed as bailiffs and-or court messengers.  As the Minister of State indicated when introducing the Bill, sheriffs generally do not engage private security firms.  In exceptional circumstances where a sheriff may need to engage security personnel, however, under the newly proposed section 3, such personnel would also be encompassed under the terms of the principal Act and would need to be registered.  When replying, the Minister of State might clarify and confirm that temporary staff taken on for a particular function by a sheriff would also be encompassed by that and are not simply contracted staff or professional security staff.<\/p>  <p>  Other proposed amendments go slightly further than the original proposal to include those involved in the enforcement of court orders as registerable individuals under the Private Security Authority, allowing the Authority to refuse to renew a licence or suspend or revoke the licence of a body corporate due to the actions of its individual members.  That is a very worthwhile amendment.  Where a large security company has individual members who are acting in a rogue fashion, it is important that the authority has the capacity to revoke or refuse to renew a licence for such a company.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 provides for making the register of licensed persons available for inspection.  We assumed that was always the case and it has been with regard to a written register at the principal office of the Authority.  Can the Minister confirm that section 5 will ensure that any citizen can simply log on to this new register and be able to identify an individual who is liable to be properly registered under the Private Security Authority, if there is any doubt, and that this facility will be open to every member of the public?  I hope that is the intention behind this section.  Again, the Minister of State might comment on that for clarity's sake.<\/p>  <p>  The new offence of impersonating an inspector of the authority created in section 6 is interesting.  Obviously, it came from the authority itself.  Have there been some cases where individuals have been impersonating officers of the authority?  Was it required to put in this new section 6, amending section 48(1) of the principal Act, by creating this new offence of impersonating an inspector and making it a criminal offence liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for 12 months?  I would be interested to hear if there is a body of evidence that said this particular action was required.  Again, I have no objection to it.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 4(4) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926, court officers are obliged to display court messengers' names and places of residence.  Obviously, in changed times, the Minister of State has reconsidered the matter and wants to remove this obligation by repealing that necessity.<\/p> <p>Again, my default position is normally for as much transparency as possible.  However, I can see that there may well be a case for repealing section 4(4) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926.  I would like to hear the Minister of State reinforce this in his summation.  While that Act goes back to 1926, there may be a feeling currently that court officers or messengers might feel in some way intimidated if their names were in the public domain.  It may well be a justifiable move to remove the requirement for that publication.<\/p> <p> In general, I have no difficulty with this legislation.  There will be some sort of debate on the issue of the enforcement of court orders.  If one believes in the rule of law, as I do, the decision makers, ultimately, of what is lawful and constitutional in the State are our legally appointed courts.  Courts without enforcement authority, however, are toothless.  If people feel there is no capacity for a court order to be enforced, then they are worthless in and of themselves.  There has to be an enforcement mechanism, once fair procedures are afforded to every citizen under the Constitution and the rule of law.<\/p> <p> Our courts are the envy of other courts internationally.  We can debate the appointment system in due course.  However, since the foundation of the State, we have been extraordinarily well served by our Judiciary, as well as the fairness and impartiality of the judicial system.  Over the decades, many have been appointed to the Bench who had former political incarnations.  I believe that even the parties to which these individuals formerly belonged often were surprised at the degree of absolute impartiality they maintained once they took the oath of office to serve as independent judges under the Constitution.<\/p> <p> It is important that we allow the orders of the courts, duly made after due process and fair hearing, to be enforced.  It is also important that we do not tie the hands of those enforcing them to such a degree that the courts themselves are toothless and the orders they make are meaningless.  That would be a dangerous situation.<\/p> <p> In any of this - this is what comes to the nub of the initial mover of the Bill - it has to be done in a way that is sympathetic and acceptable to the public view while not intimidating or heavy-handed.  Where that line of reasonableness is passed, there has to be an oversight body which can adjudicate on those issues.  That is why it is appropriate that anybody enforcing any order of any court is covered by this.<\/p> <p> The list of individuals covered by this legislation is broad, ranging from door supervisor, installer of security equipment, private investigator, security consultant, security guard, provider of protected forms of transport, locksmith, supplier and installer of safes and now enforcers of court orders.  It is a comprehensive list of individuals who have significant roles to play in maintaining people's safety and security.  They must always act in a way that is appropriate and respects the dignity of every citizen while not intimidatory or heavy-handed.  We will have to obviously watch with great care how the security authority itself, which is still a relatively new entity in the organisation of oversight bodies in the State, operates.  If we need in the future to strengthen its hand, we should be ready as a Legislature to do just that.<\/p> <p> Meanwhile, there is nothing in the provisions, as set out by the Minister of State in this legislation, to which I would object.  I would welcome the specific answers to the questions I posed about the details.  I am sure the Minister of State will give these in his response before the conclusion of Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200035#NN00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620826500,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to examine the Private Security Services (Amendment) Bill 2021.  Like Deputy Howlin, I remember the implications in 2004 when the Private Security Services Act was brought in to regulate that industry, because it was seen as unregulated.  There were implications then, obviously, for various service operators which were welcome.  This amending legislation is also welcome.  In time, further amendments may be required.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note how, in a relatively short period, amending legislation such as this has come before the House.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this important legislation which amends and repeals certain provisions of the Private Security Services Act 2004 and the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will bring those who assist in the enforcement of court orders for evictions and repossessions under the regulation of the Private Security Authority.  Currently, private security firms engaged in the enforcement of court orders, including the repossession of properties, do not fall under a category for licensing through the Private Security Authority.  This omission has clear implications for the oversight and regulation of private security firms that may be involved in repossessions.  There have been a number of high-profile and contentious evictions in recent years in which private security firms have taken part.  These include the events at both Strokestown and North Frederick Street in 2018.  Both events led to violent incidents, unfortunately.  There were clashes with garda&iacute; in North Frederick Street, while a number of people were attacked following the eviction which took place in Strokestown.  In light of the demonstrable danger which may arise in the execution of court orders for those within a property, and indeed for operatives of private security firms, it is clear there must be accountability and regulation in this area.  It is essential that those providing security services should operate to the highest standards.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill's main provision is the insertion of an additional category and a definition of \"enforcement guard\" in the list of security services covered by the Private Security Services Act 2004.  This will require enforcement guards to obtain a licence to operate, as well as ensuring they are subject to the training standards and licensing regime operated by the authority.  With the introduction of these amendments, the Private Security Authority can continue to provide its important role in the private security industry, as well as the contribution it makes to the protection of our community.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also makes several additional amendments including allowing the authority to refuse to renew a licence or suspend or revoke a licence of a body corporate because of the actions of its members.  That is an important provision because it was missing all along.  It makes the register of licensed persons available for inspection free of charge to members of the public.  It introduces a new offence of impersonating an inspector of the authority.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us will recall the removal of persons occupying a private property on North Frederick Street in September 2018 on foot of a High Court order, which found they were unlawfully occupying the property.  The persons were removed by a private security firm.  Currently, personnel involved in the enforcement of court orders are not subject to regulation on the basis that this activity does not fall within the definition of what constitutes a security service under the Private Security Services Act 2004.  In light of the widespread public outrage at the events at the property on North Frederick Street, along with the inherent risks associated with unregulated persons carrying out such functions, the then Minister for Justice and Equality made a commitment to the D&aacute;il in September 2018 that the law would be amended.<\/p> <p>The matter was considered by an interdepartmental working group which recommended bringing such personnel within the licensing remit of the PSA.  Enhanced regulation of the sector was also called for by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in 2018.  Ultimately, private security staff occupy a position of trust, engaging in regular interactions with members of the public.  Those providing security services must, therefore, operate to the highest standards.  This Bill will help to ensure that objective is realised and I call on all Deputies to support the measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200036#OO00200","speaker":"1481","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620827100,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill to introduce a new category for those involved in evictions.  However, I will address a concern I have about one aspect of the often overlooked private security sector, namely, persons who install security systems, access control, fire alarms, etc.  They are also regulated and licensed by the PSA.  At the beginning of the pandemic when lockdown and all the restrictions were still very fresh, these professional, regulated installers continued to operate to ensure closed premises were secure, safe and protected.  This offered valuable reassurance to the businesses and their users but also to insurance companies and operators.<\/p>  <p>  There are over 50 of these compliant, licensed providers in my constituency, the vast majority of which are small operators.  Like many other small businesses, their income dried up over the pandemic period.  Most of them work out of vans and conduct their administration from their kitchen table.  The Minister of State spoke of the key contribution of the sector, trust, confidence and appreciation.  How exactly were those virtues reflected by the Government in April 2020, when the board of the PSA submitted proposals to have the licence fees for these contractors adjusted to take account of the additional expenses incurred due to Covid-19 restrictions, and also the new health and safety requirements that were put in place?  That review was ignored.  The authority was asked to submit a second one, which it did.  Its second proposal was rejected out of hand and there was not a chance of it being implemented.  This was following consideration by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which deemed any deferral of income to the Exchequer a disproportionate response.  The PSA then suggested an instalment arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  This goes back to how little understanding some Governments have of the PSA and the work it does.  This was never going to be a loss of income.  It would have been a deferral.  I ask the Government to think about the knock-on impact this will have.  There will be an increase in the number of people operating in the black market which the PSA is tasked with investigating.  Of greater concern is that when the number of licensed operators falls, there is also a fall in the number of businesses willing and able to take on apprentices and the young people who want to work in this sector and engage with the SOLAS apprenticeship programme.  This will happen if there continues to be an exodus from this industry.<\/p>  <p>  I have already mentioned the increased workload on the PSA.  This was an extremely short-sighted position to adopt.  The Minister of State can wax lyrical about the industry but those are the facts and that is exactly what happened.  As we come out of this pandemic and seek to support small businesses, the Government should stop and see what supports have been put in place for this sector, which has provided a guarantee and reassurance to businesses that were closed that their premises were safe, protected and would be fit to be reopened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200037#PP00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1620827100,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I support the legislation.  Evictions and court orders are not covered by the Private Security Services Act 2004 as it stands and therefore do not fall within the remit of the Private Security Authority.  There was probably an expectation that these would be covered but it is only when something occurs that one sees gaps in legislation.  The legislation was originally introduced in 2004, at the height of the Celtic tiger era.  We tend to try to future-proof legislation but very often we are captured by a particular sentiment at a given time.  Who would have predicted there would be a crash of the magnitude that we had, or the subsequent housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Evictions and court orders can be carried out by anyone once the court orders issue and no licence is needed.

That has been commented on in the context of certain events in recent years.  An obvious example is the eviction of the McGann family near Strokestown, County Roscommon, in 2018.  The eviction was ordered by the High Court as there was an unpaid debt to KBC Bank.  KBC hired GS Agencies limited to enforce the eviction.  GS Agencies is run by a debt collector and an ex-British soldier who served in the Royal Irish Regiment and Ulster Defence Regiment.  He contacted former colleagues in one part of the eviction, requesting that they travel to County Roscommon and name their price.  In the aftermath of the eviction, the scene turned violent with several people left injured, vehicles burned and a dog killed.  A former colleague of the owner of GS Agencies said: \"He seems to gets the jobs no other security firm wants so he&rsquo;s subcontracted and he then subcontracts further to get people to do the dirty work.\"<\/p>  <p>  Those direct experiences inform some of the measures in the legislation.  The security firm involved in the Strokestown case was found guilty of six breaches of the Private Security Services Act due to its occupation of the house after the eviction.  As I say, it is the examples that give us an insight.  It was reported in the media at the time that a Garda superintendent ordered the entrances of the house to be closed off during the eviction.  We have no way of knowing if that was the case as I do not know if the report was substantiated.  However, there was a Garda presence outside the boundaries of the property observing the eviction taking place.  Given that it was a unregulated entity that carried this out eviction and acted in the way it did, it brought the Garda into disrepute.<\/p>  <p>  The case of the North Frederick Street eviction occurred in the same year.  Housing activists were removed from a vacant building they were occupying in defiance of a court order.  The occupation was part of the Take Back the City movement.  There was a substantial Garda presence but physical force was used against a number of the attendees and five activists were arrested.  It drew criticism from the Opposition, Amnesty International and the ICCL, and very understandably so.  Then, in Phibsborough in 2020, nine tenants were evicted from a property on Berkeley Road.  The tenants had not received a legal eviction notice but had received a message on Facebook.  I come across cases such as this all the time.  This area is regulated but does not fall within the Minister of State's remit.  It is set out in law what the regime should be.  I am sure the Minister of State hears about people who have been given notice to quit by way of a text message, Facebook message or email.<\/p> <p>Such a notice often does not pay any attention to the timeframe that people have or an expectation of protections under the law with respect to notice of an eviction.  It is not part of this legislation but it is interesting that it throws up the requirement for a much more solid piece of public information around the question.  It causes unnecessary anxiety in the case of challenge and if notice has not been properly served, the eviction cannot take place.  That is very much part of the eviction process under discussion and the main reason it was deemed invalid, with the tenants returned to the property.  A significant amount of damage was done, as indicated by photographs we saw online.  Doors were pulled down and the toilet was smashed.  That was to ensure people would not come back in and the house would not be habitable.<\/p> <p> Evictions will take place and court orders should be complied with.  This must be done in a humane way and those kinds of examples cause understandable outrage, bringing parties like the Garda into disrepute as well.  We should be concerned by the number of evictions that could potentially happen.  Last month, Threshold flagged a backlog of 1,000 cases of people who received paused eviction notices last year alone.  Most would have been paused in the context of Covid-19.  There were 467 cases of people living in Dublin and there are only 654 properties available to rent in Dublin for less than &euro;1,500.  Most of the eviction notices I see, or where people draw my attention to them while seeking advice, arise where people simply cannot pay the rent.  It is not about antisocial behaviour, although I have come across cases involving such behaviour.<\/p> <p> If we look around the country, the number of vacant premises under the housing assistance payment limits gives an indication of the reasons some of these eviction notices are served.  There may be a more humane approach to evictions and there is a substantial concern underneath relating to the affordability of housing both for rental and to buy.  We cannot discuss this legislation without highlighting that question.  It may be why it might be prudent to extend the ban on evictions, perhaps for another 12 months.  There is a substantial problem, with no obvious remedy for people who are really struggling currently.<\/p> <p> Higher standards are required from private security firms and garda&iacute; when it comes to enforcement of court-ordered evictions.  We must ensure the security services hired to enforce legal orders work humanely and professionally, being held accountable for their actions.  Bringing these private security firms under the remit of this legislation means anybody involved with enforcing court orders would be subject to high standards, oversight, licensing and a complaints procedure.  They would be required to carry identification as well, and this would all be a very substantial improvement on what we have currently.<\/p> <p> This Bill would not solve all the problems because some of them are not really part of the legislation at all but a wider concern.  That wider matter is that a substantial number of people are the subject of eviction notices who would not be in a properly functioning housing market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200037#PP00300","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620827700,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this legislation, particularly in view of the prominence of many high-profile cases concerning evictions in recent times.  The legislation will allow the Government to bring the regulation and licensing of security personnel assisting those enforcing court orders for evictions and repossessions within the remit of the Private Security Authority.  Currently, private security firms engaged in the enforcement of court orders, including the repossession of properties, do not fall under a category for licensing through the Private Security Authority.  This omission has clear implications for the oversight and regulation of private security firms that may be involved in repossessions.<\/p>  <p>  There have been a number of high-profile and contentious evictions in recent years, as I mentioned, in which private security firms have taken part.  There is demonstrable danger that may arise following such incidents and the execution of court orders has caused many problems for people working in private security and those involved in these incidents in the first place.  It is essential that people providing private security should be able to operate under the highest standards, as set out in legislation, and we have a duty to protect this area as well.  There is an enormous grey area that has caused much confusion and anger, with many high-profile incidents over the past number of years.  Unfortunately, they have dragged members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into disrepute as well, and this must be avoided.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us recall the removal of personnel that were trespassing and illegally occupying a property on North Frederick Street in September 2018 on foot of a High Court order.  The persons were removed by a private security firm and the personnel who attended at the property on behalf of the private security firm are not currently subject to regulation or licensing by the Private Security Authority under the Private Security Services Act 2004, as amended.  This is because this activity does not fall within the definition of what constitutes a security service under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Private Security Authority is responsible for the regulation of the private security industry.  The authority is an important and independent agency under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  It is charged with introducing, controlling and managing a comprehensive standards-based licensing system for the private security industry.  Private security staff occupy a position of trust, engaging in regular interactions with members of the public and it is therefore essential that this area is properly regulated in order to protect public safety and confidence.<\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Private Security Services (Amendment) Bill 2021 is to include an additional category and a definition of \"enforcement guard\" in the list of security services covered by the Private Security Services Act 2004.  I hope that this amendment will provide clients of private security service providers with assurance that the industry is working to the highest standards possible and that what occurred on North Frederick Street will not recur.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the recession and following the consequences of the financial crash in Ireland, the subject of this Bill became common in recent years.  It has been extremely stressful for so many different families to have to go through such a process and it is horrible that something like this can happen on people's doorstep.  With regard to those who are involved with repossessions, we must be very clear that we, as a State, have failed to provide the clarification required in legislation.  It is important for us to do that now.<\/p>  <p>  The members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been doing extraordinary work in this country for the past number of years, particularly over the past 12 months.  Evictions are always incredibly challenging and, unfortunately, in some circumstances where garda&iacute; are required, it can be incredibly stressful for them too.  I hope the work we are doing as an Oireachtas in helping the Minister of State can help to address the questions in the area so comprehensive answers can be found.  I hope we will not remain in a position where grey areas leave major resources in the State having to be tied up in courts, especially when we could solve this with legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200038#QQ00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1620827700,"counter":325,"content":"<p>This is an area where reform is long overdue.  The country has had a long history of landlordism and evictions, and to put it mildly, there have been and still are many unsavoury characters involved.<\/p> <p>Just yesterday I received a call from a constituent who had been given four months' notice of eviction in January in the middle of level 5 restrictions.  Her landlord was at the door with \"three burly chaps\" as she described them, looking to remove her from her home.  Needless to say he got short shrift.  Imagine sitting in your house and seeing them coming up your driveway.  What do you tell the children?<\/p> <p> The Government has no concept of the consequences of its actions.  I often say it is easy to know that nobody belonging them has to experience anything like this.  Nobody belonging to them has to apply to be on a housing list either, certainly not in Kildare where it takes three months to be processed and with almost 7,000 people on this list with a ten to 12-year waiting period  God help us if you are single.  It is a landlord's paradise and it is no wonder they rock up with private security in tow.<\/p> <p> The solution to this is a common-sense one.  Build public housing on public land and put a stop to private security companies turning up at the doors of our most vulnerable.  If someone is to be evicted, there are proper channels in place to do so and this is not one of them.  There needs to be stronger protection for the family home in the Constitution.  The Government is always harping on about property rights for landlords but what about everybody else?

As I have just jogged up the quays, I have done all my exercise for the day to get back here in time.<\/p>  <p>  This is important legislation.  We have all seen a number of horrible and unsavoury evictions take place in recent years where private security personnel have arrived at people's doors.  The whole area has been largely unregulated until now and this Bill proposes to bring a whole umbrella of regulation under the Private Security Authority and to increase certain powers under that legislation in order that licences to operate private security firms can be revoked.  That is important because I have seen it happen only once or twice in my constituency and I will not get into the cases because it will make them identifiable.  However, there have been a number of headline cases around the country.<\/p>  <p>  Another thing that needs to be looked at in how these firms operate is how they present themselves at someone's door.  We have seen them masked or wearing balaclavas and that is the height of intimidation.  There are certain organisations in the country that wear balaclavas as a form of illegal and subversive uniform.  When one is carrying out actions on behalf of the judicial system of our land in executing a court order, one should present oneself on a person's driveway or at a person's front door in a face-to-face and transparent manner.  That is really important.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation is being backed by the Government.  The sooner we can bring in regulation the better because people need to know that the people they are transacting with are kosher and above board.  A number of our national tabloid newspapers have undertaken certain expos&eacute; stories on some of these private security firms and the backgrounds of some of these individuals.  There needs to be a lot of time devoted to ensuring they are fully Garda-vetted and that appropriate and upstanding people are taking on these roles.  We do not want thugs or gurriers donning uniforms and masks and arriving at someone's door.  This is fulfilling a court order execution and we need to have competent and professional people who are regulated.  That is, above all, what this Bill seeks to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200039#RR00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1620828300,"counter":328,"content":"<p>We are talking about ensuring that those acting on behalf of the banks, vulture funds and other financial institutions are tightly controlled and cannot do as they please when taking property back from those who find themselves in financial trouble.  While this is welcome, I have to point out that we are dealing with ensuring there is control of these private security firm workers and not the financial industry that benefits, no matter what happens.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the very people who find themselves in financial trouble may well have had to contend with the loose controls enjoyed by the financial industry before they ever parted with their money or sought a loan.  Those may be the people who were forced to bid well above the asking price for the property because of the ability given to vulture funds to inflate house prices, increase rents and give people little choice but to put themselves under undue financial pressure.  They may be the people who, before they acquired their homes, had to deal with damp and overpriced housing that was not fit for them or their children.  Those are the people who have finally found somewhere they thought was secure but they are also the people who, like many in my constituency, received the awful news that they must leave their homes and sign up to our infamous housing waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  While the measures in this Bill are needed, what is really required is action that prevents vulture funds or the privileged from hiking house prices and causing soaring rents.  We need a housing policy that takes the sense of hopelessness away from those on our long local authority housing lists.  Without this we will continue to have young families being terrified that they will have nowhere else to go or having to settle for substandard accommodation for them and their children.  While I support this Bill, we must ask why the Government will not at the same time deal with the challenges faced by families up and down the country when it comes to finding a home.  It is worth noting that we are discussing this Bill at a pivotal time.  When this pandemic eases, there is no doubt but that the extent of the debt and mortgage arrears people have been forced into will be exposed.  These people will need protection.  That is why we are discussing the regulation of those working with the enforcement agencies.<\/p>  <p>  Following the incidents in Strokestown, County Roscommon and on North Frederick Street, Dublin, Sinn F&eacute;in's Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire pointed to the shortcomings in the regulation of security companies and tried to get the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to address it.  Unfortunately, the former Minister was slow in dealing with this and therefore Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire and Martin Kenny introduced the Regulation of Private Security Firms Bill 2019, which sought to regulate private security companies engaging in the enforcement of court orders, including in the repossession of properties.  The Government supported this Bill in November of 2019 on the basis that the Government's Bill would progress without delay.  Here we are 18 months later finally discussing it.<\/p>  <p>  We must remember that every time people lose their homes, whether those homes are purchased or rented, their futures are uncertain.  They may have families to look after or health concerns to deal with.  They do not need the indignity of heavy-handed techniques being used against them.  They need some certainty that their needs will not be forgotten by the State and that they will not end up homeless or living in unsuitable accommodation.  We must ensure that our people are protected in getting suitable accommodation, not just in being removed from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200039#RR00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1620828900,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the publication by the Government of the Private Security Services (Amendment) Bill 2021.  It is long overdue.  I recognise and acknowledge the work and contribution of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in the initial drafting of the Bill some time ago.  I am heartened by the fact there is cross-party support for it.  There is good reason for that support.  I am happy to say that I will support the passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il for all of the reasons I will outline.  It is something the public wants and needs.  The public needs to have confidence in the private security industry.  The events a number of years ago in North Frederick Street in Dublin and Strokestown in Roscommon show that it is very important to have a regulated security industry in this country.  Those forced and violent evictions should never be allowed recur in this country.<\/p><p>The next reason I am supporting the Bill is because it is something the private security industry itself wants.  To be fair to the industry, it operates to quite a high standard in this country.  The very last thing it wants is for unlicensed, unidentified, untrained and masked individuals being bussed into this jurisdiction to perform very violent evictions and undermine the reputation of the industry.<\/p><p>Another reason I am supporting the Bill is because it sets up, defines and establishes a new grade and category of security professional, namely, the enforcement guard, and this is a good thing.  Once we define the role of a new category or a new grade, we will get to control the role.  We can be sure, or at least confident, that anybody getting into this line of work will be properly Garda vetted, will be the subject of background checks and will be properly licensed and trained. The training aspect is very important.  It is not just about having the right skill set, it is also about having the right mindset.  To be fair, being forcibly evicted from a home or property is devastating for anyone.  The day of an eviction is one that people will remember for the rest of their lives.  Let us not make it any more difficult than it already is.  It is important that if a court order is being enforced, it is done in a very sensitive and professional manner.  To be fair, the legislation facilitates this happening.<\/p><p>I am also supporting the Bill because it provides a mechanism for members of the public to make formal complaints to the regulator in the event of misdemeanours or misbehaviour by this new grade of security professional.  It also creates the new offence of impersonating an enforcement guard, whereby people who are not licensed, properly trained or regulated pretend to be someone they are not.  The appropriate penalties are there from a fines perspective and even from a custodial sentence perspective <i>in extremis<\/i>.<\/p><p>Forced evictions, or the enforcement of court orders, should absolutely be regarded as a measure of last resort.  We should absolutely explore and exhaust every other avenue possible to prevent forced evictions from occurring.  It is beyond the scope of the Bill but I am still concerned, as are many Deputies, about the cost of mortgage rates in this country.  They are twice the EU average, which is completely unacceptable.  There is just not enough competition in the banking sector here.  With KBC and Ulster Bank leaving the market, a huge vacuum is being left behind.  We need to empower the credit union movement and An Post to fill this vacuum and provide fair mortgages at fair rates.<\/p><p>We should also encourage continental banks to operate here at fair rates.  There should be no reason an Irish person cannot get a mortgage from a bank in Germany in respect of an Irish property.  The latter happens in other EU countries.  There is no reason it should not happen here.  We are told there are four freedoms in the European Union.  These are freedom of movement, freedom of capital, freedom of goods and freedom of services.  It is fortuitous that the EU Commissioner for Financial Services, financial stability and Capital Markets Unionis an Irishwoman, Mairead McGuinness.  For the next few years, this is an opportunity we should certainly seize and try to get more competition into the market, reduce the mortgage rates in this country to allow people to stay in their homes and reduce the chances of forced evictions in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200040#SS00100","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1620828900,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to properly regulate private security services.  This is an area that has gone unregulated for far too long.  Banks and financial services firms have pretty much been able to hire who they want to do their dirty work of evicting the people who bailed them out during the financial crisis.  Many in this House remember the shameful, violent eviction of three siblings from a property in Strokestown, County Roscommon, by a private security firm hired by KBC.  In the lead up to Christmas 2018, KBC ordered the eviction of three siblings from their property.  It hired a private security firm from Antrim, headed by an ex-UDR soldier, who, in the words of a colleague, thought he was Rambo.  The actions of the security firm resulted in multiple people being left injured, a dog killed, several cars burned out and the siblings left suicidal.  The siblings were dragged from their house by the security team and assaulted.  Two elderly sisters were left on the roadside.  The site was turned into a war zone.  The company was ordered to pay fines of &euro;3,000 for its gross misconduct during the eviction.  This is the cost of no regulation.  Ordinary people are left vulnerable to the activities of the worst of actors.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, Dublin City Council issued a tender for a seven-days-a-week private security firm to deal with Traveller evictions.  Quite rightly, many Traveller communities and representative organisations were concerned about private security firms, particularly in the wake of the events at Strokestown and the hostility of many Government representatives to Travellers in general.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, while garda&iacute; looked on, a private security firm evicted tenants from a property in Dublin without a court order.  One Garda is reported to have said it was not their responsibility if the person was homeless.  Subsequently, the tenants were able to regain access to the property after the eviction.  The eviction by the firm led to significant damage to the property, which was left in an uninhabitable condition.<\/p>  <p>  A large number of these types of situations are happening throughout the country.  There are many people in mortgage distress. many businesses in insolvency and many people who have spent their whole lives, their blood, sweat and tears and their investments on keeping a business, farm or home afloat.  These people have been removed from their properties on many occasions by individuals who have no respect for humanity, no respect for the rule of law and no decency whatsoever.  There is not a Deputy in the House who has not had decent individuals in their constituencies tell them these horrifying stories.  The fact it has been let go unchecked for so long is incredible.<\/p>  <p>  While I am speaking on this issue, I want to say that it is hard to separate it from what is happening in the housing crisis in general.  The sector we are discussing is one that is feeding off the dysfunction relating to the housing sector.  This week, we have seen many Government Deputies and Ministers feign shock at what is happening in the housing sector.  It amazes me that they do this because they were the willing architects of the housing market we have at present.  They put in the tax breaks for the international investors to hoover up homes from first-time buyers in the sector.  These political parties and Deputies rolled out the red carpet for many of the international investors who are now fighting a David versus Goliath battle each day for homes throughout the country.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are the architects of a market that pits small families against big international firms that have a massive competitive advantage over them.  Those firms are availing of interest rates of 0% on the international markets while homeowners and families here pay the highest interest rates for mortgages in the European Union.<\/p> <p>These investors have tax rates that would not be given to people on low incomes in this country, even though they make millions of euro.  It was done so by Fine Gael.  I remember asking Michael Noonan, the former Minister for Finance, in a committee how could he allow this to happen and he said that the house prices in this country are not dear enough.  At the time, the Labour Party supported that.  Fianna F&aacute;il supported it subsequently from the Opposition benches in its confidence and supply agreement and is standing by, feigning shock today.<\/p> <p> Another key element in the dysfunction of the housing market has to be the dysfunction of the banking sector.  One of the reasons developers in this country currently cannot get the finances necessary to take on some of these projects is because we have a banking crisis in Ireland of mammoth proportions that is affecting nearly every element of society.  This crisis is also the design of Fine Gael.  I remember Mr. Noonan, the previous Minister for Finance, launching in the D&aacute;il this idea of a two-pillar bank market.  Those two banks own most of the market.  They are an oligopoly.  They have enormous supplier power.  They can determine every element of the market and they are doing that.  The few competitors left are fleeing the market.  Ulster Bank and KBC have given notice that they are on the way out and yet we have nothing more than shrugs from the Government with regards what needs to be done in relation to fixing the dysfunctional banking market - a banking market that leads to the highest interest rates in Europe, that leads to people not being able to get funding for the development of homes and leads to other sectors of society not being able to be funded as well.<\/p> <p> A number of colleagues from other political parties and I are seeking the development by the Government of a banking forum.  It would be made up of stakeholders in that sector such as the trade unions that work in the banking system, first and foremost, but also trade unions in general, small businesses, representatives of farmers and representatives of rural areas.  We seek the getting together of a forum before the year is out to make sure that we can design a functioning banking market.  Primary to that objective that we have is that there would be a public banking system created.  I refer to a public banking system that pretty much every political party in this Chamber says it supports.  Currently, the only party that is against it is Fine Gael.  I am hopeful that this motion will be passed at committees across Leinster House and that we can build momentum towards a proper public banking system.  I have been talking to colleagues from other political parties and this is not an effort to nationalise the banking system.  This is an effort to have a diverse banking system that has good, strong private firms operating within the market but also has strong public banks, strong credit unions and post offices operating in this market so that there is competition.  That is necessary.<\/p> <p> When we talk about the issue before the House of private security firms and the need for their regulation, Aont&uacute; supports that 100%.  However, it is a symptom of a greater malaise within Irish society.  It is a malaise that is the construct of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, albeit one about which they feign amazement that it exists at all and one to which they provide nothing but shrugs as a solution to resolving it.  I support this Bill but call on the Government to get to the bottom of the housing crisis.  If they do not, they will create a tenant class in this country the likes of which has not been seen since the time of the landlords, a tenant class where those in their 20s, 30s and 40s are straddled with rents so high that they will never be able to afford a mortgage, and a system whereby there is a transfer of wealth continuously happening from families to massive international firms spreading that concentration of wealth into the hands of the few.  It is incredible that we stand here, hopefully, at the ending of the Covid pandemic, yet we are saying to this generation that it is the first generation in hundreds of years that will be poorer and less well off than the generation that went before.  That is the wrong message that Leinster House gives out.  We need to reverse that message.  We need to be serious about putting in place the mechanisms to create real competition in the banking market and real competition in the housebuilding market, to take the competitive advantages away from the international firms and to improve the competitive advantages of the young families who are trying to get onto the housing market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200040#SS00200","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620829500,"counter":332,"content":"<p>This Bill cannot be taken in isolation.  It is a Bill that is being supported by the House but it is a reflection on what is happening within the banking sector and in the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  In 2008, when we had the crash and things got very bad after that, the banks quickly showed how greedy they were and how unrelenting they were in relation to repossessions, chasing people and, in many cases, breaking them down.  Some died by suicide.  We cannot overlook that.  I would say to the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, that following the passing of this Bill, we need to reflect on the receivers.  What action the receivers have taken against individuals on behalf of the bank needs to be examined in great detail.  Locks have been changed.  Rents have been taken and disposed of in a way that was not in line with any agreement.  Some properties were taken and the owners were not even aware that receivers had moved in.  I do not want to paint all receivers with the one brush but we have a serious problem with that sector in the context of regulation and accountability and there is nobody whose property they have taken who has been able to get that accountability and to ensure that his or her rights were protected and upheld.  Because it has taken so long to bring this legislation before the House, it concerns me that we will have to wait a further length of time to regulate receivers and to bring them to account.  I urge the Minister of State to look at the history of what has happened in the State since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister of State even listens to the language that is being used today, we seem to take evictions now as being the normal.  They are not normal.  Evictions were created out of poor debt management by those who are in arrears but they were unable, as lay litigants, to take on the might of the banks which steamrolled through the courts system and almost were supported by the courts system in terms of appointment of receivers and ignoring the rights of the individual.  We cannot allow that to continue to happen.  We have to restore the rights to those individuals and we have to ensure that there is a mechanism to keep them in their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  Banks have not changed from 2008.  In fact, now that they are getting up on their feet and trading again, they are treating customers and those in arrears extremely badly and they are then looking to the courts.  The Bill that was passed here in this House regarding hearsay evidence is a further example of how we have armed the banks with the necessary tools to treat people badly.  If we are to level the playing field, we have to ensure that each bank would keep its loans, would work with the person or family that is in arrears and would ensure that it is only at the end that they would find a solution of mortgage-to-rent or, indeed, involve the voluntary sector and those not-for-profit organisations that are providing a way out for those who are in such difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to look to the courts.  For the courts to appoint receivers and to behave the way they have, is absolutely appalling.<\/p> <p>We have seen examples of the use of security firms that should never have been allowed in this country and not just the ones that have already been mentioned.  They blackguarded people - individuals, families and business people - who had decent incomes and businesses and who were trying to do their best in hard times only to be chased by banks and receivers and then to be confronted at their own front door by individuals in uniforms and balaclavas.  Where in the name of God would you see it?  How did we let it happen?  That is what the State has to ask itself.  Why has the State not put forward the strongest possible legislation to protect its own citizens?  We have seen too many examples of the State itself beating up its own citizens and depriving them of their rights which gives licence to some, but not all, private security companies to act improperly.  The minute someone wants to achieve the repossession of a property or to damage a business, then people come in who hide their faces and do the dirty work on behalf of receivers and banks.<\/p> <p> This all goes back to the housing crisis, our attitude towards family and community and proper acknowledgement of the rights of people in the context of difficulties they might be experiencing.  In 2008, the banks in this country brought us all down and we may have taken our eye off the ball in terms of the devastation that caused.  Let there be no doubt about it, the private security companies that engaged in evictions should have no licence whatsoever.  Their licence should be taken from them and we should have a strong regulatory system in place, with teeth, to deal with this.  We have too many regulators with no teeth, strength or muscle.  The side of the citizen must be strengthened as much as possible to ensure the type of bad practice we are discussing does not happen again.  I also encourage the Minister, following this debate, to look at receivers and how they behave.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200041#TT00200","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620830100,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire who pointed out in 2018 that there was insufficient or no regulation of some private security firms.  He brought that to the attention of the Minister for Justice and, along with Deputy Martin Kenny, he later introduced legislation on the matter.  In fairness, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, did not oppose it.  We can see that in this room and beyond, there is absolute agreement on the necessity for this legislation.  The two events that stick in our minds are those that happened in North Frederick Street in Dublin and Strokestown in County Roscommon.  The way that some private security personnel acted was absolutely scandalous.  It was utterly ridiculous and would remind one of pictures and scenes from the period of the Famine and the Land League.  Such scenes have absolutely no place in the Ireland of today and in that context we need this legislation to be done and dusted quickly.<\/p>  <p>  I concur with Deputy McGuinness that we need an entire regulatory system governing evictions and the unfortunate circumstances in which some people find themselves.  We all know of cases where the State or NGOs have delivered solutions, whether through approved housing bodies, AHBs, local authorities or mortgage-to-rent arrangements and we need to facilitate this wherever possible.  Like many others in this Chamber, I find it very difficult to decontextualise this or remove it from the wider question of the housing crisis.  If we are to see fewer evictions, we need not just regulation but a consistent, constant supply of right-priced houses and rental units.  We need a system that will deliver.  We all accept, across the board, that the housing policies and systems that have been in operation for many years have not delivered and are not fit to do so.  We must deal with issues like tax breaks for real estate investment trusts, REITs, which are certainly not delivering for regular people.  We must put a system in place that delivers.  The public system must do what is required.  We must invest money and build on public land.  We must provide cost rental, affordable mortgages and council housing options.  Beyond that, we must create vehicles to allow private money to be invested in decent land deals that will produce proper developments for the people of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200042#UU00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1620830100,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on this legislation, although it is probably eight or ten years too late.  When the banking crisis hit, we saw the vulture funds arrive and we saw the mushrooming of the legal eagles and everybody else, no disrespect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  We saw what went on in the courts.  I have been present at so many evictions and my colleagues, Deputies Nolan and Michael Collins visited KBC Bank after the events at Strokestown.  We also visited a private security company in Tipperary with one Jerry Beades.<\/p>  <p>  It is the wild west when it comes to security and the intimidation that goes on and has gone on.  There is no place in this country for a third force.  I have said that dozens of times but we have a third force.  We have An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which I have proudly supported all of my life, and we have the Irish Army.  That is it, apart from the auxiliary force, the F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, FCA, as it was known in my time, or the Local Defence Force, LDF.  Then a third force arrived, a murky, dirty underworld of business.  These firms were meant to be regulated.  The regulator had offices in my own town of Tipperary and was doing its best but it was the wild west.  There was violence and intimidation.  Men wearing balaclavas and accompanied by dogs were crawling across fields in Wexford.  I was on the phone to the woman of the house who was standing at the gate of her farm and being pulled away.  I am sad to say that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were present but they turned their backs and I met the Chief Superintendent afterwards to complain.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation does not go far enough.  Some of the security personnel mentioned earlier were former members of the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR.  They came down here with their knuckle dusters, their heavies and all kinds of padding, to intimidate people.  We saw what happened in Balbriggan in Dublin and in other areas.  Vehicles were parked outside the Garda Station in Balbriggan.  There must be a separation of powers between the courts, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and these agents.  Many of them were thugs, vagabonds and heavies.  That language might be strong but that is what they were.  They had blackened faces and little respect for anybody.  Even in cases where garda&iacute; challenged them in some rural areas, they just pushed them out of the way.  It is dangerous when people get power like that and get away with it.  Nightclub bouncers or those providing security in pubs must be registered and wear bands on their arms.  We looked for badges on those people but they did not have them.  If we did not get out their way, we would have literally been blown into eternity.  I was standing on the roadside in Ferns, County Wexford, in Galway and in many other parts of the country to support people who were thrown on the mercy of vultures.<\/p>  <p>  On the vulture funds, the former Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, welcomed them into this country.  I heard what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said about Deputy Noonan welcoming them here and now we see the results of that.  We have an appalling mess because of all of the evictions, the hoarding and the over-stocking.  This Bill does not go far enough.  We need to regulate the security industry profoundly, the same as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When they call to someone's home, sometimes they do not have the eviction order documents at all and sometimes they do not have the court orders.  Sometimes they have photocopies and sometimes there are misspellings.  To be honest, many ordinary rank-and-file garda&iacute; do not understand the legal jargon, no more than I do myself.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would understand it but many garda&iacute; do not.  Many times, evictions are carried out without court sanction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021051200042#UU00300","speaker":"1612"}]
