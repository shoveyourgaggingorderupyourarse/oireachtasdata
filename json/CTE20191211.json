I am pleased to be joined by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive and senior HSE officials, and to have an opportunity to update the committee regarding current issues.<\/p> <p>   Regarding Sl&aacute;intecare, officials at my Department have been engaging with stakeholders to gain insights into what they want and expect from our health services.  One of the resounding messages to emerge is the need to have a clear and coherent plan.  Sl&aacute;intecare is now that plan.  I am pleased to say that the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is now well under way.  Planning and co-design for the new regional health areas has begun.  Co-design is an important part of Sl&aacute;intecare and means that patients and staff who live and work in the region play a part in setting up that regional structure.  Following consultation with the Sl&aacute;intecare office, I will make a recommendation to the Government on the exact structure of each region early in the new year.  <\/p> <p>  A forum to provide a regular platform for dialogue between the State and voluntary providers of health and social care services is also being set up.  It will have an overarching mandate to build a stronger relationship between the State and voluntary providers for the benefit of patients and service users.  The forum will meet for the first time in December.  I had an opportunity to address an initial meeting of that forum, and I thank Mr. Peter Cassells for agreeing to chair it.  The integration fund of &euro;20 million is supporting 122 projects across the country and, via that &euro;20 million, we will hire 300 additional staff to work in the community.  In each of the Deputies' constituencies, therefore, Sl&aacute;intecare projects are now up and running in each county delivering reform in health services on the ground in our communities.  <\/p> <p>  To reduce community waiting lists, an important and sensitive issue, we will spend &euro;60 million between now and 2021 to employ an additional 1,000 community healthcare staff by the end of 2020.  These will be people able to treat our citizens closer to home.  In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of primary care centres.  Some 127 primary care centres are open, but it is fair to make the point that we need to staff them better.  Deputy O'Reilly has made that point vigorously and regularly.  We have fine buildings and they are needed because they bring about a new and better way of working and new opportunities for our patients to access services locally.  We need to increase the staff in those facilities now, and that is what these 1,000 additional staff, the Sl&aacute;intecare workforce as I like to call them, are about as well.<\/p> <p>  I am acutely aware that along with any long-term plan, and we do need a long-term plan, we also need to address the issues facing us today.  I acknowledge the challenges facing accident and emergency departments in our hospitals and I accept that in some it is particularly difficult for our patients and staff.  The Government allocated a budget of an additional &euro;26 million to assist the HSE over the winter.  Specifically, this funding was to support and improve access to the fair deal scheme, helping our citizens to get into nursing homes quicker and to also provide additional homecare, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion.  <\/p> <p>  Specific funding has been allocated to local winter action teams to support initiatives at local level.  This is important.  Everything cannot just be about the Department of Health, the HSE and Dr. Steevens' Hospital deciding what individual areas are doing.  This process has to be about resourcing and empowering local winter action teams to enable them to respond to issues as they arise in their regions.  I am pleased to confirm a range of new and additional measures to alleviate pressures on accident and emergency departments.  The HSE has reached an agreement with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to open up to 190 extra hospital beds in the coming weeks.  When we factor in these 190 extra beds with the 40 additional beds in the modular unit in Clonmel, due to open in the new year, that brings us to a total of 230 additional hospital beds that will open between now and the start of 2020.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, the NTPF has written to each hospital groups and, as of today, I confirm that 83 beds have now approved, of the overall 190 beds.  These additional beds are in Letterkenny, Tullamore, Waterford, Cork, the national children's hospital and Limerick, in St. John's Hospital.<\/p><p>It is a matter that Senator Kieran O'Donnell has pursued with me as well.<\/p><p> The NTPF is continuing to engage with hospital groups to finalise the details of the additional capacity but the message is very simple.  If a hospital has opportunities to open additional capacity in its facilities, a nearby hospital or a level 2 or level 3 hospital, we will look at how we can fund that through the NTPF.  I commend both the NTPF and the HSE on the collaborative way they are working in this regard.  There are 230 additional hospital beds, including the Clonmel modular unit, and it is a very significant increase in capacity on top of the &euro;26 million already provided.<\/p><p> I confirm that in the coming week, I will sign a new statutory instrument to reduce the cost of attendance at a minor injury unit to &euro;75.  For many years, people have commented on the fact that it seems a little bizarre that we are trying to encourage people to attend a minor injury unit if it is the appropriate place to go but the cost of going to the minor injury unit was the same as the cost of going to an accident and emergency department.  That is &euro;100 if a person does not have a medical card.  In an effort to further incentivise use of our minor injury units, I have decided to reduce the cost to &euro;75.  That statutory instrument is currently being legally drafted and I expect to be able to sign it in the coming week.  I know the HSE will then implement it with immediate effect.  It will also provide an opportunity locally in the 11 minor injury units across the country to reinforce the importance of using the minor injury unit where we know people can be in and out in 90 minutes, two hours or even less time for many conditions.  That is without needing to go to the accident and emergency department, which is good news.<\/p><p> I am also working with Government colleagues to identify some additional funding for more social care supports on top of what we have already done.  There is &euro;26 million already in a winter plan and additional money is going to the HSE for the NTPF to open more beds; this relates to the 190 additional beds and the 40 beds in Clonmel.  On top of that I expect to be in the position within the next week to make further announcements on additional funding for extra support for home care, transitional care and some very good and innovative ideas that HSE colleagues have been working on at a hospital group level in recent days and weeks.  I wanted to update the committee on those new measures to try to provide additional assistance to our health service at what is a very busy time.<\/p><p> We have seen significant progress on waiting times for scheduled care.  It is not often heard or articulated but we should be clear that as a result of increased activity and the ongoing work between the HSE and the NTPF, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure - a hospital operation or procedure - fell to 66,594 in November from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.  Month on month we are seeing in this country the number of people waiting for a hospital operation falling and the number of people having their hospital operation in less than three months is increasing.  Approximately 32% of people were getting their hospital operation in three months or less in 2017 and that figure is now 42%.  More than four in ten of us are now getting a hospital operation in 12 weeks or less, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare target.  We must build on that and increase the 42% figure even further.  We have seen an overall reduction of 23% in the number of people waiting for a hospital procedure.  The number of patients waiting more than three months has fallen by 21,400, or 37%, from July 2017 to November 2019.  There are fewer people waiting for a hospital operation and more people are being seen more quickly in connection with that operation.  There are fewer people waiting longer for such hospital operations as well.<\/p><p> We speak of waiting lists as if they are part of a global conversation but we can consider some of the specialties.  Ophthalmology relates to the treatment of eyes and the number of people waiting over three months for a procedure in this area fell by 63% from July 2017 to the end of November 2019.  In the ear, nose and throat specialty, the number of people waiting over three months for a procedure fell by 58% from 2017 to 2019.  The number of people waiting over three months for a cardiology procedure fell by 33%.  The world and its mother knows there are major challenges in our health services but it is important to acknowledge the progress being made by very hard-working staff, coupled with significant investment from the Government, in decreasing waiting times for hospital operations or procedures.<\/p><p> The key must now be our outpatients.  We need to consider how we can drive down the length of time people are waiting to see a hospital consultant.  That is why we will use a significant amount of the additional resources being provided to the NTPF to put in place further targeted measures in this regard.  We have seen the outpatient waiting list fall for three months in a row and we will see it fall for four months in a row.<\/p><p>For the first time in a long time the number of people waiting to see a hospital consultant is falling month on month, although it is still far too high.  My conversations with consultants will focus on how additional money for them will be about reforming how they work and how we make sure that public patients are not continually pushed to the bottom of hospital queues over those who can afford to pay for private health insurance.  We will be working with the HSE, the NTPF and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office to produce plans for 2020 that will build on the progress that has been made to date.  We are working to identify initiatives that will meet the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This is not the bad old days of the NTPF turfing out money to private hospitals.  Any initiative funded through the NTPF in 2020 must meet the Sl&aacute;intecare objectives and must include innovative approaches to increase activity, avoid hospital attendances and better utilise our smaller hospitals and our primary care centres.  The NTPF is not the NTPF of the Celtic tiger, when it was just a funding pot for private hospitals.  It must be used as an access fund for the public health service as well.  <\/p><p> A key focus for 2020 will be on moving care to more appropriate settings.  We have a number of specialties working in this regard, including ENT, orthopaedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, urology and gynaecology.  There are significant opportunities to make progress in those areas in 2020.  We will also be seeking to maximise the use of advanced nursing practitioners.  The days of everything being done by the doctor is an outdated model.  We have extremely well-qualified nurses in this country and advanced nurse practitioners who can lead clinics and provide entire episodes of care.  We also have physiotherapists who can manage orthopaedic clinics and people who can provide ophthalmology services in the community.  This extra funding must be about reform as well.<\/p><p> I would like to comment briefly on the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, aggregate report on cervical cancer and the CervicalCheck programme.  As the committee will be aware, on Tuesday, 3 December, I published the aggregate report of the independent expert panel review led by RCOG.  The committee will have an opportunity to discuss the report in detail on 18 December, when it will hear from both patient advocates and the college.  I do not intend to fill either of those spaces but it would be remiss of me not to make some comment.<\/p><p> I thank the expert panel who conducted this review and, in particular, all of the women and their next-of-kin who agreed to participate in it through the examination of the performance of the CervicalCheck programme.  The findings and conclusions contained in the review provide reassurance and, I hope, assist in restoring confidence in our programme and address its importance and quality, while also highlighting the sad and painful reality of the limitations of all of our screening programmes.  RCOG was asked to do this body of work for two reasons.  First, we felt, and rightly so, that the women of Ireland who had had cervical cancer deserved to have an independent clinical review of their screening history.  Second, the Government and I, as Minister for Health, wanted to be able to answer the questions that women were asking at a very difficult time for our screening service, namely, \"Can I have confidence in our screening programme?\" and \"Is our screening programme working effectively?\".  The good news is that the report finds that the CervicalCheck programme is working effectively and, crucially, that women can have confidence in the programme.  As I said earlier, the committee will have an opportunity next week to tease through the report in much greater detail with RCOG.  The key conclusions of the expert panel are that the CervicalCheck programme has undoubtedly saved the lives of many of those who participated in the review, that the programme is working effectively and that women can have confidence in it.<\/p><p> The panel emphasises that it is important to recognise the serious impact that screening failures have on the lives of women and their families.  Cervical cancer is a disgusting and devastating disease that disproportionately affects younger women.  It takes the lives of approximately 100 Irishwomen every year.  Some 300 women will get a diagnosis of cervical cancer each year.  Screening, in every country in the world, inevitably will have limitations.  There are limitations when it comes to cytology-based screening but this should not be taken to suggest the programme overall is not working.  As Minister, I have to reference the importance of the programme and how effectively it is working but that is not to in any way not acknowledge the significant pain and trauma of those who have cervical cancer and those who have been caught up in this awful debacle in regard to the non-disclosure of an audit.  If we are to achieve our goal of making cervical cancer a rare disease in this country, effectively eradicating it within a generation in Ireland, it is vital that women continue to attend for screening and that we continue to build on the considerable progress in other areas over the course of this year.  Smear test turnaround times, an issue on which I have been rightly scrutinised at this committee on many occasions, has stabilised.  I thank the staff of CervicalCheck and the HSE for their incredible work in this regard.  Implementation of Dr. Scally's recommendations is well under way.<\/p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, which is only weeks away, we will move to HPV primary screening, becoming one of the first countries in the world to do so.  I have written to the HSE to ask it to consider the recommendations from the review in the context of this crucial project to ensure it absolutely is delivered by the end of the first quarter of 2020.  I know it absolutely will be.<\/p><p> I am also pleased we have put in place another key element in restoring trust and confidence not just in screening but in our health service.  This is the patient safety Bill, which committee members will scrutinise here and in the D&aacute;il.  It will commence in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  It will bring about mandatory open disclosure.  As Dr. Scally said, when things go wrong in the health service, people want a sincere and genuine apology.  They want to know there is an understanding of what happened and an assurance it will not happen again.  The patient safety Bill will focus on open disclosure and will signal a new era for the health service.  The legislation will establish a robust and future-proofed framework for mandatory open disclosure.  Importantly, it will require notification of serious patient safety incidents to the external regulator, be it HIQA or the Mental Health Commission.  No doubt, this will contribute to national patient safety learning and improvement.<\/p><p> Importantly, mandatory open disclosure will apply not just to the public health service but also to the private health service.  For the first time we will extend the remit of HIQA to the private health service.  The new patient safety Bill places clear responsibilities and obligations on health service providers to ensure mandatory open disclosure occurs and external notification to the regulator takes place.  It is a significant cultural and legal change.<\/p><p> I understand the committee is interested in the care of women who have been affected by the use of mesh implants.  I have met the mesh survivors group on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 November, and I have listened to their personal stories.  I acknowledge very sincerely Deputy O'Reilly's work in this regard as an advocate and, perhaps, and interlocutor on occasion, for the advocacy group with the Government and the Department.  I acknowledge the very constructive way she has put forward their case and engaged with me.  I want to be very clear that I am fully committed to ensuring that all women who develop mesh related complications receive high-quality, multidisciplinary and patient-centred care.<\/p><p> Since the issue came to my attention in late 2017, an ongoing priority focus for the Department and the HSE has been to understand the clinical and technical issues and to put in place the necessary structures for, and the provision of, care for women who have been affected by the use of mesh.  It is very clear to me when I meet the women and hear their stories the trauma, pain and agony they have been put through.  Quite frankly, there has been physical agony and mental anguish.  I requested the chief medical officer to do a body of work.  He thoroughly examined the issue and prepared a report for me on the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures and responding to women experiencing mesh complications.  We published the report in November last year.  It includes a number of significant recommendations in a number of key areas.  It also put a pause on the use of mesh in Ireland until we get to a point when we can be satisfied that all of the recommendations have been met.  The HSE has advised that a package of care is now available for women who have been identified with urgent or immediate needs.  In addition, the HSE's service plan will ensure the continued implementation of the chief medical officer's report on transvaginal mesh as a priority action.  We are also continuing to progress the delivery of care pathways for women, including a specialist, multidisciplinary national mesh complications service.<\/p><p> I am also looking at the issue of access to medical cards.  I had a very good discussion with the group and Deputy O'Reilly about whether we can provide a medical card in circumstances where somebody has been through the service and an identified issue has been established.  I believe we can make progress.  I have been asked to put in place a process for the voices of women to be heard and I have made a commitment to do this.  We are developing proposals on an independent compassionate process for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard.  I have written to Mesh Survivors Ireland in this regard.  Work is under way.  I am happy to deal with any questions in this regard.<\/p><p> I do not underestimate the significant challenges our health service faces but I do not accept that everything in the health service is bad or in crisis.  Every day our staff do an excellent job of providing high-quality care to many people.  We are making progress when it comes to waiting lists.  Today, I announced a significant number of measures on additional capacity in the health service and additional resources for the winter.  We will build further on this in the days and weeks ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#D00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms. Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, and Mr. Liam Woods, national director for acute operations.<\/p> <p>  The latest financial position, from the end of the third quarter, shows a variance from budget, including first charge, of &euro;319 million, or 3%.<\/p><p>Of this, &euro;119 million or 37% is in respect of our operational service areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was almost 100% higher at &euro;636 million, with &euro;507 million of that overrun, or 80%, in the operational service areas.  Pension and demand-led areas account for &euro;200 million of the variance as of September 2019.<\/p><p> A key priority for the HSE is to maximise the provision of safe services to the people we serve while operating within the funding provided to us.  This continues to be a significant challenge in the context of the ever-increasing level of demand for our services.  This demand is influenced by factors such as a growing population, an ageing demographic, changes in technology and clinical practice, as well as ongoing societal and economic change.  We have continued with our intensive focus on current year financial management and financial planning for 2020.  Senior managers across the organisation have been engaging with us regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services are in respect of providing residential placements to people with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialist emergency care within the acute hospital setting, particularly in the context of an ageing population with increasingly complex needs.  The costs within our pensions and demand-led areas are in the main driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic environment and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  State Claims Agency reimbursements are also within this area, and there is a significant and ongoing focus on mitigating, in so far as is practical, the underlying risks and issues that give rise to claims.<\/p><p> A key focus for our ongoing financial management efforts has been on improving compliance with our pay and staffing controls, including whole-time equivalents, WTEs, agency and overtime.  Although staffing levels will increase again in 2019, any increases must be managed in a way that is both planned and affordable.  This necessary adjustment to the controls on pay and staffing is proving difficult but it must become part of our normal way of working.  I acknowledge that this is a challenging process, but I and the board are committed to ensuring that there is an improved culture of delivery within the funding provided by the State.  I fully believe that this will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which ultimately will be in the best interest of our service users and their families.<\/p><p> My monthly financial meetings with community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and hospital group CEOs will continue to year end.  All areas are very clear about their allocated financial limits and performance expectations up to year end to mitigate in so far as practical any deviations from those limits, thereby reducing the extent of any challenge to be dealt with in 2020.  The discipline of these monthly financial meetings will continue throughout 2020.  Indeed, I met all the hospital group CEOs and CHOs just yesterday.  The HSE's national service plan for 2020 was adopted by the HSE board and submitted to the Minister for consideration.  The approval process is well advanced and I expect that the plan will be published within the next week.<\/p><p> The Minister has made some comments on winter planning.  Following on from the briefing provided to the committee in September of this year on winter preparedness planning, the HSE has prepared a detailed winter plan, which was launched in November.  The plan clearly reflects the year-on-year growth in demand for unscheduled care services that is growing at a rate of in excess of 5% in attendances and 2.7% in admissions over a mean annual population growth of 1.7%.  In response to this increased demand, an additional &euro;26 million has been provided to year end to fund a combination of nationally and locally managed initiatives aimed at improving overall patient flow from community, through the acute hospital and back into the community.<\/p><p> A sum of &euro;19.2 million from this funding is specifically focused on egress initiatives, including home care packages, improving access to the nursing home support scheme or fair deal, and transitional care beds for patients awaiting nursing home places.  The initiatives have in fact been in place since October in preparation for the anticipated winter surge and have enabled the system to respond.  Nine local winter action teams are in place and are co-chaired by the relevant community healthcare organisation chief officer and their hospital group CEO colleagues.<\/p><p> The balance of &euro;6.8 million has been distributed on the basis of population associated with each of the winter action teams, and this is funding initiatives such as enhanced community intervention teams; additional frailty intervention therapy teams, FITTs; aids and appliances to assist in discharge; enhanced triage capability; and additional bed capacity in private facilities.  The HSE at national level and at winter action team level is also engaged with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in providing enhanced access to diagnostics, which will improve overall patient experience times and alleviate pressure in the emergency department and wider hospital services.<\/p><p>On Sl&aacute;intecare, the HSE and the Department of Health continue to engage and work collaboratively on its implementation.  A key element of this work is service redesign to plan for the implementation of the new regional health regions and social care delivery structures.  In parallel with this work, I have also commenced a review of the HSE staffing and structures at the centre of the organisation as part of the preparatory work to inform the service redesign for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused national centre.<\/p><p> I mention employment levels and recruitment.  In October 2019, our overall employment levels stand at 138,080 personnel, equating to 119,473 whole-time equivalents, WTEs.  This represents a total growth in our employment levels this year of 1,616 WTEs and year-on-year growth from October of last year of 2,562 WTEs.  Our continued growth is important in the context of our overarching pay and numbers strategy.  We have filled and continue to fill approved and funded development posts in order to maintain and enhance key services for patients and their families.  In parallel, we are working to ensure levels of agency, overtime and pay costs, which reached unaffordable levels by the end of 2018, are brought within what is affordable and sustainable during 2019 and into 2020.  We have continued to grow our workforce, and year-on-year the largest of this growth in WTE terms, is in our staff categories of nursing and midwifery and patient and client care, which predominantly concerns healthcare assistant staff, with both categories showing growth of 650 WTEs and 646 WTEs, respectively.  In percentage terms, our largest year-on-year workforce growth is in our medical and dental staff category, which has seen a 3.7% increase since October last year.  Similarly, it is also the largest staff category growth in percentage terms this year to date at 3.4% growth.  Notably within these figures, our consultant workforce has grown by 142 WTEs year-on-year, with 135 WTEs of this increase recruited since January 2019.  As we draw to a close in 2019, we will continue to proceed with the approved and funded development posts in tandem with the requirement to keep within an affordable funding level that is sustainable both in 2019 and 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>We will open the discussion to members, starting with Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here this morning.  I would like to start locally with Purple House Cancer Support in Bray.  It is an incredible cancer support service that the Minister for Health and I know well.  It supports families and cancer survivors all over Wicklow and in south Dublin.  It has to leave the premises it is in on an extremely urgent basis.  It has found a fantastic premises that will allow it to expand its services and it looked for &euro;650,000 from the State with a view to doing matched funding.  After conversations with the Minister, staff from Purple House Cancer Support have told me that figure came down to about &euro;400,000.  They told me they met the Minister twice and he made promises around that amount of money.  They then said the amount promised dropped from about &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000 down to &euro;150,000 and that yesterday they got a letter which one of the Minister's team took them through.  That letter made no reference to any amount of money, it said there would be no money in 2019 and that they could apply for capital funding in 2020 but that would be considered in the round with a lot of other applications.  This is what the staff in Purple House Cancer Support have said to me.  I know the Minister and I both support this service.  Will the Minister deliver on the promise of around &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000?

I also know all the other cancer support groups across our county well and I also know that in my time as Minister, the level of annual funding for Purple House Cancer Support has significantly increased by &euro;100,000.  It now receives annual funding of &euro;175,000 and no other cancer support group in County Wicklow receives such funding.  I am sure the Deputy's concern for cancer patients in Bray is shared by a concern he would have for Greystones Cancer Support, Arklow Cancer Support, West Wicklow Cancer Support and Wicklow Cancer Support.  When one is Minister for Health, one is Minister for the whole country and one is a Deputy for one's whole constituency.  I have worked with Deputies in this committee on these matters.  For example, I have worked with Deputy Kelly to secure funding for Tipperary Cancer Support Centre and there is a process to go through.  Funding can be provided for Purple House Cancer Support and I have engaged with my Secretary General and the HSE on this matter.<\/p><p>That funding will assist Purple House Cancer Support in finding a new premises and I have had discussions with its representatives in that regard.  I do not relate all the discussions I have with my constituents, although of course my constituents can do that, but I believe that funding can be found.  I have had significant conversations with officials in the HSE and my Department about that matter.<\/p><p> I am also very much aware, as is the Deputy, of the rules on procurement and governance and that business cases and valuation reports are needed.  The letter that was shared yesterday with Purple House Cancer Support in an effort to be helpful provides some useful information on the next steps that need to be taken.  For example, the letter specifically states that while Purple House Cancer Support has produced a business case, it has not made a formal submission for capital funding.  The business case it has put together contains some of the information required but not all of the required documentation.  The letter included an offer that the local HSE estates office would assist with documentation and in completing the process.  It also made a number of other important points, including that the HSE would need a valuation report if taxpayers' money is to be spent.  The Deputy and I understand that.  If that were not the case, serious questions would be asked in the Committee of Public Accounts and other places.  <\/p><p> A technical report on the suitability of a building would also be needed.  It would be unusual to designate one building because generally, when one is spending taxpayers' money, one would look at a range of properties.  I am aware of the property concerned and the reason the group believes it is suitable, and I can see why that is the case.  My message to the Deputy and to Purple House Cancer Support is that we should work together on this.  I am more than happy to work with Deputy Donnelly.  We can make progress but there are rules, processes and procedures that need to be followed.  With the greatest of respect, a demand from the Deputy or anybody else issued through the local media is not how to bring about the spending of taxpayers' money.  That should be done by investing in good services and taking the very helpful advice provided yesterday by the chief officer of the HSE in the area in question on what would be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#J00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I have met representatives of Purple House Cancer Support and discussed this issue at length.

My understanding is that a letter issued to the Minister yesterday, which I presume he will receive at some point today, laying out the board's inability to do that.  The board will meet tomorrow week, or in eight days, to consider whether it can keep the facility open.  If there is no movement, the board may feel it has no choice but to withdraw from the deed of agreement with the NTPF.  That would mean that from 1 January there would be no fair deal funding for the fair deal residents in the facility.  While St. Joseph's would endeavour to keep the residents there for as long as possible, the reserves of the St. John of God organisation are gone and ultimately the residents would have to leave.  The situation is extremely urgent.  The Minister has repeatedly promised that what is about to happen should there be no intervention will not happen.  <\/p><p> I ask the Minister to consider the following two solutions.  A block grant needs to be provided for one to two years, or for an appropriate timeframe, to cover the gap between the NTPF amount, which is approximately &euro;1,350, and the run-rate, which is approximately &euro;1,750.  The NTPF fair deal scheme is under review.  St. Joseph's, the staff, residents and their families need to be given time in the context of that review.  Option one is the provision of a grant from the HSE or the Department of Health that bridges the gap until a new NTPF rate is agreed as part of a new NTPF strategy.  Option two, which St. Joseph's is open to, is that the HSE takes over the beds as section 39 beds.  The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated given that the board is meeting in eight days.  Are either of those two options viable and could movement be achieved in the next eight days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#K01400","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for raising this serious issue and for his active work in this area as well.  The Deputy is correct that dementia care is different from standard nursing home care.  I have visited St. Joseph's, as I am sure has Deputy Donnelly.  The level of care provided there is exceptional.  The needs of the residents are extremely complex.  We need more facilities like St. Joseph's, not less.  I believe St. Joseph's to be a model of excellence when it comes to the provision of care for people with dementia.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly rightly acknowledged that the element directly within the control of the HSE was swiftly resolved.  I thank the HSE for engaging and providing additional funding and certainty about the day-care centre.  I appreciate that an overwhelming 93% of St. Joseph's costs pertain to the residential service, which is funded through the NTPF.  The Deputy and I know that I am precluded by law from becoming involved in the negotiations.  I call on St. Joseph's, as I have repeatedly done, to exhaust the NTPF appeals process.  The NTPF has made known to the HSE and, I think, St. Joseph's, that its appeals process will be expedited.  St. Joseph's needs to exhaust that process.  If that brings a resolution, we will all be happy.  Deputy Donnelly's question, as I understand it, is what will be done to keep St. Joseph's open if that process is exhausted swiftly and does not deliver a resolution.  My message today is as clear as it was on day one - we will find a mechanism to keep it open.  I need everyone to follow the rules in terms of exhausting the NTPF process.  That is not to suggest that people are not doing so.  No doubt, there are many other nursing homes monitoring this case.<\/p> <p>  As I informed Deputy Donnelly last week in the D&aacute;il, I will use every legal instrument and lever available to me to keep this facility open.  That could mean lots of different things.  My priority is that the people living in St. Joseph's remain there and that the service continues to be provided.  I have made that commitment several times and I am working daily to fulfil it.  I will also work with the Deputy in this regard.  As he mentioned, the board will meet in eight days and so no time should be wasted.  Deputy Donnelly mentioned that St. Joseph's had written to me.

It might be more appropriate to correspond with me on that.  I have no difficulty with that.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is the departure of Dr. Kevin McCarthy from the children's chronic pain clinic at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Hospital.  This issue has been covered fairly extensively in the media but has also been raised directly with me by constituents.  Dr. McCarthy does an extremely important job.  He provides pain relief to children.  I do not know how he does it.  I am being told is that there has been no formal communication to date with parents.  When I say I am being told this, what I mean is that I am being told that by parents whose children are under the care of Dr. McCarthy.  I know that the consultant group at Children's Health Ireland has written to senior management.  It is asking a number of questions that I want to put here  The questions relate to an immediate clarification of how Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin plans to deliver a pain service once Dr. McCarthy has left.  There does not seem to be a plan.  When I say there has been no formal communication with parents, what I mean is that nobody has sat in a room and told parents how pain management for their children will be dealt with the consultant departs.  I am seeking an assurance that the reason for Dr. McCarthy's departure will be addressed, including the lack of funding.  He was very clear and explicit as to why he was leaving.  He cited the lack of funding and provision of support services required for the safe running of a multidisciplinary pain management team.  Obviously, reassurance is being sought that the families of affected patients will be informed formally.  Obviously, these families all know because it has been in the media but they have not received formal notification that the pain consultant will be departing and, more importantly, nobody has told them what the care pathway for their children will be.  These are children who suffer really severe pain and if they are under the care of Dr. McCarthy, as the Minister well knows, notwithstanding all the facts, they are children who have been on a waiting list because a person does not get to see a consultant overnight.  He or she must wait so these children have waited a long time and are now under the care of a consultant but that consultant is departing and there appears to be no care plan in place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#M00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising this issue.

HIQA conducted a review of the Rotunda Hospital which I will not read out in full because, quite frankly, it shames the people on the other side of this room.  The issues raised are very serious.  HIQA says that the cot spacing between babies is inadequate.  It also says that there is no additional or spare neonatal intensive care unit capacity in other units nationally and therefore the national neonatal intensive care system is in a precarious state as the Rotunda caps its admissions.  On the adult high dependency unit, it says that there is a lack of space around the bed to allow for full resuscitation to be instigated and the necessary equipment to be brought into the room.  I will not read all of this out for fear some pregnant woman is watching this and ends up terrified.  These are issues that have been raised with the Minister and the HSE on more than one occasion.  Why has Mr. Reid not met representatives of the Rotunda Hospital yet?  Is there a reluctance to meet them?  Why did the Minister not attend the meeting with the Rotunda Hospital that was scheduled recently?  I understand that officials from his Department attended.  A face-to-face meeting has been sought to raise issues that are of very serious concern.  The Rotunda serves my constituency.  My area is probably the biggest user of the hospital, notwithstanding the fact that the hospital is in the city centre.  As Mr. Reid will know, my constituency has the fastest growing population in the State.  These are services that are absolutely vital and demand is only growing.  I understand that demand is falling nationally but in the constituency that the Rotunda serves it is growing.  When will steps be taken to make the Rotunda Hospital a safer place for women, babies and staff?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#O00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I have met representatives of the Rotunda and have visited the hospital on numerous occasions.  I was in direct contact with the Rotunda as recently as the last couple of days.  I was not in a position to attend the meeting to which the Deputy refers.  To be clear, we need to do something to help the Rotunda - of that there is no doubt.  The plan is to move the Rotunda Hospital to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown but that will not happen today or tomorrow.  In the interim, things need to happen and I accept that.  I also accept that the Rotunda has put forward a plan.  I am the Minister for Health in the Department of Health and we work with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We need to see an agreed plan put in place between the hospital, the CEO of the hospital, who is also the master, and the HSE, which is then presented to Government.  That plan must then be assessed against the public spending code and so forth.  My understanding is that relatively recently the Rotunda and the HSE arrived at an agreed plan for interim works and my officials were briefed on that plan last week.  Now we need to look at moving that through the public spending code.<\/p> <p>  To be very clear, we need to take action on the Rotunda Hospital.  I am not saying that we are waiting for the Rotunda to move to Connolly, as I have read in some reports.  The fear of the people working in the Rotunda today is that nothing is going to happen until the big move but that is not the case.

I abhor the practice of using debt collection agencies to chase people because the people being chased are sick.  I wish to bring to the witnesses' attention one example of the practice.  An elderly lady who has a medical card needed a hip operation.  She could not wait for a public appointment so her family clubbed together, with money they did not really have, to ensure that she could get an operation privately.  Following on from that, she developed septicemia and was admitted to hospital.  However, because she had previously been a private patient, she was brought into the private wing of the hospital.  This elderly lady who had septicemia did not know where she was being brought.  She was brought to the private wing in the hospital.  She now has a bill for &euro;4,000 and is being chased by a debt collection agency.  This is one example and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#P00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have the name of the hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#P00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Yes, I have the name of the hospital but I do not want to name it because the woman is terrified of being identified-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#P00600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>She went into a public hospital and ended up on a private ward.

We spoke about similar scenarios when we were discussing women who went for private tests in the context of CervicalCheck and the Minister confirmed that even if a woman had a private test, she could go back into the public system.  This woman, through no fault of her own, was filtered back into the private system and now has an outstanding bill and is being pursued by debt collectors.  Nobody in the debt collection agency cares about the fact that the woman has a medical card, or about her means or her capacity to pay.  All those in the agency care about is recovering the debt.  I believe the use of debt collection agencies should cease because it has no place in the public health service.  No compassion is being shown to this woman.  When a case goes to a debt collection agency, it is taken out of the public system.  A debt collection agency is just a company that is interested in recovering a debt; it does not care how the debt was incurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#P00800","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The Minister will respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#P00900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>This might be an issue for my HSE colleagues.

However, my clear understanding is that if a patient is brought into a public hospital, he or she would have to opt to be a private patient.

I appreciate that Mr. Reid has agreed to visit UHL because several committee members would like to go the hospital with him in the coming days.  I am not interested in dramatics but in solutions.  I have written to Mr. Reid about UHL and the mid-west more generally.  Deputy Harty is also from the mid-west and knows that what is going on there at the moment is catastrophic.  I had to beg for a new CT scanner, which is due to be delivered on Friday, because it was so obviously needed.  I have made a comparison between the resources at UHL and at Beaumont Hospital and the disparity is frightening.  These are similar hospitals in similar areas.  While it is true that apples cannot be compared with apples or oranges with oranges in the context of hospitals, the differential in staff numbers, including doctors, nurses and administrative staff, is huge and makes no sense.  The reconfiguration of hospitals in the mid-west was done at the wrong time and without sufficient money.  We all know what happened and it is not the fault of anyone in this room but we are now left in a dreadful situation, where people, including members of my own family, are afraid to go into UHL.  I do not blame them.  The differential across support staff, administrative staff, nurses, medical staff and other health care professionals is huge.  I will not even bother going through the figures, which were provided by the HSE.  In terms of the number of beds we are looking at 432 versus 659.  I know that Professor Keane is currently preparing a report but I do not have any faith in that process because the amount of time spent there was very short.  I do not want a report to be published that is about process but not about resources because the two go hand in hand.  We cannot solve problems in the mid-west without dealing with the resource issue.  People are afraid to address the resource issue.<\/p><p>It is then perceived as blame.  I am gone beyond worrying about blame.  Of course there are process issues but the resource gaps here are ginormous compared to other hospitals.  I put forward a range of interim short-term solutions.  I have listed them multiple times on the record of the D&aacute;il and in the committee and they have all been ignored.  I am really worried about the narrative being put out and being influenced with regard to University Hospital Limerick from a HSE corporate point of view versus what is real on the ground with the staff and management in the hospital, whom I do not blame because they work as hard as they can.<\/p><p> A report has come out in the past 48 hours that has been done by two pretty eminent NHS doctors, Dr. Chris Moulton and Dr. Cliff Mann.  It shows their estimate that since 2016 of those who have been waiting in an NHS accident and emergency department for between six and 11 hours almost 5,500 have died.  If we extrapolate this data what does it mean for us here in Ireland?  I ask the Minister what we will we do.  I ask him not to list all the stuff about the MRI and a few extra beds because I have heard it all before.  They will not have the impact.  I live there.  It is chronically bad.  It is catastrophic.  People will die in the coming months.  What are we going to do?  I am begging the Minister.  We need solutions.  People living near me will potentially die because of this and this is despite the fact that everyone in the hospital is working so hard.

I will focus on one or two issues.  I have raised the issue of cataract operations in Cork over the past six or eight weeks.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware there is a huge problem regarding cataract operations being done in Cork.  Last year, the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital sent out over 600 cases to the NTPF.  I have made a submission to the Minister, which I understand has also gone to the HSE, that were an extra theatre put in place in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, ten or 12 cataract operations could be done a day, five days a week.  There are five consultants in that area in that hospital; they each have only one day per week in theatre.  As a result, they are dealing with very serious eye complaints and therefore, cataract operations are pushed to the back and are not being dealt with.  I am advised that were there a second theatre dealing with this, the problem would be resolved and that it would pay for itself within a year and a half to two years.  The cost is &euro;3 million.  Can I get a detailed reply to that submission?  Many people are travelling outside of Cork, some to Northern Ireland, and it is the direct result of the facility not being there to do the operation.  <\/p><p> The second question relates to the growth in the population of Cork.  Much work has been done around new hospitals in Dublin and we are talking about three elective hospitals around the country.  They are vital for the areas for which they are designated.  What progress has been made in respect of Cork or when we can progress the process?  Even if we identified a site this morning, it would take at least two years to go through the design and planning process and being realistic, it would be three years before reaching the stage of putting in foundations.  It needs to be prioritised in Cork.  A huge amount of work is going out of Cork at present because it lacks the capacity to deal with all the work that is there.  There is a population of more than 550,000, which will grow dramatically in the next three to four years, when one considers the development of new offices and all the companies expanding in Cork.  There will be an automatic growth in population, as well as catering for the work out of Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, and Kerry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#T03000","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising these matters.  On his proposal to use the South Infirmary for cataract operations, as an example I refer to the investment we made through the NTPF working with the HSE in Nenagh hospital, where the hospital group came forward with a proposal to say that it had underutilised theatres and with an investment of about &euro;1 million, from memory, that it could open a centre of excellence for cataract procedures.  That has dramatically reduced waiting times and waiting lists for cataract procedures.  My opening statement noted the significant fall we had seen in the waiting times for ophthalmology.  The Senator has sent his proposal to myself and the HSE.  I suggest that the HSE and NTPF, working together, could consider that in the context of 2020.  I do not know enough about the individual projects but to be clear, we are very eager, and it is Government policy, to use the NTPF resource, which is now up at &euro;100 million, to increase capacity in the public health service, where possible, rather than using the private health service.  It is necessary to use the private health service from time to time but where possible, the public health service should be used.  We certainly will look at it through that prism.  I will also ask Dr. Henry to comment.<\/p> <p>  On the population of Cork, which the Senator consistently and robustly raises, he is correct about the population of Cork having grown so much and that the bed stock and health service needs to grow to fit the population.  I have received initial proposals and feedback from the South-South West hospital group on its views on an elective hospital for Cork.  Under the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office, we established an expert group to look at what an elective hospital is, without being smart about it.  Different countries do different things, so it is asking what is provided in an elective hospital and what is not provided.<\/p><p>There are different models around the world.  We expect to be in a position at the start of 2020, which is only weeks away, although it sounds ages away, to move forward on site selection.  Dr. Henry might wish to add to my points on both issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#U00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>First, in regard to eyes, it is not just a question of additional theatre capacity because it is a matter of how we use existing theatres.  Treatment for macular degeneration sometimes constitutes an inappropriate use of a theatre.  A treatment room could equally effectively and safely provide the same treatment.  The consultant ophthalmologist community in Cork has raised this.  There have been successful endeavours in Nenagh and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital whereby we commissioned additional work in theatres through the NTPF, addressing something that lends itself readily to such initiatives, namely, day-case cataract work.<\/p> <p>  With regard to scheduled care, as the Minister said, the most important point is to get the design right and consider the scope of what a scheduled care hospital would look like.  Let me give two examples.  In the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Scotland, there is a large scheduled care hospital that runs a range of services, right up to services that require intensive care, overnight stays and quite intensive, complicated surgery.  Another example is Omagh hospital in the North.  It is a scheduled care hospital that does not have inpatient beds at all.  There are day hospital beds.  The design is crucial because it has to address waiting list needs as they stand and as they are projected, and our population needs.  There has to be a model of care that is sustainable, particularly in view of the recruitment and manpower required.  The work the Minister said is ongoing will come to a conclusion soon.  Once the scope of scheduled care centres is decided, it will inform the design, location and so on the schedule care hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>There are five cataract consultants.

It is a detailed proposal from the clinical director in South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  I ask that it be considered seriously.<\/p> <p>  On the second issue concerning the hospital in Cork, growth in Dublin is continuing but growth in Cork will escalate at a fast pace over the next ten years.  We need to deal with this hospital issue immediately.  There are now 130,000 additional people living in Cork without one extra hospital bed open in the period.  That is a lot of people.

The number of consultants has increased from approximately 2,100 to more than 3,100 since 2009.  Can we get current figures?  Various figures are being bandied about and we have do not have accurate figures.  How many consultants are in permanent pensionable posts, how many are locums and how many are working in an agency capacity?  Can we have a breakdown of those numbers?  It is important to know the numbers.  There is a great deal of information in circulation and it is very hard to understand who has the real figures.  I am looking for clarification.  I fully accept that more posts have been created but we have not got clarification on the number<i>in situ <\/i>who are permanent and pensionable.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise regarding consultants, which I have raised previously, is the lack of planning for consultant retirement.<\/p><p>With regard to colposcopy and obstetrics and gynaecology, there is quite a large number to retire over the next three to four years.  What amount of planning is occurring?  I am sure the retirements are happening in other areas also.  Planning does not appear to be occurring.  Posts seem to be advertised once a person is retired and, therefore, locums have to be brought in to fill the post.<\/p><p> I received telephone calls from three different hospitals about people who are advised to meet Mr. Reid but who do not raise any concerns about any issues in their hospital because they want to give a good impression of what is happening there.  Staff are actually being advised not to raise concerns.  Is the feedback staff have about very genuine concerns not being fed back directly to Dr. Henry?  I have heard staff from three different hospitals raise this issue.  The only ones who seem to be raising genuine concerns are staff who are about to retire and who feel they are not going to lose out by doing so.  There has to be a different approach to ensuring the HSE is getting a true account of the difficulties staff are facing in particular hospitals.  The matter needs to be approached in a different way.  I have heard reports on this matter from three hospitals in different parts of the country.  I am raising this because I believe it is true and accurate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#V00500","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I will take the second point first and then address consultant numbers and the recruitment process.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, I do not know what the Senator's examples are so I cannot comment specifically on them.  I can say the following, however: in the six months I have been here, I have been around most of the settings, everywhere from Letterkenny and the west and south-east coasts to the Dublin locations and the midlands.  I have been to hospital, acute, community, social care and section 38 settings.  In those visits, I do not spend my time just with management.  I have a brief 35-minute meeting with management and I spend at least four hours walking around talking to staff.  I generally spend my lunch with a group of staff who decide they want to sit beside me.  I get regular and frequent feedback on the issues from staff.  This has been very valuable for me.  It is the way I operate.  It is a management style I have and it has informed me greatly about some of the challenges we face in tackling some of the pressures in the health system.  I have been very open with staff and I have been very engaged.  From the feedback I have got, I believe staff feel there is now a chance to raise the real issues they are experiencing.  I have spent a significant amount of my time on staff engagement.  I spend at least a day and a half per fortnight out in the settings.  That is how I operate.  The feedback indicates very informally the real issues that arise in the various settings, not just the acute settings but also the community settings.  The Minister was touching on process earlier but the feedback is informing me about a number of issues, the first being how those at the HSE centre really need to consider what they are doing and make sure it is adding value for staff at the front line in services and social care.  As I said my opening statement, that is a process I have commenced already.  We are going to examine what we do in the centre and ask whether it adds value for front-line staff.  If not, we will stop it.  I have very firmly flipped my focus onto our front-line service delivery teams to determine the issues that arise for them and how we need to address them.<\/p> <p>  In our staff satisfaction survey, which was published just last December, there were some very real issues arising over control culture.  People were feeling very motivated in their own jobs but not connected to middle and senior management.  They did not feel they were able to raise issues.  That is something I am very conscious of and that I want to change.  That is why I am spending my time in the acute setting.  I reassure the Senator that I am very happy to tackle or examine any specific issues the Senator has.  My personal style is a leadership style.  I have been in the private sector, the not-for-profit sector, central government, local government and now the HSE.  I can only demonstrate by what I do.  I have outlined what I do.<\/p> <p>  The second issue, that of consultant posts, is a very genuine one.  We are all aware it is not just an Irish issue but that it is also a global one.<\/p><p>We are making progress, but it is slow.  We want to recruit more consultants.  We have more capacity to recruit more consultants and more funding in our plan next year to do so.  We are seeing the beginning of a more positive trend this year.  As I mentioned, year on year we have 142 extra consultants and 135 since January.  The net figure, because we are losing some, is an increase of 90 consultants this year, which is the start of a trend.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Reilly mentioned the time lag.  It is too long.  We are running some pilot projects on doing that more locally and that is probably a better way to progress quickly, but we will work with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in that regard.  We have some numbers by speciality across the country, that is, the number of consultants we have by country, by speciality and by hospital.  We will be happy to provide those to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Can we get details of the number of locums and agency consultants as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#X00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Yes.

First, we must acknowledge the success of using the National Treatment Purchase Fund to cut waiting lists for various procedures, as there has been a considerable drop in the number of people on them.  For example, in the case of inpatient or day case procedures the number fell by 20,000 up to November 2019.  That is a major achievement.  There are still two tranches of 20,000 each to go to bring the figure down to zero, which should be our aim.  Do we have the commitment and procedures in place to continue on that line and to reduce the waiting lists to the necessary and desirable extent?  It is no use to say it is at a tolerable level now.  We must continue with it down to the wire, as it were.<\/p> <p>  My second question arises from Deputy O'Reilly's comments on the replacement of consultants.  If a consultant is due to retire, presumably notice is given by the consultant in advance.  Why not adopt a procedure whereby whatever reappointment procedures are required are put in place instantly?  I realise there is an argument that sometimes they are not approved or they could be on a list waiting for approval, but why not appoint them temporarily?  We must get away from the nonsense of this weighted procedure that is so laborious.  There are procurement procedures that must be complied with, but there should be no gaps in the provision of service.  It must be a seamless provision.  There can be no gaps in the entitlement of the public to have a continuous health service.  That should be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that we occasionally come across glitches, as occurred in our local hospital.  I am loath to be parochial but everybody else does it.  Even you, Chairman, have been known to do it from time to time.  There is a rise in political testosterone, on both sides, during the approach to general elections and one must make allowances for that, but that should not distract us from the issue of making a simple intervention that can be very cost effective.  The Minister has seen the issues in our hospital.  Some of them are ongoing and some are periodic.  I am aware that provision is being made at present, but I wish to raise two matters.  First, we need to know whether there are vacant spaces in our hospitals, particularly where patients are in corridors and awaiting treatment and where ambulances are waiting outside the hospital to deliver their patients and cannot do so for obvious reasons.  We must carry out an audit of the spaces that are available or that can be converted as a matter of urgency.  It is not rocket science.  It is very simple.<\/p><p> We must also examine the cost.  In most cases the question to ask is: \"Why are all the waiting spaces, the emergency department and the corridors full?\"  We must find out what is causing the problem.  Is it because there are no doctors or an insufficient number of doctors available?  Is it because an insufficient number of beds are available or insufficient space where beds or trolleys can be put?  Incidentally, there is no reason that a trolley cannot be put in a ward while awaiting transition instead of having patients in the front row at the entrance to the hospital, which is bad for hospital morale and bad and dangerous for patients.  It is bad for the morale of the staff and that is dangerous because there will eventually be stress, which causes other problems, and health and safety issues.  Could an urgent audit be carried out to ascertain the amount of spaces that can be supervised and in which beds or trolleys can be placed, rather than having them in corridors where patients, visitors and staff have to bump into each other?  I have seen cases where blood samples are being taken, people are being fed, patients are being visited, people are getting seriously ill and so forth in those circumstances.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this should be happening.  There is no reason for it to happen if there is covered space in the grounds.  If not, it is quite simple to get temporary accommodation that would meet that requirement.  It is not expensive.  We must look at the things we can do quickly to make it safer, better and more comfortable for patients.<\/p><p> On the issue of child mental health, we have all encountered situations where there are acute cases of autism and behavioural problems.  The patients are in obvious difficulty and their parents are at their wits' end trying to find something that meets their requirements.  I believe it is possible to provide an adequate service.  It is necessary to do so.  One of the things that is urgently required is a number of mental health programmes in-house where the child can be put on a programme that is corrective and has the required amount of supervision over a specified period of time, which is readily recognised.  Could that be done as a matter of urgency?  The mental health sector has always been regarded as the Cinderella, but at some stage we need to recognise that there is a growing problem in that area.  There is no necessity for it.  Two parents called to see me last weekend.  They are desperate to find a way to solve the problem for their child.

One of the challenges is to scale up those initiatives and have a level of consistency across all emergency departments.<\/p> <p>  To reassure the Deputy I will give a few examples of what is happening across the acute settings.  There is a very good innovative process with streaming.  Patients who come from GP referrals with adequate information can be referred through the ED and onwards.  That is happening very well in a number of areas.<\/p><p>Somebody mentioned ANPs, advanced nursing practitioners earlier.  The use of ANPs in our emergency departments, EDs, and indeed clinicians and advanced medical assessment units are very successfully moving on patients with specific needs much more quickly.  Triage processes, which can differ in many EDs, have been very successful.  Emergency clinicians in EDs prove very beneficial and help patient flows so that we do not have the congestion that has been seen.  Much of our patient advocacy services specifically in terms of some mental health issues that the Deputy just spoke about on our EDs are working very well for us.<\/p><p> A number of initiatives are taking place.  Our challenge is definitely to use space, on which I am sure we have a very accurate picture across the way, but more importantly to scale up some of those good initiatives which are happening around the place.

The issues that arise in EDs are often symptomatic of challenges across the entire site.  It is important for us to look at the totality of the beds.  They go into a hospital on a given day and audit everybody in a bed to see who is in the bed and whether they should be there or if they should be somewhere else.  That work goes on all the time.  They have been focusing on our most challenged sites recently to ensure the best use is made of all the available beds.  I assure members of the committee that that improvement work is constantly ongoing.<\/p> <p>  I might say a word about mental health and children.  We currently have 71 community teams and we have beds.  Interestingly, we hear much about people awaiting mental health beds.  At any one time at the moment we might only have one or two people on a waiting list for an acute mental health bed.  Our challenge relates more to the different needs of different groups of children.  Deputy Durkan mentioned autism.  Where we have children with different types of needs, they are not necessarily appropriate for acute mental health beds.  We are developing an approach focused on in-home intensive support and in-home intensive respite.  That will come with a range of behavioural supports so that children can stay at home and be fully supported with behavioural and other supports.  That will be growing again in 2020.  We are trying to differentiate between children who have different needs and to ensure we are providing the right supports in the right place for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Earlier I said 83 beds of the 190 have been approved.  Running a live tracker here, I now believe it is 107 beds because 25 for Tallaght have now also been approved.  Therefore 107 of the additional 190 we hope to open have now been approved.  If we stay for the day we might get that figure up even further.  It is 107 and we can keep the committee updated as the numbers come in.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Durkan for his initiatives.  We had a very good visit to Naas General Hospital last Thursday night.  We saw a very hard-working management team and staff in a very busy environment.  Thankfully that hospital has had a slight decrease in trolley numbers this year, on which the staff are to be commended.  There has been a decrease in attendances at the ED this year, but a significant increase in attendances of people over the age of 75.  When we were in that ED last week I was struck by the age profile.  Further to Ms O'Connor's point, it raises the broader discussion about the profile of the people ending up in EDs and whether more can be done the help them not end up in them, through doing more in our nursing homes, through more of the statutory home care scheme and through enhanced primary care teams.  That is the message I took away from our visit to Naas General Hospital last week.<\/p> <p>  The endoscopy unit needs to go to tender in early 2020, which is the intention.  That will greatly increase the capacity for scopes.  The very dedicated clinicians there have long been promised this.  They were about to get it and then the economy crashed.  That is badly needed.  I was excited to hear that that would give rise to the possibility of building two extra wards which would also provide more capacity.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked how we can get that waiting list to zero.  He very kindly and fairly noted the progress we have made in reducing the number of people waiting for hospital operations.  If we are very honest, we must acknowledge the number will never be zero, as the Deputy knows, because people will always be joining the list.  It is much more important to focus on how long they are waiting.  Many people, who go to see a doctor today and are referred for an operation, would not necessarily want the operation immediately.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare committee proposed that people should not wait longer than 12 weeks.  When I became Minister, about 32% of people in 2017 were having their hospital operation in 12 weeks or less and that is now up to 42%.  The right question for us all to ask is how we can get that 42% up to 100%.<\/p><p>We have discussed at length some of the ways we can do that.<\/p><p> Ms O'Connor may wish to add to what was said about CAMHS.  Thankfully through the investment we have made in the new assistant psychology posts and the 20 psychology posts in primary care, we have 114 assistant psychologists now working in primary care - certainly funded posts - and we have 20 psychology posts in primary care since last year.  We have seen a 20% reduction in the number of people waiting for child and adolescent mental health services.  If it is the Deputy's child or mine, we need them in straightaway.  Those lists are reducing and we need to build on that further.<\/p><p> One of the reasons for that reduction is that we are widening the range of services we are providing.  Not everybody needs to go through the CAMHS.  For some people an assistant psychologist might work.  On the other end of the spectrum, we will open the Portrane hospital next year.  We need to look at the entire range of mental health services available and not channel everybody through one route.  We need to broaden the capacity through a variety of ways. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Z00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>We are also working closely with schools to try to support children in the environments they should be in.

In the past couple of weeks one of the four got on to a programme which was necessary.  In one case the child severely injured themselves and was referred to an accident and emergency department.  They had to wait all day in the accident and emergency department from 8 a.m. until night and had to come in the following morning again.  This is where we need to marry up the services.  It should have been possible for somebody somehow somewhere to identify the child as an urgent case.  The child, who had suffered a really serious injury, should have been taken out of the queue and put somewhere else to be dealt with.

Methadone has been in our communities for many years, providing help for people with addiction problems to live their lives.  Many people have been on methadone for some time and want to stay on it.  Sometimes it is sometimes difficult to change people's attitude to moving from one service to another.  Methadone helps them to achieve their daily tasks.  Another drug, Suboxone, can be used instead of methadone but it is not for everybody because people with other medical issues cannot take it.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question on what are we doing about the drug services in our communities, we have the national strategy of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  We work on the ground with the HSE, statutory agencies and other bodies to bring people with addiction problems through recovery and support and, above all, deal with their families.  The stigma of addiction is still alive and well in our communities and we are trying to tackle that and create a health-led approach to the national drugs strategy.  It is about reducing the harm and helping people who have been on methadone for a long time to have a different focus in their lives.<\/p> <p>  Methadone will continue to be very much a part of the service that is provided for people who are in addiction but services will also be provided by level 1 and level 2 GPs.  Considerable work is being done with people in programmes on a daily basis, trying to facilitate them to go forward and live normal lives.  I meet and speak with many people who are on methadone and it is like a long-term illness for them because they need a certain amount of methadone to continue to function.  Level 1 and level 2 GPs and pharmacists are doing their best to help people with their doses and the prescription of methadone will continue for some time.  It is not the be-all and end-all of drug treatment but it is a means by which people can be looked after on maintenance programmes.  That is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  That is why it is so important that the national drugs strategy is seen as a health-led document, rather than a criminal justice document, and people who have specific illnesses relating to their addiction to alcohol and drugs are guided through the services in their communities.  The HSE and some of the primary care service centres across the country provide methadone clinics and needle exchange clinics.  People are visiting these centres on a daily basis.  They are not separated, they go in the same door as other patients and participate in the healthcare system.  One of the biggest problems is the stigma relating to addiction and to the families of addicts.  People who are trapped in addiction experience that stigma every day, particularly when they are living in communities where their families can also be targeted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#BB00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":208,"content":"<p>I will come back in again shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#BB00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#BB00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I will comment on CAMHS.

That set out a range of actions in respect of CAMHS initiatives that were to be put in place and those actions still hold true.  Many of them have been done but more need to be invested in.  One of those actions that was launched recently was a helpline to support young adults at points of distress in their lives.

Both the Minister and the Deputy have spoken about what they have seen in emergency departments.  My experience of visiting nearly all the 24-7 emergency departments around the country is that a significant cohort of patients should be treated in a different way and in a different setting.  A significant proportion of people who attend emergency departments are members of our aged population.  These people have chronic illnesses and multiple illnesses.  This is not a criticism because people are not attending emergency departments when they should not be.  We must create new routes for their treatment.  We need more GPs.  I have met people from the training college to discuss the matter and it is positive that is looks as if more GPs are coming on stream.  We need to invest in that and that is a part of our Sl&aacute;intecare solution.  Pharmacies can play a much better role in the context of treatment and care in the future.  The contract for pharmacists will be negotiated next year and that will give us an opportunity to look at what levels of care can take place in a pharmacy setting.  The first thing we need to do is to reduce the entry points into acute settings.<\/p> <p>  I listed a number of good, innovative triage processes, including advanced medical assessment units, having emergency department consultants in the emergency department all the time and having GPs in the emergency department.  There is really good innovation and the challenge is to scale that up across the country.  It is an issue of capacity in hospitals and the Minister has outlined some relief that will be part of the solution.  We also need more egress points, as the Minister touched on, which means more community and step-down beds and more investment in nursing home support schemes, which we will have in 2020 when we launch the service plan.<\/p> <p>  We would be misleading the public if we were to say that we will make matters better in a few weeks or months by doing this or that.   We have a key performance indicator in respect of trolleys.  I have worked in capacity and workflow management all my career and we have what is called a lag indicator which looks at the measure at the end of a congestion point.  We must develop a way of looking at our setting that looks at the whole workflow management process.  That is about entry points and how to reduce pressure on them at capacity, how in-house flow can be improved and the need for more settings for patients who are egressing.  This will not be solved in weeks or months and I did not convince anybody that it would be solved in that timescale when I took this job.  This is a relentless process in which we must invest for the coming years through Sl&aacute;intecare.  We must stick to the plan.  That is the longer-term solution and that is when we will be doing justice to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I do not agree entirely, but I will come back in again later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Would the Minister like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I will comment briefly on the issue of drug addiction.

I genuinely believe that before we go into the general election every party in the House should try to agree on a cross-party basis, as we have done on other contentious issues, that, whoever wins the election, we have a direction of travel.  We should agree that between year X and year Y we are going to travel the journey to free contraception.  It requires legislation.  We can give out free condoms.  We are already doing that.  We have expanded the national condom distribution service this year and vending machines are going in across colleges.  There is a legislative requirement for contraception when going to the doctor and the pharmacy.  We should legislate for the availability of free contraception on a phased basis by the end of 2020 or the start of 2021, but we need to agree the roadmap to get to full coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#DD00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>Paediatricians made a statement this morning about the unsuitability of direct provision and the impact on children's lives.

Let us consider what direct provision and emergency accommodation for people coming to our country are about.  This is about people coming from what can be a highly traumatic environment and fleeing oppression to another country.  We can all imagine the trauma of that.  We can only begin to imagine the trauma of that for a child.  It is fair to say all of us are grappling with finding the right solutions from a housing and accommodation point of view.  I note Mr. Justice McMahon's documents proposing significant reform to direct provision.<\/p><p>We are committed to making those improvements.  We have to take, and we are taking, a whole-of-government approach to this.  The job of dealing with immigration, refugees and direct provision does not fall solely to the Department of Justice and Equality.  We had a Cabinet committee meeting on this earlier this week.  My Department is putting in health supports as well.  That is important.<\/p><p> We have a major issue that we have to nip in the bud.  It relates to the creeping racism in our political debates around this.  I am not going to get into specific examples but I believe we all need to call it out.  Whoever is in government will face this challenge.  The Department of Justice and Equality is doing an excellent job on behalf of Irish citizens in responding to Ireland's international obligations to take in, support and give c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to people fleeing oppression.  That means all our communities providing support.  It means all of us providing enough resources and supports for those communities.  My Department will not be found wanting in that regard.<\/p><p> Is direct provision the ideal model?  Absolutely not, but the Deputy and I need to be able to answer the question of what the ideal model is.  In the midst of a housing shortage we need to be realistic.  We need to make our direct provision far better.  We need to implement the recommendations of the McMahon report and that is what we are doing.  My Department and the HSE need put in place the wraparound services and that is what we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#DD00800","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I have spoken to the Minister previously about the GP contract.

The Chairman raised the matter with me in the D&aacute;il last week.  The first part is to acknowledge that we need to train far more GPs.

We are now training more GPs than ever and that is good news.<\/p> <p>  The second part is how the hell we ensure they stay GPs and how we keep them in Ireland.  The GP contract is an important part of that.  A doctor can now become a GP in an era that will be post FEMPI, one in which doctors will be better resourced and supported not only financially but in terms of paternity leave, maternity leave, increased rural allowance and a fund for areas of urban deprivation if a doctor is working there.<\/p> <p>  The third point is the immediate issue.  What I have just said is good and important but the third point is the immediate issue.  There are areas today that need a GP tomorrow.  I commend what the HSE is doing in this regard, which is trying to be flexible in terms of how we can do practical things to incentivise a GP to stay in an area.  This may include things like trying to find premises for the GP, integrating the practice into a primary care centre or trying to assist with ancillary staffing.  This are things that make it a little more likely that a GP will agree to go into a given area.  I know the HSE are working on several areas throughout the country.  I think there is locum cover or GP cover in all of them.  Certainly, that is what I understood from my last briefing note, but people want a permanent GP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#EE00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>That is a sticking plaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#EE00400","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>People have an intimate relationship with the GP, and it is an important one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#EE00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Next is my usual question seeking an update on Bantry General Hospital, the endoscopy unit and the rehabilitation unit.

Having the retired GP who has just vacated the position as part of that panel is important because he or she may well have been head-hunting for somebody to come onto that list before he or she retires and would have a good deal of local knowledge about who would be the most appropriate person to take on the list.  It is often the case that a list is drawn up, the system of offering it to the first, second or third person is gone through and by the time the person who wants the job or could take it is reached, he or she has moved on.  The marking system is disconnected from the practical availability of GPs on the ground because the longer a panel is unfilled, the less chance we have of getting somebody from that existing panel.  The input of the retiring GP or much more local input in the interview process would speed up the filling of that position.<\/p><p> The MRI scanner in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is long overdue but very welcome.  I am disappointed that it will operate only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  The MRI scanner is essential to reducing the number of people waiting for admission to the hospital and confining its use from Monday to Friday does not make the best use of it.  It should operate for longer hours during the week but it also should function at weekends to clear the backlog of MRI scans, not only for patients in casualty but also patients on waiting lists.  Consultants in the mid-west are now advising public patients to get their scans done privately because they will not get them done publicly in a timely manner.  It is important that the Minister should consider the opening hours for that scanner.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid referred earlier to theatres in Ennis hospital.  It is essential that the theatres in the hospital be upgraded.  Two new modular theatres are required to allow inpatient day-care procedures to be carried out.  That would take a lot of pressure off UL and allow ear, nose and throat surgery in particular, about which we have spoken previously, to be developed in Ennis hospital in the way ophthalmology services have been developed in Nenagh.  It would be critical infrastructure to put in place to solve the problems all of us have mentioned earlier in respect of UHL.  The Minister might comment on using our model 2 hospitals to the maximum advantage.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid also mentioned hospital avoidance.  It is critical that we expand our community intervention team, CIT, services to allow frail elderly people remain in their homes.  CIT services are essential for that.  There is an axis between CIT GPs and public health nurses.<\/p><p>If they do not exist within the community, people will end up in accident and emergency services unnecessarily when they could be managed at home.<\/p><p> We mentioned previously that it is essential to expand community diagnostics.  That is one of the pillars of the winter plan for the mid-west but I am not aware how GPs or others access those community diagnostics because information is not available on that.<\/p><p> On the timeline for scheduled care hospitals, site selection will happen next year.  In terms of the process, it will then have to go to design, procurement, tendering, building and commissioning.  What is the timeline for an elective hospital to take in patients?  Is the children's hospital consuming funds that should be going to all of those other services?  The Minister might give us a timeline for that in respect of elective hospitals.<\/p><p> My last question relates to ophthalmology services in the mid-west.  The waiting time from seeing the consultant to having surgery is reduced but the waiting time for an initial visit, even though one may have a diagnosis of a cataract from an optician, needs to be removed.  One presents with the diagnosis.  A diagnosis process is not necessary but getting to that first visit is still taking two to three years in the mid-west.  I accept the time may be shorter after one has been seen but the time between being referred and being seen is still two to three years.  That is my first tranche of questions for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#KK01000","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

We need to listen to him on that in terms of his professional experience but also his knowledge in terms of what is happening on the ground in rural parts of Ireland.  We may or may not agree on this but I am clear as to what we need to do about increasing the pipeline in terms of new GPs and trying to keep them in Ireland.  I accept that we need to do more in terms of the contract but as I said earlier, there is an immediacy now in some communities.  We are already seeing on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis communities stepping up after the crisis emerges, meeting with the HSE and asking how this can be fixed.  We are seeing good examples of some of the collaboration taking place.  I saw it in Kerry recently where the community and the HSE locally are working together but only after the vacancy arises.  One of the points the Chairman is making is that there should be greater community involvement at a much earlier stage.  We know that, say, Dr. X is due to retire so we should start that process earlier.<\/p><p>The Chairman's comment on the marking scheme is fair.  There might be an issue in terms of a GP choosing their successor, which is not what he is suggesting, but we need to get the balance right.

The MRI scanner in University Hospital Limerick is opening 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to begin with.  However, the contract with the provider has the capacity to extend that.  If the demand requires longer hours, we can certainly introduce those.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman on the expansion of CIT services.  We are looking at CIT services.  We will be looking at increasing the CIT capacity and the community frailty intervention team in the community in the mid-west.  We want to focus our efforts on making sure that we have CITs, that they are integrated into the broader primary care service delivery and linked with acute hospitals also.

I have never suggested that these are things that can be done today or tomorrow.  They are very much a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a ten-year plan.  I hope that they will be delivered during the first half of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We would have a much better outlook regarding what they will constitute - sites and the like - by the first quarter of next year.<\/p><p> The Chairman's point about inpatient day cases versus outpatients is valid.  It is one we have discussed quite regularly and one that the NTPF, the HSE and the Department are eager to move on in 2020.  Patients do not differentiate between the outpatient and the inpatient nor should they.  If I have a problem with my eye, I need to see a consultant.  When I see the consultant, I might need a cataract operation or whatever.  That is the wait, that is the total time.  The question is whether we can put in place a system that takes someone through the entire process and whether the NTPF can help fund that whole journey, in other words, taking somebody through the outpatient clinic, to having the procedure done and out the other end?  The way we differentiate between outpatients and inpatients is not the way real life works for people.<\/p><p> There are very exciting proposals, with which the Chairman will be familiar, regarding community ophthalmology and a view that a lot more can be done in that context.  In the context of that specialty and half a dozen others to which I referred in my opening statement, we can press \"go\" on a few in 2020.

Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and the Chairman also raised this issue with the Minister of State, who indicated that he is focusing on it.  I wish to highlight the case of families where a child or adult with particular needs relating to Down's syndrome or another condition has been under the care of their parents and the parents have become old and inform or have passed away.  I feel particularly strongly about this because when the parents pass away, the vulnerable individual really has nobody to stand up for him or her apart from Members of this House or other public representatives.  There is a particular case in Mayo involving a young man in his early 30s.  Both his parents are deceased.  My understanding is that Western Care gets a budget allocation and is to provide services in the community.  In this case, it is not delivering the service because the individual is not getting residential care and no budget is available for him.  The net impact is that this young man does not have a stable environment.  People like him want to be under the care of Western Care and live out the rest of their lives in a stable environment.  While I know this is a priority for the Minister of State, can he give me any indication as to when a space for this gentleman, about whom I have been tormenting the Minister of State since last June, will become available?

As I said earlier, there will be a significant increase in resources over the &euro;2 billion figure regarding the HSE service plan.  I want to personalise this in one way because I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the important thing is to focus on the families and the person with a disability.  In 2020, we plan to have 8,358 residential places.  We have 33,700 day respite sessions, 166,00 respite overnights and 23,000 day places so these are the kind of plans that are in place.  One goes back to the core question.  Every year, we have a number of people in those situations.  I am pushing very strongly for the extra money and resources.  I have been talking to the Minister - even over the past few days.  The Minister gets it.  He is very supportive of me.  Do we need more residential places for people in critical need who have no family?  That is the phrase I am using.  The answer is \"Yes\".  I hope to see some of those new residential places come into play in the next couple of weeks.  That is my view at the moment but I do accept that when we are having a debate about budgets and the service plan, when one digs deep, one must pick out priorities.  I accept the Deputy's point about those adults with disabilities whose parents are dead.  Under the UN convention, these people have a right to a service so we must push that.  I am confident that there will be major improvements in the service plan for 2020.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#NN01300","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":294,"content":"<p>It was reported that about 10% of GPs have taken up the termination of pregnancy service.

The example I have been given is a girl in west Dublin with a full medical card who had to travel to another part of Dublin to get a GP to carry out her termination of pregnancy.  There is an anomaly within the PCRS.  Any GP providing the service can claim the fees for the termination of pregnancy but that same GP, who is not the person's regular GP, cannot prescribe Implanon or another long-acting reversible form of contraception.  It seems like a missed opportunity when the individual looking for the termination of pregnancy is eligible under the medical card system.  This is not about getting extra eligibility.  It is about someone who is already deemed eligible for medical card services being able to avail of services such as the insertion of Implanon by the GP who carries out the termination of pregnancy in the short period of time - either on the day or a short period of time thereafter.

Regarding methadone, I am delighted to hear that the Minister met with the families of people involving in the methadone scheme or who have had their lives ravaged by addiction.  I am very supportive of the Minister visiting the families.  For many people, particularly in these Houses, it is fine to talk about people in the abstract, be they in a methadone or direct provision centre or any sort of centre, as if they are a different type or sort of person but, as I am sure the Minister saw last night, these are normal people from normal families who walk among us and have just been hit in some unfortunate way and touched by the ravages of drug addiction.  I very much welcome the Minister's visit last night.  Methadone treatment is almost regarded as being negative.  There is a perception that if somebody is on 10 ml of methadone for the rest of his or her life, that is somehow a bad thing.<\/p><p>To my mind, it is a good thing.  If they need a maintenance dose to keep the show on the road and keep their lives in line, it is good to have that relationship with their prescribing doctor and their pharmacist to keep them on the straight and narrow.  I very much welcome this and any additional supports that can be given to families.  I welcome any measures that highlight what they have to deal with in their lives, the impacts on other children in the family and the extended family, and also people's positions in their neighbourhoods and communities.  Stigma has been mentioned this morning.  Families who have been ravaged by drugs often face strong push-back in their communities.  I welcome any moves to support those families.<\/p><p> As was reported yesterday, in recent times there has been a significant increase in the incidence of mumps in our population.  In Samoa, we have also seen a shutdown with the outbreak of measles.  All of this is part of the global dumbing down when it comes to vaccination, fake news, the Wakefield generation coming of age and such.  The net impact of the mumps outbreak is that we are going to have a generation of young men who will have fertility problems when they seek to start families.  Is there any plan to try to highlight this?  I have always thought that the young people who are affected are probably the key.  If a young man discovers that his parents chose not to vaccinate him against mumps when he was a child, and now his future in terms of having children is going to be severely impacted, is there any plan to wake that generation up to the impacts of previous decisions on their healthcare?  In terms of measles, the Minister said some time ago that he was exploring mandatory vaccinations and was seeking the position of the Attorney General.  While I do not agree with mandatory vaccination in a normal setting, it is now high time we addressed this.  We have the situation in Samoa.  The UK has lost its measles-free status, as far as I know.  This issue is encroaching on us and perhaps we should be prepared, if there is a confluence of events that leads to an outbreak here, to protect the population if we had to.  I would be grateful if the Minister could give us his thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#OO00400","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her comments.  After my meeting last night, I am just so conscious of how grateful families impacted by addiction are that she and others raise these issues and that we talk about them here.  They feel they are never talked about.  We do not talk about addiction enough in Ireland but we talk even less about the impact of addiction on the family.  The Deputy is right that the reason we do not do so is that there is a nice, cosy consensus and an ignorant view that this only happens to X type of person or in Y type of place.  That is complete and utter bull.  The phrase I kept thinking of last night is \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"  This could visit any of our homes or communities.  Frankly, it is visiting all of our communities.  A woman told me last night how the first time someone she knew became aware that her son was addicted to drugs was when she was sitting down watching Coronation Street.  There was a knock on the door and she asked her husband to get up and open it and there were two men in balaclavas with baseball bats standing at their hall door looking to recover a drugs debt.  This is a reality for people and we have to start talking about it.  It is a real health crisis, a public health epidemic.  There is a lot of that same ignorant stigma that we have around other social issues and the notion that it only happens to certain types of people.  That is nonsense and we need to call time on it.  In this committee or in a future configuration, we should be doing more on this.  I intend to do a lot more on it.  The UK has a helpline for families affected by addiction.  I want to explore how we can look at this as well.  We need to do a lot more.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of mumps, measles and mandatory vaccination, I know Deputy O'Connell is passionate about the whole area of vaccination.  The current status in terms of my own thought process and policy development is that I am awaiting a report from the Health Research Board, HRB.  I asked it to do a body of work on what could be effective.  I am not interested in a stunt or something that looks like we are doing something.  I want to do something.  I have asked the HRB to look at what other jurisdictions have done that has proven effective in terms of combating vaccine hesitancy.  I am expecting that report any day now and by the end of the year.  I will read it alongside the advice of the Attorney General and come forward with policy proposals.<\/p><p>My view is that there may be issues with the Constitution in the context of education and schools.  People have a constitutional right to a primary education.  How a constitutional rights interacts with a particular issue may present a challenge.  If, however, we are really serious about vaccination, we know that it happens prior to primary school.  It actually happens when children are in cr&egrave;ches and other childcare facilities.<\/p><p> I make a plea to Early Childhood Ireland and others regarding the fact that there is nothing stopping cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers from making it a requirement for parents to show that their children have been vaccinated in order for them to be accepted by those facilities.  This has become the norm in terms of how we deal with our family pets.  It is quite astonishing that it is not the norm when it comes to dealing with children.  If I were to send my child to a cr&egrave;che, I would like to know that not only have I done right by her in terms of getting her vaccinated but that she is going into an environment where she cannot pick up other illness because other people have failed in their duties to protect public health.  All of us should be calling on cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers to make this part of good practice and guidelines from today.  I do not think there is any reason that this should not happen.<\/p><p> In terms of the Deputy's question regarding an effective campaign, I have heard her talk about how we can have an effective campaign for the generation that were not vaccinated - the Wakefield generation, as the Deputy refers to them.  She is dead right.  It is a really important campaign that we could run in colleges, etc.  The Vaccine Alliance is looking at what is effective in terms of public awareness campaigns.  I will certainly feed that back to it.  The final point I want to make on vaccinations is that I had meetings with the social media companies recently.  Social media has been a really great tool but would Brexit have happened, would Donald Trump have been elected, and would the uptake rate relating to the HPV vaccine have dropped so significantly if we did not have social media?  Who knows.  We certainly know that the spread of disinformation and misinformation on social media has contributed significantly to a decrease in vaccination rates, particularly around the HPV vaccine but also in respect of other vaccines.  At the meetings, I was encouraged somewhat that they were doing some things and that they are certainly realising even from a business model point of view that their users expect them to do more.  I am still a little concerned with Google wanting to keep as its \"secret sauce\" information relating to how one becomes the number one hit on a Google search.  When I search the word \"vaccination\" on Google, I do not think it is acceptable that I get anything other than a reputable source of information at the top of the results list.  We have agreed to keep in touch and work with Google.  It has agreed to come in and speak to the Vaccine Alliance.  A lot more work definitely needs to be done in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#PP00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Mr. Breslin, Mr. Reid and a few others were present at last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss primary care centres.  I do not want to land the issue on them this morning but, in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare, it is fundamental that we move things out of acute settings and into the primary care setting.  There were 341 primary care centres planned from 2008 onwards.  The matter was reviewed in 2012.  It emerged at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week that no one has reviewed position of the centres in light of Sl&aacute;intecare in order to see if they are fit for purpose in terms of what we want to deliver.  There is no definition of what constitutes a primary care centre or a primary care team.  While I am not completely hung up on that, if we are going to move towards treating defined populations, then, in the context of the connection between acute care and community care, it is imperative that the system that was embarked upon in 2008 is modified and made fit for purpose.  If we are going to add diagnostic centres, we have to ensure that capacity exists among the 341 that are planned.  Obviously, we cannot have 341 diagnostic centres but capacity must be there - dotted around the country - and it must be possible to add things so that we are not going to have to buy sites next to centres or whatever.  When we are doing Sl&aacute;intecare, it is about ensuring that we are not already tying a stone to our leg while we are doing it.  We should be able to do it with the plans that are already there.  We can modify them as we go.

The first element is GPs, the second is pharmacies, and the third is the primary care centres, both in terms of entry points and egress points.  In my visits to many such centres around the country, I have seen various levels of capability and resourcing.  Centres that have a GP on-site, such as the one I visited last week in Waterford, are very successful.  Young children and those seeking paediatric services come in to them as well, which takes huge pressure off the acute settings.  The centres are very successful when they have the skills and resources in place.  There are other that are fine centres but which do not have the skills, resources, and diagnostics needed to equip them.  As we look forward to Sl&aacute;intecare and talk about new pathways, I am very committed that the investment in the next 77 centres and the infrastructure of the current 127 must be Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed.  In terms of the existing centres, the first element is the &euro;10 million investment committed to in our service plan, as part of the budget, which will rise to &euro;60 million.  That will give us the capacity for 1,000 extra resources on the community side, of which a significant proportion must be in our primary care centres. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#QQ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>There are five non-members here, who I will group in the interests of time.

I have two quick questions.  I welcome the fact that the HSE is providing funding for 15 beds to be opened at St. John's hospital in Limerick.  However, I have learned from my own inquiries made on Monday that those 15 beds have not been in use for the last three months.  At the same time, there is continuous and severe overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick.  By all means, we should push for the new MRI scanner there, because it would be fantastic.  Why were those 15 beds not put into use three months ago, when there is such a big crisis in Limerick on a continual basis?<\/p> <p>  The building of the 60-bed block is under way, and the 90-bed block will be going in for planning permission shortly.  What measures is the HSE taking, at both national and local level, to ensure all existing bed capacity is being used?  What is being done to ensure all the beds in University Hospital Limerick, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom hospitals are being used on an ongoing basis?  I was shocked to hear that 15 of the 89 beds in St. John's have been out of use for the last three months.  That is unforgivable and unacceptable.  It was a breaking point and a red line for me.  The Government is willing to give whatever resources are required, so I need an answer to these questions.  When did the witnesses first know about the 15 beds and why were they not brought into use three months ago?  What is being done to manage the beds in the five hospitals in the group, namely, UHL, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom?  I was at a mass in a village in east Limerick on Sunday, where nursing homes were advertising that they have spare capacity.  Is due diligence is being done to ensure available nursing home beds and step-down facilities are being used?  I am looking for solutions here.  Deputy Kelly noted that we are all looking for solutions, and we must use the existing resources to the maximum.  I ask the witnesses to address why the 15 beds in St. John's were not put to use three months ago, and whether we are making use of all the available bed capacity in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#RR00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>First, Mr. Reid's synopsis of how to deal with the entry point crisis in emergency departments is identical to what the Sl&aacute;intecare report came up with.  The primary focus is the treatment of patients elsewhere in the community.  The question is how quickly we can make that happen.  I welcome Mr. Reid's inclusion of a bigger input from the pharmacy community, with which I agree.  I take this opportunity to recognise that the proposed cuts to pharmacy funding are no longer going ahead, for which I thank the Minister and acknowledge his work in the area.  I would add the use of electronic records in emergency departments to fast-track patients, monitor waiting times etc. to Mr. Reid's synopsis.<\/p><p>Our health budget of over &euro;17 billion is up there among developed countries, as it is a high spend <i>per capita<\/i>.  Based on his six months in the job, does Mr. Reid think it possible to start getting value for the money we are spending?  Cataract operations are still being carried out in the North of Ireland on a regular basis, for example.  Buses go up there from Kerry and Cork.  I send patients up there on public transport and they are seen within a number of weeks.  Yet, every time I submit a query to the HSE about a cataract operation for a constituent, I receive the standard reply that the waiting list is 18 to 24 months.  Surely there is a better way of doing this.  We give that money back to these patients, so it is coming out of the same pot.  It is quicker and more convenient for a patient in the far south of Ireland to travel up to Belfast to get a cataract procedure done.  I cannot see any reason why the system in this country cannot deal with that.<\/p><p>Mr. Reid also spoke about delayed discharges-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#SS00100","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Time, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#SS00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I am nearly done.

My analysis is definitely in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have not invented anything different.  However, I have seen a significant amount of innovation all across our acute and community settings.  While Sl&aacute;intecare is a new direction in terms of pathways to care and devolved regions, we can also scale up and roll out much of what is good in our hospital and community settings.  I have seen a significant amount of that in terms of emergency departments, process flow, oversight of bed capacity within a unit, electronic monitoring of beds and centrally managed hubs.  We can scale up and roll out much of that innovation, on top of the direction of flight of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p><p>We have to scale up better pathways for treatment.  That requires more GPs, more primary care investment and more utilisation of pharmacies.  I agree about electronic solutions.  Electronic health records will take time and investment.  We know it works where we have put it in place.  There is a shorter pathway we can take, which is to have a shared record of patients' care between the GP and the acute setting the Chairman has been talking about quite a bit.  That is an incremental step that we can take in advance of the major investment in the electronic health records.<br\/><br\/>On budget spend, outcomes and related issues, an OECD report was published in the past couple of weeks.  It is quite good and has a synopsis of this.  It demonstrates that health expenditure is above the EU <i>per capita<\/i>average.  Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost six years since 2000.  The report also states that our general public healthcare is comparable with other OECD countries.  It highlights some particular issues that we have with obesity and alcohol, and the demands that places on our services.  It is a good report and I recommend browsing it.  We have a high standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#SS00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>There is a significant difference between being alive and living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#TT00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Sure.  On wider issues, I made a point earlier about the investment that we have made.  We have an extra &euro;1 billion in health expenditure this year compared to last year, an increase of 6.3%.  From what I have seen, investment in the areas we have spoken about is key, as is investing in a different way for the future.  We are finalising next year's service plan at the minute and it will start to make that step.  As the Deputy will be aware, the way that we can relieve the pressure on acute settings is by investment in community settings.  Our service plan for next year starts to make that shift in an incremental way, which is valuable.  There is a challenge for us, as I said in our opening statement, about how we manage with the funds that we have in an effective manner to make the right decisions and investments, and to hold local management to account.  It has to be about safety, improving access and managing within a budget.  Those are three relative challenges that have to be run in parallel, though they are not always conflicting.<\/p> <p>  I made the point in my opening statement that we have done the State some good this year with our oversight of the health spend.  The overrun will be less than half that of last year.  The overrun last year was &euro;650 million plus a &euro;150 million first charge for the following year.  It will be significantly less than half of that by the outturn this year.  That has largely been through the discipline of working with line managers, holding people to account and making sure that we are recruiting in the right places.  I know recruitment has been difficult for everybody.  We have to make sure we are recruiting where we have a budget and that we are recruiting skills that add to service delivery.  The point I made earlier is that we are looking at the centre of the HSE to see what size it should be in the future.  I believe it should be scaled down and that we should devolve more of what we have in the HSE centre to the regions to some hospital acute settings and community settings.  We have to look at it very differently.  That is about management of finances.<\/p> <p>  With regard to lay discharges, I spent some time in Kerry in a hospital in an acute setting and in a community setting.  I was a little frustrated on the day I was there when it was highlighted that there were some beds available in the community and we had delayed discharges in our community setting.  We immediately convened a meeting that evening with the relevant CHO and the hospital manager.  The CHO has worked to increase capacity through a number of initiatives that it has put in place since.  Some beds were available in Killarney at the time and some of those are being utilised.  Some of that is now built into our winter action teams.  Kerry has a good interface and integration between community and acute settings.  A number of initiatives in community settings are giving relief to acute settings.  While they have a challenge in delayed discharges, they had some good initiatives working in a way that we want them to in the future.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#TT00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a specific question on St. John's hospital and why 15 beds are vacant.

The approach through winter is a key focus for us, to make sure that people are stepping out of the acute settings altogether and moving into relevant step-down facilities and transitional care.

I am curious as to why that &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; has not tweaked the Minister's interest in investigating what went wrong in the labs.  Consistently, in the highlighted court cases that we know of involving women who are still alive and women who have died, they successfully sued the laboratories and have been paid big sums, not out of the goodness of the hearts of those laboratories, but because &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; and, clearly, they are acknowledging that when they pay out vast sums.  I want to know why the Minister is not curious that &quot;something has gone wrong&quot;, and why we are not examining what went wrong in those labs.<br\/><br\/>I will give a quick analogy.  If there was an accident at Dublin Airport and five or six people were killed, would we investigate the causes and what might have gone wrong, or would we say that those deaths are within the statistical norms of aviation globally, Dublin Airport is working to appropriate health and safety standards, so why would we bother investigating what went wrong?  I would like an answer from the Minister as to why he is not interested in investigating what went wrong in those labs.  It is connected with my consistent appeal for the figures in regard to which labs the 221+ women's smear tests were carried out in.  I am curious as to why that does not bother the Minister.  He is comparing the results of the RCOG report for Ireland with the results for the NHS.  However, the NHS has acknowledged that sometimes things go wrong but we do not seem to acknowledge or own up to it.<br\/><br\/>I believe the Minister is going to reopen the audit, which has been closed for a year and a half.  In that year and half, some women have had serious results.  The best friend of my secretary, who works in Leinster House, is dying from cervical cancer.  She was under constant screening because she had a procedure in 2009.  The woman, her community and her friends have had to fundraise to have the audit carried out privately and it has cost thousands of euro.  It has shown that, in four previous years, the screening had serious, discordant results that were not picked up and then, all of a sudden, she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  What can the Minister do for women who are caught between the date the audit closed and when it is going to reopen.  When will it reopen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#VV00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I apologise but I have to attend a vote in the Seanad.

With regard to the protocols for transition to get new teenagers going, a lot of preparation is done before 18 year olds move into adult services.  Approximately 1,600 people, having hit 18, come into adult services every year.  The good news is that we managed to secure an extra &euro;13 million to develop these services and to keep them safe.  Every 18 year old that comes out of youth services is now guaranteed a place at an adult day service.  That is essential.  There has to be preparation for that transition.  Most sensible services provide that a few months before people move on to a new service.  Many services provide key workers, link workers and meetings with families and parents.  If members have any concerns about a particular service, they should not hesitate to contact me because we have to ensure that transitions are as stable as possible for people, and particularly for adults with autism, as these transitions can be very difficult for them and for their families.

The Senator is quite correct in saying that there has been knowledge about valproate for many years.  This knowledge was heightened, as it were, in February 2018 when the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions.  Following that, we instituted a communications and support programme to increase awareness among women of childbearing age.  Through working with OACS Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, and a support team we established, we identified 40 families who may have been affected by valproate.  Through that we developed a diagnostic pathway in Crumlin hospital, again working with the agencies I mentioned and members of OACS Ireland, including a consultant geneticist and paediatrician.  Following on from that pathway, some of these patients and their families will require supports.  We are committed to providing those supports.  The Senator is, however, absolutely correct.  There has been knowledge about anticonvulsants in pregnancy for many years.  It is also true that the degree of the knowledge and the strength of the evidence has become more powerful over time.  Our response has, therefore, become more powerful over time.  From her own work, the Senator will know that people have been alerted to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy.  As part of this work, we are introducing nurse practitioners to work in the area of women in pregnancy who are on anticonvulsants, in recognition of the greater risk presented by these drugs, even beyond valproate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#XX00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I believe the Senator asked about a report.

As we know from the laboratory report provided here, the number of false negatives is very small in the context of the overall workload of the laboratory.  It is therefore very difficult to draw conclusions.  There are other measures which are equally, if not more, important such as the number of false positives.  These can cause much distress and unnecessary interventions and, in some cases, invasive surgery.  Another measure is the number of high-grade findings.  Because of the huge numbers in each laboratory, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the report.<\/p><p>One other point worth making is on the timeline of the cervical cancer screening programme which started in 2008.  One would have expected a higher degree of findings at the beginning of the programme because no screening programme had existed beforehand.  There are a number of confounders when one tries to examine the relative performance of false negatives in each laboratory, for example, the timing of the laboratory for the programme and the demographics, that is, the population that that laboratory will serve.  <\/p><p> On interval cancer, I acknowledge that Deputy Kelly showed an interest in this matter in previous hearings.

As has been acknowledged, this was due to an inability to staff the unit and recruit consultant paediatricians.  The Tallaght urgent care centre is planned for 2020.  Does the HSE have a staffing plan in place?  The number of consultants in the system appears to be insufficient, with a shortfall to the tune of 500.  The Minister will be aware that the consultants have expressed no confidence in him and that view is shared by many.  I do not intend that in a personal way but it is a matter of public record.  We have a recruitment and retention crisis among consultants.  We discussed the case of a pain consultant for Crumlin earlier.  The urgent care centre is only open on a nine-to-five basis at the moment, which is not what was promised, and the centre in Tallaght is due to open in 2020.  Will it open on time?

I am sure the Deputy will stand with me when I table proposals shortly to pay consultants much more money.  In return, however, consultants will be expected to work in the public health service.  It will also be expected that public beds will used for public practice and public patients, as in the case that was so well articulated by the Deputy earlier.  It may make the Deputy politically uncomfortable but on this issue, I believe the gap or difference between us is smaller than on many other issues.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has not yet made its position clear on this issue, whereas the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael have.  We believe consultants should be paid much more but if they want to do private practice, they should do it in private hospitals, not in our public hospitals.  We will have to pay them much more to do that.  <\/p> <p>  There is no free money here.  Nurses and midwives did not get any free money.  When they were offered an enhanced contract, better pay and conditions and improved career prospects, they agreed to a number of changes to work practices, as did our GPs.  So too will our pharmacists and dentists, and likewise our consultants.  No one is protected beyond reproach or scrutiny.  I am certainly not but nobody else is either.<\/p> <p>  We will have a plan on Tallaght.  I am sure Ms &Eacute;ilish Hardiman, the chief executive officer of Children's Health Ireland, who is responsible for this facility, can brief the committee on this matter.  The Tallaght urgent care centre is due to open towards the end of next year.  We will have tabled significant proposals long in advance of that offering consultants much more money to work in the public health service and I emphasis the public aspect of the health service.  I need to make this point, because one will not hear it anywhere else.  Throughout the 2000s - the years of economic boom - there were approximately 7,000 doctors working in the Irish public health service.  There are now more than 10,000 doctors in the health service.  While we have vacancies and there is more to do, there are approximately 3,000 more doctors working in our public hospitals than there were in 2007, 2008 and 2009.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#AAA01100","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I listened to Mr. Reid's comments on overcrowding in accident and emergency departments and I accept his point on changes that have to be made in other areas to ensure these problems are solved.  I am with him 100% on that but the problem of resources is staring us in the face.<\/p><p>If I see changes in resources, particularly the area I pointed out, I will go with the Minister immediately.  If I do not see changes in resources, I will not because the Minister ultimately has that choice to make.  I have pointed this out numerous times.  I am staying with him but only for a short time because if he does not deal with the resources gap, that is his issue.  That is just reality.<\/p><p> Will he respond regarding John Wall and the medical card?  Deputy O'Reilly, myself and others have raised this.  It is a genuine case and a genuine issue for terminally ill patients.  We should react positively.  <\/p><p> I previously raised an issue with the Minister and Mr. Reid of a woman for whom it cost more than &euro;100,000 to get her gallbladder out.  That happened over 11 weeks and involved two hospitals.  I never received a response.  How can a gallbladder operation cost more than &euro;100,000 and how can someone spend 11 weeks in hospital?  It is insane and multiple hospitals are involved as well as the public-private issue.  It was meant to be investigated but I never received an answer.  <\/p><p> On 5 December at 2.25 p.m. a letter issued from the HSE stating that all the people in the RCOG review were not getting the &euro;2,000.  I welcome what the Minister and the Taoiseach have done today but the fact is that the people around the Minister here, representing the HSE, wrote to the 221+ group and told them they would not get it.  There is no joined-up thinking.  The Minister might reflect on that.  Why did that happen?   <\/p><p> I refer to the Bernadette Kiely case, and I mention her name only because it is public, in the context of non-disclosure and the issues surrounding that.  Representatives from RCOG will be before the committee next week but has the Minister initial concerns he would like to share with us?  How does he feel when Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap, Vicky Phelan - people whom he knows well, as do I - say they have no confidence in the RCOG review?  If these people do not have confidence based on what we publicly know, that is scary.  Why in that review was there a default that anyone whose slides could not be found were sent concordant letters?  Surely they should have been concordant and discordant, and a small number should have said there was something missing and a decision could not be made.  That would have been logical.  I refer to those who have serious concerns about the credibility of the review.  I was not filled with encouragement last week when the college was unable to answer some basic questions.  A small number of these women would like an independent assessment of their files.  I am sure that will happen anyway, but unlike the now-resolved matter of the &euro;2,000, can we please just deal with this now and give a positive answer to the question?  I do not think there is a large number of women in this category who would voluntarily want to go down this route but there is a significant number.  For the cost involved, the Minister should just do so.  I ask that he consider that.          <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#AAA01300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Henry to comment on some of the RCOG matters.

In terms of where we are now with the existing cohort, it is my understanding that when female patients who have epilepsy talk to their GPs about having a family, they are moved from valproate to levetiracetam or something more suitable to a hospital environment.  They get an infusion and come off valproate before starting a family.

In putting together this particular programme, we had to bear in mind that we did not want to alarm people who might, for example, have unstable epilepsy.  We did not want them to stop taking their medications abruptly which could cause greater harm.  The whole thrust of the programme was to ensure that they got the best and most expert advice, balancing the risks of changing or coming off medication against staying on medication which might harm a developing foetus.  The bigger question to the Deputy refers is access to specialist care and advice.  I presume she is not just interested in valproate but in other anticonvulsant drugs.  Working with the epilepsy programme, led by Dr. Colin Doherty, we are developing a specific programme.  We have now appointed two out of a planned six specialist nurses for pregnant women who are on anticonvulsant medication so that we can target them early with primary care and afford them the best advice.  We want to ensure that their epilepsy remains stable because abrupt withdrawal can be quite harmful.  We also want to make sure that they are on the safest possible medication at the safest dose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#DDD01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I would see a role for community pharmacists here because they are the people who generally sell the folic acid and pregnancy tests and who also dispense medication to patients with long-term illnesses.  They are very much aware of patients' history and in well-established community pharmacies, they would have seen girls growing up and going through different phases of treatment.<\/p><p>While I am in favour of specialist nurses, I am of the view that there is a role for community pharmacists here in terms of explaining the science.  What is commonly lost in the chat about valproate is the issue of balance, as just described by Dr. Henry.  The risk to the woman and to the pregnancy of abruptly stopping medication must be weighed up.  If a woman with an unplanned pregnancy who is on valproate turns up at a doctor's surgery, she should be told that just stopping is not the solution.  That point is often lost in the argument.<\/p><p> On the RCOG report, Deputy Kelly stated that he is not filled with encouragement.  I am of the opposite view, particularly having met representatives from RCOG.  I felt that they were full of integrity and that their independence was guaranteed.  Perhaps their answers are not the answers that some of us wanted to hear but the answers we got in the private briefing last week gave me some solace.  I now feel that the future might be better.  There have been constant calls for a reopening of the audit process.  To my mind, this all went wrong with the audit.  Somebody decided to conduct an audit without considering how to deal with the results and with the fact that real people were involved, either deceased women's families or women who had adverse outcomes.  Consideration was not given to the results, the impact of same or the issue of open disclosure, and all of that fed into this crisis for people.  It is important that there is some balance here.  While I was not necessarily filled with encouragement, I felt confident that the RCOG representatives were independent and were not in the pocket of anyone, as has been suggested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#DDD01600","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I agree completely.

The Minister of State will say a few words later about his area of responsibility.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate being presented is technical in its nature as it does not seek any additional allocation from the Exchequer.  The Estimate is seeking to redistribute some &euro;15.289 million in savings to support particular priorities regarding several of the Department&rsquo;s enterprise, innovation and regulation programmes.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate seeks to provide an additional &euro;500,000 in capital funding to InterTradeIreland to support its Brexit activities, in particular its programme of voucher supports.  Demand for InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit planning vouchers and its Brexit implementation vouchers supports has remained high throughout 2019.  It spiked in advance of the two Brexit deadlines in March and in October.  Almost 1,800 of these vouchers have been approved by InterTradeIreland.  The additional &euro;500,000 being provided through the Supplementary Estimate, which builds upon additional funding provided in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, will be targeted at meeting the increasing demands for InterTradeIerland&rsquo;s services for the remainder of 2019.<\/p> <p>  The INTERREG programme is one of 60 cross-border funding programmes throughout the EU.  The current round of INTERREG, which runs from 2016 to 2022, is jointly funded by the Department and our Northern Ireland counterparts, the Department for the Economy, on a 30:70 basis.  The Department&rsquo;s overall commitment under this round of the programme is &euro;21 million.  The additional &euro;1.2 million being provided to the INTERREG programme in the Supplementary Estimate will increase the overall provision to the programme to &euro;4.2 million in 2019.  For several reasons, the drawdown in the initial years of this round of the programme was much less than anticipated.  The &euro;1.2 million being provided through the Supplementary Estimate is required to ensure that the Department meets its overall funding commitment within the lifetime of this round of the programme.<\/p> <p>  The future growth loan scheme, which was launched in April of this year, provides long-term financing support to Irish businesses to help them strategically invest in a post-Brexit environment.  The scheme operates alongside the Brexit loan scheme, which provides shorter term working capital to businesses that have been impacted by Brexit.  In the period since the launch of the scheme in April 2019, some 2,000 applications have been approved by the scheme&rsquo;s administrators, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The uptake in the scheme has increased significantly in recent months and the additional &euro;2 million being provided through the Supplementary Estimate will ensure that the SBCI can continue, in conjunction with the participating lenders, to meet this increased level of demand.<\/p> <p>  The humanitarian relief scheme is intended to provide humanitarian support for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies that experience flood damage to their premises as a consequence of a severe weather event and have been refused flood insurance.  The &euro;59,000 being sought through the Supplementary Estimate arises from claims relating to flood damage suffered in County Donegal in the aftermath of Storm Lorenzo in October 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will set out the details of the various innovation programmes receiving additional funding through the Supplementary Estimate in his statement later.  Of the total of &euro;11.279 million in additional innovation supports being provided through the Supplementary Estimate, &euro;2.55 million will be provided to the science and technology development programme, &euro;1.999 million to the programme for research in third level institutions and &euro;6.73 million to subscriptions to international organisations.<\/p> <p>  The remaining element of the Estimate involves the provision of an additional &euro;251,000 to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  While the board is essentially self-funded, the Department provides funding to the board in respect of pension payments.  The additional &euro;251,000 being provided to subhead C9 through the Supplementary Estimate reflects the costs of unexpected retirements by members of staff of the board in 2019.<\/p><p> The savings funding our 2019 Supplementary Estimate have been generated in the following programmes: administration pay savings of &euro;448,000; agency legacy pensions savings of &euro;500,000; IDA Ireland savings of &euro;2.1 million; Enterprise Ireland savings of &euro;8 million; workplace relations programme savings of &euro;1.115 million; Health and Safety Authority savings of &euro;375,000; Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement savings of &euro;1.4 million; Competition and Consumer Protection Commission savings of &euro;500,000; and Companies Registration Office savings of &euro;850,000.  The briefing provided by my officials to the committee's secretariat sets out the details of the circumstances giving rise to the savings in each of the aforementioned subheads.  I am happy to discuss these further with the members of the committee.  The committee will see, however, that more than 60% of the savings have been generated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, which account for &euro;8 million and &euro;2.1 million, respectively, of the savings.<\/p><p> Regarding the IDA, the savings of &euro;2.1 million essentially arise in respect of its property programme.  Large-scale capital investment in land and property such as that engaged in by the IDA is a complex and lengthy process.  The inherently complex nature of property and land development transactions, which involve acquisition, engagement with stakeholders, including local authorities, complicated commercial arrangements and building contracts, can, and often does, involve delays.  Nevertheless, regional development remains a top priority for the IDA.  In this regard construction of advance buildings in Dundalk and Galway is almost completed.  The construction of buildings in Carlow and Athlone will begin in 2020.<\/p><p> Regarding savings in Enterprise Ireland, the committee will be aware that in addition to the funding it receives from the Exchequer, Enterprise Ireland generates income from equity investments that it makes in the companies it supports.  Enterprise Ireland is permitted, subject to the approval and sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to retain and use own-resource income, ORI, in support of enterprise development.  Enterprise Ireland has succeeded in generating a significant surfeit of ORI in excess of the amount sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the course of 2019.  Under public expenditure rules, Enterprise Ireland is required to expend ORI before drawing down Exchequer funds.  Accordingly, the additional ORI generated by EI essentially means it will not need to call on its full 2019 Exchequer capital allocation of &euro;65.75 million under subhead A7 of the Department's Vote, thus generating a saving on this subhead.<\/p><p> I hope I have given the committee an overview of the various expenditure and savings elements of the technical Supplementary Estimate I have presented to members.  With the Chairman's permission I now ask the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to give some further details of the additional funding being provided to the Department's innovation programmes through the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#B00400","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce very briefly the elements of the Supplementary Estimate relating to research and innovation.  Under the Department's proposed allocation, just over &euro;11 million would be apportioned to meet commitments in respect of various research and development programmes of national importance.  This will help us to accelerate delivery against our targets and goals as set out in Innovation 2020.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;5 million Supplementary Estimate funding for the European Space Agency, ESA, will be invested across six technology development programmes to drive Ireland forward as a competitive player in the space sector.  This investment is directly aligned with the new national space strategy for enterprise, which I published earlier this year and which aims to increase public and private investment in the ESA by 50% by 2025 and develop a strong and economically sustainable space-active industry in Ireland.  As I have noted previously in committee and in the D&aacute;il, our investment through the ESA delivers a sevenfold return in terms of its ultimate impact.  It is critical that we increase our ambition in this area.<\/p> <p>  The specific programmes in which we will invest include telecommunications and integrated applications, exploration, transportation and earth observation.  An additional &euro;1.7 million will be paid to the European Southern Observatory as a contribution to our existing membership liabilities, including the joining fees, which are to be paid over a number of years, and Ireland's contribution to the extremely large telescope, ELT.  Membership of the ESO affords Irish astronomers and researchers the opportunity to be part of an international scientific community conducting groundbreaking research in the most advanced facilities.  ESO membership will grow Ireland's skill base in high-tech areas, delivering on the ambitions of Future Jobs Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The proposed allocation of &euro;1.5 million for Tyndall National Institute in Cork will contribute towards upgrading works to accommodate more researchers in the field of cutting-edge ICT.  This funding will enhance Tyndall's ability to support innovation and deliver significant economic benefit in the form of highly skilled jobs, new start-up activity and investment.<\/p> <p>  An additional &euro;1 million is proposed for Science Foundation Ireland for a number of existing commitments that fall due in 2019.  Taken together with increases in its capital funding in 2020, SFI will be able to fund additional research activity through both its research centres and its funding for individual awards.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;2 million for cycle 5 of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, will address existing financial commitments under that programme.  The PRTLI has supported investment in top-class infrastructure and human capital development across Ireland's higher education institutions.  It has been an important programme for creating the foundation on which further investments by SFI and our other funding agencies now build.<\/p> <p>  The evolution of research, development and innovation and its associated investment have been a cornerstone of Ireland's enterprise policy for many years.  In order to become an innovation leader, it is essential Ireland keeps apace with and anticipates developments in the field.  This ambition must be matched by investment in innovation, research and development and reflected in the above funding decisions.  This supplementary allocation of just over &euro;11 million will provide welcome additional funding into our system, support the quality and impact of our scientific capacity, contribute to our job creation and enterprise growth and help us to deliver on our Innovation 2020 targets and commitments as we look to the future.  Again, I welcome the opportunity to give a very brief introduction as to where this &euro;11 million is being invested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#C00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.  I will start with the Minister of State.  He spoke about the &euro;5 million Supplementary Estimate for the European Space Agency and said an additional &euro;1.7 million will be paid to the European Southern Observatory.  As he is aware, research and innovation are vital for the Irish economy, and membership of international research organisations is an important part of increasing our own research output.  Ireland is currently one of only three European countries that does not have any formal agreement with CERN, which I know the Minister of State is very supportive of.  Innovation 2020's vision is for Ireland to be a global innovation leader driving a strong, sustainable economy and a better society.  If Ireland is to deliver on this vision, membership of organisations such as CERN, which are at the forefront of innovation, is critical.  The committee recently did a body of work on CERN and we launched our document in the past month.  I wish to put the following to the Minister of State strongly on behalf of all the joint committee members.  Some of them are not here, and I am probably straying slightly outside the committee's remit, but at the same time it is a great opportunity to put this to the Minister of State.  While concerns have been raised that Ireland may not be in a position to take advantage of all the potential benefits of membership of CERN, the committee believes that joining CERN, even as an associate member, which would initially cost &euro;1.3 million, would create an environment that would encourage Irish researchers and businesses to take maximum advantage of these opportunities.  The committee has made a number of observations and recommends that negotiations start with CERN with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  I hope we will get the opportunity to discuss the Estimates for 2020 next year but I just wanted to put out a marker on behalf of every member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation that we fully support the Department starting negotiations with CERN with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member.  Could I hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this?<\/p><p>Of course the Chairman can.  I acknowledge that CERN is one of the largest international research organisations in the world.  It is a leading research collaboration investigating the fundamental composition of matter.  The Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 that we would initiate discussions with several international research organisations.  Discussions with CERN started in 2016.  As a matter of fact, an Irish delegation visited CERN in 2016 and we met the director general.  The Department has been proactive in advancing Ireland's membership of CERN.  Representatives of CERN met me and departmental officials some months ago.  We continue to keep the position on CERN membership and its cost under review and we continue to contact officials in CERN.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its support because I am a great supporter of joining CERN.  I hope to visit CERN in January to continue further discussions.  I should tell the committee that based on the indications received from CERN the cost of Ireland's full membership, and I believe we should have full membership, at current prices would be approximately &euro;13.6 million annually, which is substantial money.  To become a full member, a country must go through associate membership prior to membership.<\/p><p> We are continuing negotiations with CERN.  It is my view and that of the Department that we should join CERN.  We will continue negotiations with CERN over the coming months.  I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance about CERN.  I hope to have further meetings with the Minister for Finance in the coming months before I go to CERN.  I support the committee.  CERN is a premier international research organisation.  Believe it or not, it is conducting research in 2,000 areas.  I know a good deal about CERN and we should join it.  I fully support the committee.  Unfortunately, I have not given the Chairman a direct answer.  The Minister will have to give that answer.  If the Chairman were to ask whether the Government supports joining CERN, it does and it is in our programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#C00300","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>To be quite clear, the committee felt that if we took a baby step first it might be helpful to the Department because there is a lot of money involved.  The committee recommended that negotiations with CERN start immediately with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  The committee then recommended that after three years of associate membership the Department would conduct a cost-benefit analysis and assess whether there is a case to be made for moving towards full membership.  The committee also recommended that efforts should be made to fund the annual fee for associate membership, which we were told is &euro;1.3 million, within the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation Vote.  We felt we were trying to lead the Department towards it.  I know many in the Department are supportive.  We felt we should look at associate membership first and then, after three years, do a cost-benefit analysis to see what benefits we could get from full membership of CERN, and try to find initial funding from within the budget.  We felt we took appropriate steps in this respect.

In the same way as with the European Space Agency, what we put in we get back.

Importantly, the return from our &euro;18.3 million annual investment in the European Space Agency has been continuously improving, as demonstrated by the value of the contracts in Ireland, which has increased from &euro;13.9 million in 2017 to more than &euro;21 million.  There is no doubt in my mind that whatever investment we make in CERN we would get back.

I know this can be doubled or trebled with the same input.  The members of the joint committee were unanimous on this.  At the launch four weeks ago, 21 academics from every institute of technology and university in Ireland were present and they were excited for the first time.

We all meet representatives of the agency in our constituencies and they often give the same reason for their inability to make important investments.  I refer, for example, to Mullingar, where an IDA park lies almost empty.  If the &euro;2.1 million was invested there for an advanced manufacturing factory or a hub ready for future investment, it would be most welcome.  The issue needs to be examined.  In fairness to the Minister, she stated it is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it is up to her to push that Department to try to change the direction.  It would be beneficial for the IDA in future.<\/p> <p>  Health and safety in the workplace is critical.  Will the Minister confirm that the savings at the Health and Safety Authority will have no impact on the work it does and that it will not compromise the health and safety of any employees?<\/p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has undergone many hours of discussion by the committee in respect of critical legislation and of the essential information the committee needs to advance that legislation.  The office has to do a great deal of work.<\/p><p>Anybody looking at the Football Association of Ireland at present would wonder how, in the name of God, &euro;1 million can be diverted from an office that has so much important work to do.  The reason is the lack of progress in key legislation.  I know the Minister is not holding it up but we should use this opportunity to highlight the need for the information required by this committee to advance the legislation.<\/p><p> There are savings of &euro;8 million with Enterprise Ireland.  Will the Minister outline to us a little further where Enterprise Ireland generates its own resources?  Why is there a slowing down in drawing down supports that Enterprise Ireland makes available at a time when so many of our businesses are facing the Brexit challenge?  One would expect an increase in the demand needed for Enterprise Ireland supports.<\/p><p> There are savings of &euro;500,000 with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  This is the agency to which the Minister has referred matters relating to the insurance industry and requested an in-depth audit into practices.  That agency's representatives have come before this Oireachtas committee in the past quarter and have indicated the commission does not have sufficient powers and particularly sanctioning powers.  When will we consider giving this body the powers it requires, particularly at a time it is conducting invaluable work in the consumer interest?

It is a result of slower than expected drawing down on a number of Enterprise Ireland programmes.  Enterprise Ireland also invests equity in companies and when they become profitable, the money comes back to Enterprise Ireland.  The body received an increase in its budget last year and it was not able to spend all the income.  It had to use its own resource income first and there was therefore a surplus.  I was able to move it to other pressing needs.<\/p> <p>  The savings in the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, arise as a result of delays in filling new staff posts.  There is a very competitive recruitment market.  Nevertheless, the increases in funding provided to the HSA have enabled it to recruit 13 additional staff, with a number of other positions currently being filled.  The money is there but unfortunately the authority has not been able to get all the staff it wants.  The resources are available and as soon as staff are recruited, the money will be made available.

It was looking for 15 staff and it has recruited people for 13 posts.  There are two posts to be filled.  There may be a timing issue as well and some people may be coming on board, leading to this underspend.<\/p> <p>  There was a saving of &euro;1.4 million in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and I gave extra money to it last year specifically in anticipation that the legislation mentioned by the Deputy would be passed and it would be able to employ extra experts or specialists to deal with this forensic accounting.  The work done by the office is quite complex and its staff do it very well.  There have been delays in enacting the legislation to establish the new agency and the committee is very familiar with those.  When the pre-legislative scrutiny is finished, I will be ready to go.  We must get the committee's report before we can go any further.  I cannot do anything about this until the report comes from this committee.  We are ready and stand waiting to deal with that.  Another factor in this particular saving was that the provision included in the original Estimate with respect to legal costs was not fully required.  Sometimes legal costs do not materialise in a particular year.<\/p> <p>  There are savings of &euro;500,000 with the CCPC, which essentially arise as a result of expenditure on pay being less than estimated, which is mainly due to the significant staff churn in the CCPC.  All these agencies are the same as businesses across the country, in that they are competing for talent.  I have offered more resources to the commission to help it carry out the study of public liability insurance mentioned by the Deputy so it is a matter for it to try to recruit the people it needs.  We are here to support the commission in that in any way we can.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the powers of the CCPC.  It currently has a wide range of investigative powers provided for in the Consumer Protection Acts 2007 to 2014, the Competition Acts 2002 to 2017 and relevant statutory provisions made under those Acts.  It may also investigate suspected breaches of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The powers of the CCPC were increased significantly by both the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012 and the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  For example, there are powers to consider commitments by undertakings to be rules of court and extended elements of the Criminal Justice Act are to apply to serious competition law offences.  Very high penalties already apply to criminal offences under the Competition Acts.  For example, there are fines of up &euro;5 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is the higher, for an undertaking, and up to ten years in prison for a person, or both.<\/p> <p>  The Empowering National Competition Authorities, ECN+, directive is due to be transposed by 4 February 2021, and it will give the CCPC additional enforcement powers, including the introduction of non-criminal fines for breaches of European Union competition law.  It is my intention to transpose the ECN+ directive by means of primary legislation and I am considering further provisions for inclusion, subject to advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  Any additional measures will be reviewed with due regard to the recent recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on regulatory powers and corporate offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#F01000","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":521,"content":"<p>The Minister is acknowledging that she will make changes and increase the CCPC's powers in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#F01100","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Yes.

That saves me reading the first paragraph of our presentation.  We thank the joint committee for inviting us to present on the challenges facing minority sports and to talk about women in sport in Ireland.  I will talk about the road we have travelled recently and highlight some of the opportunities and challenges facing us as a minority sport.<\/p> <p>  Hockey Ireland is the national governing body for the sport of hockey in Ireland, doing its work in all 32 counties of Ireland in leading and developing the sport.  Hockey Ireland in its current form was established in 2000 as a result of the merger of the two pre-existing unions which governed men's and women's hockey separately.  We are now joined as one organisation.  Both pre-existing unions originated in the 19th century, in 1893 for the men and 1894 for the women.  The men's Irish Senior Cup was first played for in the season of 1893&ndash;94, making it the oldest field hockey cup competition in the world and one of the oldest cups in sport in Ireland and perhaps in the world.  The sport's 150 clubs and 280 schools are affiliated to Hockey Ireland through its branch network.  The Irish Universities Hockey Association, which governs the sport in Ireland's university system, is also affiliated to Hockey Ireland.<\/p><p>We have a total of 26,351 registered players, 17,339 women and 9,012 men.  Masters hockey is growing fast and makes it a sport for life.  Hockey Ireland is funded through the following mechanisms: membership fees; grants from Sport Ireland, Sport Northern Ireland and the Olympic Federation of Ireland; and partnerships with sponsors.  As is very particular to the minority sports we are not funded through TV revenues and receive only limited gate receipts.  From the point of view of women in sport, we currently boast a 65% female participation share.  However, there is much work to be done in other areas improving the female numbers.  We are focusing at present on the leaders in our sport; with programmes developing female coaches and umpires supported by the women in sport funding initiative.<\/p><p> In 2016, for the first time in over 100 years for Irish Hockey, the Irish men's team competed in an Olympic Games and finished tenth out of the 12 teams competing.  The year before, in 2015, the men stood on the podium with a bronze medal at the European Championships.  The Rio result was not what we had hoped for and we were disappointed, but the experience of the games was important, and it inspired hockey in Ireland.  In the evaluation after the games the lack of a proper high-performance structure in Hockey Ireland and uncertainty around funding were mentioned as factors affecting the result.  The men had to work or study and fundraise at the same time as preparing for the games.  Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland funding improved significantly and has enabled Hockey Ireland to engage a full-time performance director, provide better support to the players and increase the number of times the national teams can train.  The new national sports policy is extremely encouraging for the athletes and will have a significant impact on sport in Ireland.  Sponsorship is growing but, compared with the funding we get from Government, still limited.<\/p><p> In August 2018, in London's Queen Elizabeth Park, the venue of the London games, the Irish women's hockey team won the silver medal at the International Hockey Federation, FIH, world cup.  It was the most successful result ever for a senior team sport in Ireland.  No doubt the team had risen to this level with far fewer resources and finances than most of the opposition, but it was proved that we can reach the highest level.  Although we are a minority sport, the sport became instantly mainstream in the media and the team was met with a hero's welcome in Dublin, where 10,000 fans came to see their heroes.  The viewing figures from RT&Eacute; showed an average of 381,500 people watching that game with a share of 41% of all TV viewers at that moment, which is a pretty good figure.<\/p><p> The success had an immediate result - clubs had an influx of new members, or now have waiting lists for new members, or people became interested in the sport but there was no club in their area or no room in the club.  To sustain the growth of the sport, Hockey Ireland has had to enhance its strategy to develop the sport at grassroots level with development officers, and more coaches and umpires.  Clubs need facilities to play the sport and investment in hockey pitches spread over Ireland is crucial.  The number of under-18s entering the sport has been growing steadily over the past eight years.  However, year on year, the number of adults playing the sport remains level or is declining slightly.  In our last session on future strategy we recognised changes in the way people spend their time and the influence lifestyle changes and new technology have.  Our competition structure may need to move with the times, to shorten the engagement with the sport, or find other ways to reduce the time commitment of playing hockey regularly.<\/p><p> To promote the game, our grassroots introduction to hockey programmes, the hockey skills challenge and tricks for sticks attracted more than 16,000 players this year, but, as has been said, the growth at club level is hampered by capacity problems, as well as instances of insufficient numbers of skilled volunteers and club leaders.  We are also proud of the development of para-hockey in Ireland, a format for hockey players with intellectual disabilities providing national and international competition in hockey.  The silver medal for the women's team was not the end goal, this was on the road to something bigger, namely the Olympic Games in Tokyo.  Last month, the Olympic qualification reached its climax in a two-game challenge, on goal aggregate, against Canada.  The men travelled to Vancouver and missed out due to a controversial video umpire decision in the last seconds of the second game, reducing their 6-5 lead to 6-6 on aggregate with Canada winning 5-4 in the penalty shoot-out.  The women played at home in Dublin.  Hockey Ireland knew the interest in the games would be big and we installed a hockey pitch over the existing rugby pitch in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook.  It was only the second time ever that this technology was used, and it worked even in the torrential rain during the first game.  After full time in the second match the score was 0-0 and it went to a penalty shoot-out.  Ireland made a poor start to the shoot-out and found itself trailing 3-1, with Canada just one goal away from snatching the Olympic dream.  Then the green army came back to win 4-3 when the shoot-out went to sudden death.  The match also saw a record number in attendance with 6,137 spectators going through the gates on Sunday and on Saturday there was a similar number, the biggest crowd ever for a women's international team event in Ireland.<\/p><p> Nicci Daly, one of the players, who is also with us today, told RT&Eacute; on the night: \"It's everything.  The whole process, it's always for the Olympics.  We've come close in the past.  This is the dream.  This is everything to us. . . . and what a way to do it!\"  Meanwhile, captain Katie Mullen said: \"I'm just so incredibly proud of this bunch of players.  We have worked so hard, some of us have put in 10, 12 years, and it's also for all the players that have gone before us.  All those who committed so much of their lives to international hockey and never made it to an Olympics.  We are representing them.  I am so delighted!\"<\/p><p> The challenge now, and one of the points we want to make here today is that we must do whatever we can to support our athletes to maintain the level that this group has now achieved.  We need to provide the athletes with world-class support and facilities and the ability for them to focus completely on their performance.  The inspiration that the hockey players are giving as role models for young girls to take up hockey, or any other sport, is significant.  It is a promotion for Ireland, it makes people feel national pride and it gets people moving and being healthier.  The Government's investment in the new hockey pitch at the Sport Ireland campus will help our preparations for the games significantly.  It is important to get fully conditioned to the surface the team will find in Tokyo.  As one of the few top teams we can now practise on a pitch built to the exact same Poligras Tokyo GT standards as the Olympic arena.  The facilities at the Sport Ireland Institute are world class and the envy of many nations.  The joint approach between the Olympic Federation of Ireland and Sport Ireland in preparing for the games is significant and professional.<\/p><p> For minority sports, the Olympic Games are hugely important and even more so for team sports.  We are guaranteed at least five games in the opening phase for the country to get behind the green army and based on the viewing figures of the Olympic qualification and 2018 FIH World Cup, the Irish public will be following the team on television in large numbers.  The particular challenge of minority sports is that the interest in the sport will be at its highest at the Olympic Games, but commercial opportunities are limited as no team advertising is allowed at the games.  However, the attention will be a huge driver for participation.<\/p><p> These are exciting times for Hockey Ireland but they are also challenging.  While we have the opportunity to speak, there are a few other points that we and probably all Irish sports NGBs want to bring to your attention.  First, NGBs are facing significantly increased costs in insurance, which unfortunately is money that we have to pay and cannot use for the development of the sport.  Second, there may be ways of supporting the governing bodies by looking at the VAT regime for sport.  Some of our expenses - and this, for instance, was highly relevant when hosting the Olympic qualifiers - are subject to VAT that we cannot recover.  Finally, we get increased support from the commercial sector in the form of sponsorship but there is also significant interest in supporting the game at all levels through charitable donations and it would be great if tax benefits around such schemes could support the charitable activities of the federations.<\/p><p> I would like to hand over to Ms Lisa Jacob, a member of the board, who will finish our presentation with the board's perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Pels","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":553,"content":"<p>As a member of the Hockey Ireland board, I would like to take a little time to give the committee an insight into the current position in which the sport of hockey finds itself, the key challenges it faces and the broad strategic direction the board is proposing to take over the next three to five years.  I propose to speak to three key areas that together take up a significant part of the board&rsquo;s time and resources.  These areas broadly map to many of the key areas set out in the recent National Sports Policy 2018-2027.  The three areas I will focus on are governance; structures; and strategy, with particular reference to participation and development.<\/p> <p>  It is important to record that Hockey Ireland&rsquo;s approach to governance is led and informed by the principles of good governance as outlined in the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity, CVC, sector.  The board has a governance subcommittee which, on a \"comply or explain\" basis, monitors, reviews and updates or develops policies and other by-laws on an ongoing basis to meet the ever changing needs of the sport and its membership.  In fact, over the past 18 months the subcommittee has successfully completed a comprehensive update of the organisation's by-laws and policy documentation.  Governance is a regular item on board meeting agendas triggered by update reports from the subcommittee.  Our approach to governance also includes a new method for sourcing and recruiting members to the board.  We aspire to gender equality and look to provide a positive role model to our provinces and clubs in this regard.  This is evidenced by the fact that our 12-person board had until very recently a 50:50 gender split.  We believe we were one of the few sporting boards to achieve this level of equality.  However, due to the recent loss of one of our female board members, we currently have a 7:5 male to female split.  This still falls above the minimum best practice target of 40% which is set, for example, for State boards.  The presidency of Hockey Ireland, which rotates between the four provinces, also looks to ensure, where possible, that there is a gender rotation through each new presidential term.<\/p> <p>  On structures, Hockey Ireland has recently rolled out and implemented the first comprehensive database of its membership.  The introduction of this type of information system was a strategic priority in our last strategy and when fully operational will provide invaluable feedback that can be used for the benefit of the entire membership.  While there are a few outstanding gaps - namely umpires, schools, third level, and masters players to be added - the next big cohort of the hockey family to be accommodated is our volunteers, the lifeblood of the organisation on a day-to-day basis.  Members of Hockey Ireland are currently catered for through membership of their respective clubs which, in turn, are affiliated to their respective province.  The new database will help to link these members more closely to the national body and at the same time will provide the clubs and provinces with easy access to additional information such as lists of members with skill-sets such as coaching qualifications, umpire accreditation and administrative experience.<\/p> <p>  On strategy, Hockey Ireland caters for the hockey community on an all-island basis. This bring significant advantages but also adds a degree of complexity to the administrative process required to manage the sport across two different jurisdictions.  As with any sport there are areas of greater club and player density.  These are driven partly by an urban-rural divide but are also an artefact of the manner in which the sport was first introduced into the country over a hundred years ago.  From a board perspective this presents a significant opportunity as there are communities within both the urban and rural areas that are keenly interested in developing sport and in particular the sport of hockey.  The recent successes of the national senior men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s teams has served to create a positive impression of a sport that can be played throughout one&rsquo;s lifetime.  The men&rsquo;s participation at the Rio Olympics, the women&rsquo;s silver medal performance at the world cup and subsequent qualification for the Tokyo Olympic Games have provided exemplary roles models for the younger generations.  Hockey as a sport caters equally to both genders and all ages, from 4 years to 80 years plus, as evidenced at a recent masters hockey tournament.  As Mr. Pels said, it is also important to note that the sport of parahockey is continuing to grow and provides, through the club system, the opportunity for individuals with intellectual difficulties to participate and enjoy the camaraderie and health benefits of the sport.  The current public profile of the sport was brought to a crescendo at the Olympic qualifier tournament, held in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook at the start of November this year.  While the success of the women&rsquo;s team in such a nail biting finish was fantastic, the fact that over 12,200 people attended over the two nights of the weekend showed that interest in the sport was at an all-time high.<\/p> <p>  While perceived as expensive, hockey is at its most basic level a relatively inexpensive activity.  In essence, there are only three requirements to get a community up and running to get started in the sport; a playing surface, hockey sticks and balls and a coach with an understanding of the basic skills of the game.  The provision of the equipment has an easy solution that Hockey Ireland and the clubs and provinces can provide if appropriately supported.  The two challenges are the sourcing, training and certification of an adequate number of coaches and volunteers and also finding suitable areas for playing and practising.  It is interesting to note that currently a group of 60 girls practise and play regularly on a GAA pitch in Waterford.  We also have a number of examples of schools and community groups, sometimes in conjunction with their local sports partnerships, LSPs, and hockey clubs, taking up indoor hockey in local halls.  Ireland did in the recent past have quite a number of clubs and players playing indoor hockey.  This is an area that Hockey Ireland sees as a potential opportunity for developing the game and introducing it to new community groups of all ages.  Another creative initiative that started relatively recently is the concept of hockey for mums and hockey for dads.  Innovative clubs decided to provide the opportunity for parents to learn and play hockey, at their level, while waiting for their children to complete their training and practice sessions.  In some instances up to 60 adults availed of the chance to try the sport out and as a result started to get more embedded in the clubs and sport as a whole.  Most parishes across the country have access to an indoor hall that can be easily set up to accommodate hockey, thereby subverting the immediate need for expensive outdoor facilities to be developed.<\/p> <p>  The board of Hockey Ireland recently held a full-day session to finalise the strategic pillars for the sport over the next three to five years.  We were joined that day by representatives from Sport Ireland; the Olympic Federation of Ireland; members of the current senior men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s squads; a representative from our junior age group, JAG, teams; people representing the four provinces; Hockey Ireland staff; and, Hockey Ireland's European Hockey Federation representative.  Participation and development was one of the pillars that everyone agreed was key to our strategic development as a sport.  In fleshing out the pillar we called out the need to expand the geographic footprint of the sport, increase the number of players at all levels and all ages and broaden the number and skills of volunteers who are involved in hockey, be they coaches, umpires or administrators.  The consensus was that the main means that will help us to achieve this are collaboration with other sports organisations, local sports partnerships, schools and colleges and local communities, whereby they will provide the people resources be they players or volunteers and Hockey Ireland and the LSPs will work to provide the expertise and infrastructure to allow things to happen.  As an organisation and community, we believe we have much to contribute to a healthy and inspired Ireland.  We thank the Chairman and committee for their time and for affording us the opportunity to meet with them today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Jacob"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pels and Ms Jacob.

The success is inspiring many people to take up the sport but we have noted some barriers in this regard at grassroots level.  It will take some time to catch-up in terms of training sufficient numbers of our volunteers to provide the coaching to enable that growth.

As we currently do not have a hockey stadium with sufficient capacity to enable it, in co-operation with Leinster Rugby we were able to lay a temporary surface over the existing surface at the Energia Stadium, where the match was played in front of a very large crowd.  This technology was developed by a hockey pitch manufacturer and England Hockey working with people on the base layer and coming together to form the organisation Big Stadium Hockey.

For us, it is always about trying to bridge that gap.<\/p><p>Over the past year and a half, the committee has seen that we are bridging the gap as players.  The funding coming in now since the world cup has been brilliant in allowing us to turn semi-professional in a sense, but challenges are still there for players every day.  They have to go to work or college and are trying to train in a professional environment.  The programme in place for 2020 has allowed us to come together a lot more, but we must sacrifice how we live on a day-to-day basis to do that.  Our need involves making that commitment a bit easier for the players and turning it into a more professional set-up.  The long term should be in sight.  Whatever we will achieve in the next couple of years, it is about the grassroots and the girls coming in behind us so that we do not just have a structure for the next year or the next two years but one that will allow the younger teams to carry on and achieve what we will have achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Would any other member of the team like to say something?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#H00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>What I have to say is similar to what to Ms Daly said.  It has been fantastic for the growth of the sport over the past couple of years.  A traditionally minority sport, hockey has been riding on the crest of a wave.  It is now about taking the opportunity with both hands and being able to develop those structures underneath it so that we can ensure the longevity of the sport and put those structures in place to allow the sport to grow.  The successes, including the number of people taking up the sport around the country, have been great.  As players, it is something in which we take a lot of pride.<\/p> <p>  Inspiring the next generation has been fantastic for us but in the short term, as Ms Daly said, the Olympics represent the pinnacle of our sport.  The world cup was a bonus - a fantastic bonus - but it was always about the Olympics.  Qualifying for the Olympics was another step in the process for us.  We do not want to just turn up for the Olympics to make up the numbers.  We are looking to medal at the Olympics, which is set to be the hottest Olympics on record, so planning and preparing in the next couple of months to play eight games in 14 days will be hugely demanding for us.  We are hoping for anything that can alleviate the external stress for us and allow us to concentrate on the training while we are competing against full-time programmes so that we can bring home another medal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Evans"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I had some conversations with some of them in advance of the meeting.  It is to be hoped they will have continued success.  I do not think they put down that they won team of the year at the sports awards last year as well, which was another achievement.  I thank them for the opening statement.  There are things about the organisation that I had not realised, so it is very useful to get that context.  It would be very useful if the briefing document was included with the report that goes to Sport Ireland and the Minister because I found that very useful.  There would have been some questions that are answered in this so I thank the witnesses for pre-empting the questions in terms of how one breaks down the various provinces.  It is quite useful to benchmark that into the future regarding where the growth is.  It is nice to have that set as a base.<\/p> <p>  The all-Ireland aspect is very interesting.  It would be quite interesting to hear something about that such as how well that works.  Why would Hockey Ireland not get TV revenues if they are available?  Can something be done about this?  That is one of the dominant forms of income in some of the bigger sports where gate receipts are becoming a more diminished aspect of funding.  It would be interesting to see what is possible there and how that might work.<\/p> <p>  The success of the team has been a shop window for others to get involved.  I am not surprised that there was an upsurge after that.  That kind of mainstream coverage of the events is critically important.  It is quite amazing how women's sports tend to be the under-represented sports, but when they are put out there in a shop window, they are equally attractive.  There is a lesson there for people who are programming to make sure they are properly covered.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I wanted to ask about is VAT in sport.  Will the witnesses send us a note about the shortcomings and what could improve that?  Obviously, there is a differentiation between commercial sports played at professional level from which there is an income and the other side of it where people who are playing are trying to hold down jobs and fundraise at the same time.<\/p> <p>  I was really pleased to see attention paid to the governance - the boring governance aspect.  It will remain boring as long as it is done right.  When it is done properly, the focus ends up being on the sport itself and not on issues that are about failures in terms of administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#H00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>Would Ms Duke like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#H00500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I will not comment on the VAT issue because it is certainly not my area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Duke"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I was quite interested in how the all-Ireland aspect functions and whether it functions well and opens up other opportunities.

It is the first Irish team to reach a world cup final.  I watched the final, as most members probably did, or at least the highlights thereof.  It was a significant boost for women and women's sport as well as for hockey.  Women's participation in sport is the overarching theme of this meeting.  Some of the greatest figures in sport in Ireland currently are women.  I refer to Katie Taylor and Kelly Harrington who have reached the top of their sport, as well as Ellen Keane who competes in swimming in the Paralympics.  Without question, women who participate in sport can achieve at the highest level internationally.  The Irish women's cricket team has also performed very well.<\/p> <p>  The issue of television rights and coverage has been raised.  A survey carried out in the past year or two indicates that 12% of sports coverage comprises women's sport.  I was surprised the figure was that high.  Coverage online is between 3% and 4%.  The survey found that 58% of men and 64% thought there should be more coverage of women's sport.  Obviously, far more men than women think there is enough coverage of women's sport.  The standard argument is that if there is audience demand, the coverage will be offered.  It is a case of putting the cart before the horse.  The argument about audience and achievement is rendered meaningless by the US women's soccer team, which is more successful and draws bigger crowds than the US men's soccer team.  As members will be aware, chants demanding equal pay broke out throughout the stadium at the final of the women's soccer world cup.  They are pioneers on equal pay.  Usually, women in sport just look for something a bit better.  For example,the Irish women's soccer team was not looking for equal pay but, rather, for the players to be given tracksuits of their own.  The Irish women's hockey team has definitely added to the empowerment of women in sport.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in Ms Jacob's comment on hockey not being expensive.  I totally agree that one can play hockey without too much expense.  However, there is a class element to hockey relating to the schools in which it is played.  For example, I went to an all-girls school where one could play basketball but not hockey, whereas the boarding school next door offered hockey.  What is the reason for that class element?  Why does it persist?  It should be examined because the more people who play a sport, the better it will be.  I do not blame anyone involved in hockey for the class element but, rather, point out that we should examine it because there would be a higher participation rate if it was offered more widely.  Similarly, it is not expensive to study ballet.  It is less expensive to take ballet lessons than Irish dancing lessons but there is a certain elitism that persists in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  I again congratulate the team on its achievement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#J00400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I play for a club based in Tallaght, which is not a highly recognised hockey catchment area.

Watching the team's sheer joy in its celebrations on the pitch afterwards brought a smile to the nation.

There are approximately 64 all-Ireland sports teams and associations.  My view is that no one should be required to have a particular passport when playing in Ireland.  It is a requirement in cricket.  It is not a requirement of Cricket Ireland but of the European Cricket Council.  A player must have a passport of the country for whom he is playing.  Obviously, given our unique circumstances, I do not believe that should be a requirement in Ireland.  Again, that may be an argument this committee could make on behalf of hockey players.  Identity is a major issue and we do not want it to be an issue for someone playing for the team.<\/p><p> The Minister is coming before the committee next week.  Thankfully, it is not because of the hockey players or their association.  Is there something Hockey Ireland would like us to say to the Minister?  He made an announcement of &euro;1 million.  That was somewhat overstating the case.  What share of that has Hockey Ireland seen?  What share does the association require?  Having done quite a public relations job for himself on that occasion, the Minister deserves to have to deliver on his fine words and promise.  Is the cheque still in the post?  What cheque should we be asking him for next week?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#K01800","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>The question of pension contributions may be technical but it is true of course that elite athletes basically postpone their career to a significant extent and therefore regular employment income.  That would be a good point to look into.<\/p> <p>  The question of passports is interesting.  I need to say this right.  The passport question is important because of the rules that govern international representative teams.  The rules are in place to protect us because otherwise many countries would basically shop for talent.  The passport rule in the world of sport is recognised as being a good rule.  Even internationally and at International Olympic Committee level there are rules and stipulations to the effect that a person cannot change passport at the drop of a hat.  There is a four-year waiting time.  That is to ensure people do not simply go to the country that pays the most or offers other benefits.  In that sense the rule helps.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be clear: to play hockey at national level - to play for a club - there is no requirement for passports, so there is no concern about that.  In fact, that is a regular occurrence in our sport.  We have Irish players who play in Europe at club level.  They are playing for different clubs in national competitions.  In theory, a person of any nationality could play for clubs in Ireland as well.  When a player represents a country, the passport becomes an issue or is subject to the rule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Pels"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>It comes from the International Hockey Federation.

Much has been said already and I do not intend to repeat any questions.  I want to pick up on some points made in the opening statement and flesh them out.<\/p> <p>  The first point arises from an infrastructural point of view.  How many employees does Hockey Ireland have?  What is the aspiration when it comes to development officers?  People have talked about broadening the sport in places like Connacht or in the wider society.  However, we have seen from other sports the importance of development officers and co-ordinating with physical education teachers who want to bring in the sport and work with local sports partnerships.  What is the strategy for rolling out, as Dublin GAA did for hurling and camogie ten or 20 years ago?  How can that be replicated?<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe touched on infrastructure and pitch access.  It is great to hear about the new clubs in Tipperary working with facilities in Waterford but hockey pitches are expensive.  I am not only talking about the national stadium, UCD or the temporary pitch that was so brilliantly used by the Irish hockey team in Energia Park.  I have in mind the standard pitch that will run through the day as well.  My constituency is something of a hotbed for hockey.  Two clubs have a waiting list for every girls team from junior infants up to under-16 level.  That is simply because there is insufficient pitch time.  I have spoken to people playing hockey in Australia.  They say they have training sessions at 11 p.m. or midnight.  That may be because it is 40oC during the day but it is a matter of being inventive, as well as being cognisant of planning conditions that only allow floodlights to be on until 10 p.m.<\/p> <p>  The final point has been brushed on briefly by everyone.  It relates specifically to the current players and concern about player welfare.  It is not a professional sport.  How does a player balance becoming an Olympian and playing at elite level with a day job or college?  What is involved in the average day?  What support do the players get from Hockey Ireland?  What if the employer is not sympathetic?  What about family members?  The Hockey Ireland representatives referred to the goal for the hockey league and television rights or aspirations to be online.  Many players have been playing abroad recently, including those on the Irish team.  They have played on the Continent or under collegiate system in the USA.  I assume the aspiration, like other sports, is to have every Irish international playing in Ireland around the clock.  How can that be achieved?  What is afoot to try to achieve that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#L00700","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":613,"content":"<p>At the moment the number of employees we have is at 17 or 18.

I played abroad for one year and Ms Nicola Daly played abroad for two years.  In college, balancing life and hockey is okay but once players come into the real world it is certainly more difficult and they become more aware of how their peers are progressing at a different level in their career.  Following the success in the World Cup and with help from Park Developments, SoftCo and Sport Ireland, we have been able to become a bit more semi-professional since July.  That has been a major driver in getting players to return home.  Five of us were playing abroad last year and we are all back in Ireland now playing on a semi-professional basis.<\/p> <p>  Regarding balancing with work, I have recently started working in a job two days a week.  The coverage we have got over the past two years has made companies and employers buy into our story and they allow us a bit more flexibility.  Although we are incredibly grateful for all the support, we still need to work for a couple of days a week in order to get by.  There are challenges to it but we do not really think about it as a sacrifice as such; it is our choice.  We want to play for our country and we also want to progress in our career.<\/p> <p>  It is a little daunting.  While Ms Lisa Jacob is a little older than I am, we are all coming to the end of our careers in the next four-year cycle.

I will give an example.  Considerable money was put into laying 4G and 5G pitches.  If a 3G pitch is put down, it is suddenly available to hockey.  An awful lot of money is put into these pitches that might cost &euro;180,000 or whatever when a little extra money might allow more sports to use these pitches.<\/p> <p>  I make this request of the committee.

Is that something the women's hockey players are coming across?  It is not just because an existing sporting organisation has facilities which seem to be empty.  Some organisations are not making them available to women, which shows the inequality women are facing in sports.  There is no requirement on organisations that are given money.  We got around the London Irish one by saying that because we got lottery funding we would have to allow them on the pitch as long as they did not bring a ball and suddenly a ball appeared.

I previously dealt with senior management in the Coast Guard about the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island and a previous draft report, referred to as the Feron report, which contained scathing criticism of senior management in the Irish Coast Guard service was uncovered by the community group in Valentia.  That report went to senior management in the Coast Guard and all of the criticism of senior management was taken out of the report.  The final report that went to the relevant Minister at the time, Deputy Varadkar, contained no criticism of senior management.  It should be borne in mind that this was years ago.  That was a second attempt to close the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island by giving false information to a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, in the first instance, and, subsequently, to a Fine Gael Minister.<\/p> <p>  There are issues relating to Rescue 116, including the faulty information that it had, rosters and so on in the information we have available to us.  I have information about life jackets and have asked for the correspondence without, and within, the Department.  My information is that the Coast Guard was aware those jackets were faulty when Coast Guard volunteer, Caitriona Lucas, died in Clare.  Senior management was aware that those life jackets were not deploying on impact with water.  While that may not have been the reason that lady passed away, the life jacket did not deploy.  There are allegations that jackets were changed and the life jacket Ms Lucas was supposed to be wearing was not the one she was wearing.  I take all of that with a pinch of salt but, on top of that, there were questions about the procurement of lifeboats of questionable origin and over the use of cars and jeeps.<\/p> <p>  The Feron report, although not an official report, said senior management was critically flawed.  Everything that has happened since should be considered in the light of that draft report stating how bad senior management in the Coast Guard was.  That report dates back to 2007.  Looking at everything that has happened since, the original report was correct and the senior management in the Coast Guard is costing lives, as we saw with the tragedy of Rescue 116 and the life jacket of Caitriona Lucas.  I have asked for the correspondence because my information is that there was a lot of stuff going on about the procurement of equipment by senior management who were also at the back end of the companies that were supplying that equipment.  That is secondary to the fact that people are losing their lives.<\/p> <p>  When the report into Rescue 116 is available, the whole senior management of the Coast Guard and the Secretary General or assistant secretary should be brought before the committee and asked about those life jackets.  We also want to know about the procurement process for the life jackets because concerns were raised prior to their purchase.  I want to put to those representatives that there was a reason they purchased those life jackets and we should be concerned about that, even though they are only allegations.

The Committee of Public Accounts is also examining that matter but, given it concerns the RSA, it also falls under the remit of this committee.  I did not realise the RSA has &euro;25 million in the bank.  That is a serious amount.  It has &euro;25 million in the bank while charging &euro;72 million per year to people who are trying to export goods out of the country.  The authority does not need all that money.<\/p> <p>  Hauliers have stated that the RSA is looking to consolidate power.  This is why I asked for the regulatory impact assessment.  This also affects the Chairman's constituency.  The current testing system for hauliers means that if a haulier wants to bring a truck for testing, he or she can ring a local CVRT person with whom they have a relationship.  The tester is not going to pass the vehicle because he or she knows the haulier, but the haulier can drop the truck in at 11 o'clock at night when it is back from its journey.  That might shift to an amalgamated system because the RSA wants to put it out for tender and have one body to do it all, as is the case for car testing.  When the road hauliers asked senior management of the RSA if they would be allowed to take the trailer on the truck to a tester at 11 p.m. or 6 a.m., they were told they would not.  If there is a flaw with a truck, for example a brake pad is required on one wheel, hauliers are currently allowed by the operators of test centres to bring in their own mechanic and fix it on site.  That would no longer be the case.<\/p><p>They would have to go to the cost of bringing in a truck to haul it away, which is hundreds of euro.  That is why I asked that, before the RSA goes off and puts this out to public tender for one system, while we are all in pre-election mode and when we might put something in front of a Minister and say \"sign that\", we should ask it not to do any of that until it gives us a regulatory impact assessment on the impact on the average road haulier of its proposed system.<\/p><p> Another point, which is way more serious is that, based on information the RSA gave to Deputy Robert Troy, the level of testing it does on foreign registered trucks is minuscule - by its own admission, it is 5% to 8% - whereas the estimated proportion of foreign registered trucks, although the RSA does not know it exactly, is about 30%, or possibly higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#P01800","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":696,"content":"<p>The Senator is raising serious issues.

If it is in order, given Senator Daly has had a fair run and nobody is fighting with him over this, I propose that we ask the RSA management not just to send on the regulatory impact statement but to come to the committee to discuss it.
