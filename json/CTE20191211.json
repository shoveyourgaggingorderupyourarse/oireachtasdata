The challenges of climate change and the global effort that is required to meet those challenges will require significant action across the whole of society.  The recently published climate action plan provides a whole-of-government approach to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions and provides a range of actions for all areas of our economy, which includes the agriculture and the forest land use sectors.  We know the mitigation potential from agriculture is limited but the ag-climatise strategy in the Department, which is currently out for consultation, sets out an ambitious strategy for our agriculture and land use sectors.  The Government's climate action plan sets out ambitious targets for forestry, which can be broadly summarised into the following three main pillars: maintaining the existing forests through sustainable forest management; expanding the forest area through afforestation and; promoting and increasing the use of harvested wood products, including the use of energy derived from sustainably produced forest biomass.<\/p> <p>  The existing forest estate has grown steadily over the past 100 years to just over 770,000 ha today.  The national forest area is 11% and is at its highest level for over 350 years.<\/p><p>This expansion is testament to the significant efforts made by generations of foresters and landowners who have built a forest resource that is providing multiple benefits to society.<\/p><p> Successive Governments have provided significant financial supports in the creation of the public State forests but also in the creation of the private forests owned by more than 22,000 forest owners.  Some 350,000 ha have been planted since 1990.  In 2018 more than 3.69 million cu. m of timber was harvested from Ireland&rsquo;s forests with more than 1 million cu. m coming from private forests.  However, it is important that we continue to manage these forests sustainably to ensure that they continue to provide a range multiple benefits, including carbon sequestration.  Based on the national inventory report, Irish forests remove more than 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.  In addition, the carbon stored in harvested wood products, amounting to an additional 0.73 million tonnes, demonstrates the importance of increasing the use of timber across the whole of society.  The climate action plan also acknowledges that we must continue to protect and monitor our forests for disease, fires and deforestation which can also be a source of emissions.<\/p><p> The second key pillar of the climate action plan is to continue the efforts to increase the size of the national forest area through increased afforestation.  The climate action plan has set an ambitious target of achieving 8,000 ha per year and this will present many challenges but also opportunities for landowners who wish to plant.  The performance of meeting our afforestation targets under our current national forestry programme has fallen behind in recent years for a variety of reasons, including land availability and increasing land prices.  However, this trend must be reversed.<\/p><p> We have made significant changes to our forestry programme as part of the mid-term review and we are seeing some progress in certain areas but more needs to be done.  We must also work harder to communicate to the wider public the importance of forestry and ensure that the forests created reflect good practice in forest design.  We must continue to support species diversity and ensure that forests have a positive impact on the environment.  The recent changes made to the existing forestry programme are having positive impacts in increasing the percentage of broadleaves planted which amounted to more than 27% of the species mix in forests planted in 2018.  We must also continue to support and encourage forest owners in the management of their plantations and encourage a diversity of species and sustainable management practices.  I am encouraged to see the increased take up in the use of continuous cover forestry and agroforestry, although small-scale, these certainly have an increasing role to play as an alternative management practice in certain locations.  Species selection and tree breeding can also play a significant role in ensuring that existing and future forests are resilient and can adapt in a changing climate.<\/p><p> It is clear there is no silver bullet to achieving higher planting rates and that a multifaceted strategy must be employed.  This means putting in more efforts to get farmers to re-engage with the programme and better communication of the farm-forestry message.  It means better integration between the next Common Agricultural Policy and the next national forestry programme.  It also means better use of suitable public lands for afforestation and we have already seen some significant announcements here through collaboration between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na, for example.  We also need to share knowledge and build and manage more resilient forests for the future and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working closely with stakeholders and the COFORD Council through various working groups.<\/p><p> The forecasted increase in volumes from the forest estate is set to double to nearly 8 million cu. m by 2035, and it is important that we continue to mobilise this timber to all available markets.  The climate action plan contains a number of actions which will continue the good work already taking place in areas of research and innovation.<\/p><p> Forestry is a climate change solution and combined with emission reductions across all sectors, we will continue our efforts to meet our climate change commitments.  I look forward to discussing with the committee the role forests plays in climate change and to hear members' views on how we can maximise the contribution that forests will make now and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hayes.

I joined Coillte as CEO just over one month ago and it is already very clear to me that responding to climate change will be one of the defining challenges of my leadership of this organisation and, for this reason, I welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee at this early stage of my tenure.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 Citizens' Assembly recognised the important role forestry has to play in tackling climate change in Ireland.  Last April this committee published its report, and in June the Minister, Deputy Bruton, published the Government&rsquo;s first climate action plan.  Each of these valuable initiatives have highlighted the same core message, which is that forestry is a key enabler in Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate change and I believe that there is a serious responsibility on all of us to respond positively to these clear calls to action.<\/p> <p>  What strikes me about the debate on the role of forestry in supporting climate action is that almost everybody agrees that we need to plant more trees and that we need to manage our existing forests responsibly.  However, there are differing views on forestry practices and systems and on the direction of forest policy.  I am very happy to be here with my colleagues today to listen to those views and to offer insights and perspectives from an organisation that has spent 30 years managing forests on behalf of the State.  <\/p> <p>  Coillte is custodian of approximately 7% of our total land area, so we clearly have a vital role to play.  We do not have all the answers but what we have within our organisation is a deep well of forestry knowledge and expertise and, as the largest manager of woodlands in the State, we are acutely aware of the threat posed by climate change and our role in helping society meet this challenge.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s forests represent our largest carbon sink and store.  They also offer solutions to many of the other challenges our society faces.  Our forests support a vibrant forest products sector which employs 12,000 people in rural areas.  They provide sustainable building materials to replace carbon heavy products such as steel and concrete.  They can also improve our biodiversity, clean our water, reduce the risk of flooding, and provide great places for people to get active outdoors and experience nature.  On this last point, Coillte&rsquo;s forests are entirely open access and we have an estimated 18 million visits to our forests each year.  We already have over 3,000 km of hiking trails, 12 forest parks and nearly 300 recreation areas.  Looking forward, we will continue to enhance our outdoor forest recreation offering.<\/p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s forestry is very young in international terms.  When the State was formed nearly 100 years ago our country had almost no forest cover, but as a result of significant public investment over the second half of the last century, it has increased to approximately 11%.  However, despite this expansion, we still have one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe.  That said, Ireland has exceptionally good conditions for growing trees.  Our soils and our mild, wet climate mean that some tree species grow faster on this island than anywhere else in Europe.<\/p> <p>  As a country, we have an opportunity to increase our level of forest cover and realise all the benefits that forestry has to offer.  However, to achieve this we need a vision for the future of forestry that enjoys broad public support.  Forestry is a long-term commitment and decisions taken today have consequences far into the future.  We therefore need to focus on identifying a vision for forestry that responds to the challenges we face in the century ahead.  In my view the vision of the future of forestry can, and should, be inspiring and appealing, but it also needs to be realisable and sustainable.  This is where balancing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of forestry is crucial.<\/p> <p>  In this context it is important that we recognise that managed forests are highly efficient at sequestering carbon.  As forests grow and mature the rate at which they sequester new carbon eventually begins to decline.  The advantage of an actively managed forest is that when trees mature, they are removed and replaced by new young trees, which are more effective at absorbing new carbon, thus starting the cycle again.<\/p> <p>  Actively managed plantation forests have a really important role to play in tackling climate change.  This is due to their triple benefit whereby in the first instance trees sequester carbon as the tree grows.  This carbon is then locked away in timber products when the mature tree is harvested thereby providing a second benefit.  Timber products substitute other carbon heavy products like concrete or steel.<\/p> <p>  As the transition to a low carbon economy begins to take hold, we are already seeing innovative new applications of wood fibre and it is likely this trend will accelerate as the circular economy and the bioeconomy scale up and become mainstream.  In continental Europe, we are already seeing engineered timber construction being deployed in high-rise structures and wood-based products being developed to replace plastics and synthetic textiles.<\/p><p>At Coillte, we are committed to building on the momentum we have achieved in recent years to contribute further to Ireland's approach to forestry, climate change and the use of our natural resources for the greater good of Irish citizens.  The challenge, as we see it, is to continue to get the balance right between the commercial, environmental and social or recreational dividend from forests in the ever-evolving world in which we operate.  We are always looking to strike the right balance and for us, it is about planting the right tree in the right place with the right objective.<\/p><p> Today, we manage one fifth of our estate primarily for biodiversity purposes.  In order to underpin how we are responding to changing societal demands, we recently established a new non-profit entity, Coillte Nature, which will focus exclusively on increasing the delivery of non-commercial woodlands, undertaking major biodiversity projects and large-scale forest conversion projects.  Forestry has never been more relevant than it is today.  Our objective is to work collaboratively with the Government, the Oireachtas, this committee, our customers and the public to ensure we optimise the contribution Coillte can make in the years ahead.  My colleagues and I look forward to elaborating further on the points made in this short opening statement and to answering any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Imelda Hurley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hurley.

My statement will cover the social impacts of forestry.  I am joined today by Dr. Eugene Hendrick, who will take any additional specific questions on forests and climate change.<\/p> <p>  As stated in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's forestry programme, one of the aims of the current afforestation programme is to increase forest cover so as to \"capture carbon, produce wood and help mitigation\".  This programme will require a significant number of landowners to change land use by undertaking afforestation.  Such a change will have both climate impacts and social impacts.  Let us look at what are the social impacts of forestry.  In its narrowest sense, the social impact of forestry can be measured in terms of employment generation.  Based on research carried out by me and a number of colleagues, we estimated that the total employment, direct and indirect, associated with forestry is 5,531 full-time jobs, while estimates for total employment in the wood products sector is 6,408 full-time jobs.  This research dates back to 2012 and I am involved in new research to get more up-to-date estimates of current employment in the two sectors.  Employees in the forestry and wood processing sectors are, in the main, rural based and a recent study suggests that a significant proportion of these are part-time farmers.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, the understanding of what is meant by social impacts has broadened to include impacts on quality of life.  Forests may generate social values or be connected with people's lives in ways that contribute or deduct from social well-being.  For example, forests provide opportunities for recreation and amenity.  Based on published research, estimates of visitation rates to Irish forests vary from 18 million visits per annum to 29 million visits per annum.  Recreation in Ireland generally occurs in the public forest estate as there is no right of access to private forests.  Other quality-of-life impacts are generally assessed by investigating how local stakeholders perceive forestry as a part of their social and physical environment.  In Ireland, a number of social impact studies of forestry have been undertaken.  These have focused on case studies in the north west, east and south west of Ireland and have employed structured interviews with stakeholders.  The findings from this research indicate that the reaction to afforestation and attitudes generally to forestry are context-specific.  Where planted forests have been a feature of the landscape for a long period, more positive attitudes to forestry and afforestation have been recorded.  Among the factors that influence reactions to afforestation is the question of who is doing it, whether it is local people or outsiders.  If it is the latter, it can lead to a sense that afforestation is replacing people, thereby threatening cultural identity.  Even if local people, typically farmers, are the ones engaging in afforestation, there can be a concern that if trees replace agricultural activity this will in turn replace people.<\/p> <p>  The evidence to date is that the majority of the 22,955 owners of forests planted since 1980 are farmers.  The statistics suggest that these have chosen to afforest only a portion of their farm, as the average size of afforestation parcel is 8.7 ha.  Typically, afforestation has been carried out on the poorest parts of farms.  The income from the forestry premium contributes to farm income and enables those who wish to do so to remain in farming.  In 2017, of the &euro;72 million paid in forestry premiums, &euro;67.5 million or 94%, was paid to farmers.<\/p> <p>  Social impact studies have consistently highlighted the often dramatic effect of large blocks of forest, in particular conifer forests, on the landscape.  As trees grow, they heighten the sense of social isolation that prevails in many rural areas.  Afforestation has often coincided with social changes, such as a decline in the agricultural labour force, ageing of the agricultural population, and population migration to urban areas.  For some, forests are the manifestation of this rural transformation.  Afforestation often also challenges long-held beliefs as to the appropriate use of agricultural land.<\/p> <p>  At a broader scale, public attitudes to forestry in Ireland have been gauged in a number of large studies.  In the most recent study, the majority, that is, 88% of the almost 1,000 people surveyed, agreed that forests were an important part of the traditional landscape of the Irish countryside and agreed that all types of forest are good for the environment.  Nevertheless, the study showed a strong preference for mixed forests and broadleaf forests over conifer forests.  It also showed, as have similar studies across Europe, that the forest outputs that the public rank as the most important tend to be the ecological ones such as the conservation of plants and animals rather than the timber production and employment outputs.  I look forward to taking questions on my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in.

We look forward to dealing with questions from members afterwards.  Pro Silva Ireland is an all-Ireland organisation supporting the use of alternative forest management systems to the clear-fell system.  These alternative systems are generally called continuous cover forestry, CCF, and these systems do not clear-fell the forest but instead involve thinning trees periodically while allowing the retained forest to grow and develop.  Pro Silva Ireland is part of a wider European network of Pro Silva organisations across 27 countries.  We have a diverse and dynamic membership of foresters, forest owners, contractors, ecologists, wood scientists, artists and others.<\/p> <p>  Well-managed forests can provide many functions.  They can produce timber for domestic and industrial use, be places of recreation while enhancing our landscape, protect and clean our water while helping prevent flooding, stabilise and improve our soils, harbour and enrich biodiversity, sequester carbon, shelter our farms and be places of inspiration, wonder and calm.<\/p> <p>  Successive forestry programmes and forestry practice in Ireland has concentrated on the timber-production function.  This has resulted in the successful establishment of a vibrant timber processing sector and in vital job creation in rural communities.  The clear-fell system has been used in efficiently producing timber to feed this industry.  However, this management system struggles to satisfactorily deliver the other services that society requires from forests and this is at the heart of recent protests against forestry in Leitrim, for example.  It is clear that society wants more from Irish forests in the form of the aforementioned multiple benefits.  That has been recognised in the forestry sector and many positive initiatives have developed over the past 20 years in that regard.  In Pro Silva Ireland we believe that CCF will deliver these multiple benefits in a sustainable way that will rebuild a forest culture, be profitable and at the same time deliver a range of environmental services.  We know from the experience of CCF forests managed in Ireland, and more so from those under longer-term CCF management in Europe, that it is possible to sustain commercial timber production while delivering the multiple benefits.  This committee's role is to consider action on climate change and what measures can be adopted to mitigate this hugely serious issue.  Well-managed forests are excellent carbon sinks and we are paying the price both globally and nationally for both current and historic deforestation.<\/p><p>How we manage our forests also has a significant effect on the efficiency of carbon sequestration.  CCF is an efficient means of optimising carbon storage in forests as it avoids the large-scale release of soil carbon that occurs when plantations are clear-felled, given that more than 70% of forest carbon is held in the forest soil.  It produces a higher percentage of high-quality and long-life timber products, in which sequestered carbon is locked for a longer timeframe.  Moreover, it increases forest biodiversity in general and provides permanent forest habitats that keep carbon locked in the forest and results in more resilient forests, with lower biotic and abiotic risks.<\/p><p> Planting new forests has been widely recognised as a way in which society can take positive climate action.  We must, however, maintain a focus on delivering the multiple benefits of forestry, rather than just one function, whether timber production or carbon sequestration.  The question of monocultures inevitably arises in this regard.  Pro Silva Ireland is deeply concerned with the continued predominance of monocultures in Irish forestry.  Even aged monocultural crops are incapable of delivering the wider long-term social and environmental benefits of forestry.  There is also considerable concern about their resilience in the face of climate change.  The very forests planted to mitigate climate change could become casualties of it.  Concerns about the sustainability of monocultures are not new and at present in central Europe, bark beetles devastate large areas of monocultural spruce plantations, which suffer drought stress directly related to climate change.  In Ireland, we have our own problems, with ash dieback disease devastating monocultural ash plantations.  <\/p><p> To date, most policy initiatives to encourage or require greater levels of diverse planting have ended up compartmentalising different species into small monocultures.  We believe that new planting must be robustly mixed with greater utilization of native species and that we should cease planting monocultures.  It is important that expectations be managed in respect of what is possible from CCF.  Forests, by their nature, take time to plan, develop, grow and transform.  Similarly, if we want to achieve a cultural change in Irish forestry, this will also take time and investment.  No magic wand can be waved to transform Irish forests overnight.  It will take long-term planning, with a refocusing of forest policy and programmes.  There are significant challenges in the form of training and capacity building within the forestry sector, transforming existing monocultures into more diverse forests, maintaining commercial timber production and associated jobs through the necessary changes, the reliance on private landowners and private forestry businesses to deliver new forests, educating wider society of the multiple benefits of forestry, managing invasive and unsustainable deer populations, as well as restructuring inappropriately located and designed forests.<\/p><p> Tackling climate change and specifically reducing our carbon and greenhouse gas emissions is a multifaceted problem and no single policy, such as planting more forests, will solve it.  Nevertheless, well-designed, well-managed and resilient forests can play their part in tackling this great problem of our time while at the same time doing much more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Purser","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Purser and invite Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it and to discuss the contribution that forestry and timber make to combating climate change.  Forest Industries Ireland, FII, is only one year old.  We want to increase knowledge and awareness about forestry and timber.  We would love to better inform our fellow citizens about the industry, its prospects and challenges and its contributions to climate change.<\/p> <p>  I am the chief executive of Balcas Limited.  We have two factories, in Enniskillen and Invergordon in Scotland.  We process 1 million cu. m of sustainable forest output annually, from which we produce a range of wood products for construction, fencing and packaging.  We generate all our own electricity and spill the same amount to the grid, which is enough electricity for all the homes in County Fermanagh.  We also make wood pellets, and our heat fuel from the forests of Ireland and Scotland annually displaces 100 million l of oil from Ireland and Britain.  We have no wood fibre waste.<\/p> <p>  I am also the chairman of FII, an all-island body constituted within IBEC.  Our member companies cover the whole supply chain.  There are nurseries that grow saplings, forestry consultants who work with farmers and landowners to plant and manage their forests and factories that convert the forest crop into construction timber, panel products, fencing materials, packaging and biofuel.  For many decades, the State and our people have invested in increasing afforestation in Ireland.  In return, our island now has an industry that provides 12,000 jobs throughout our rural communities.  The economic contribution is approximately &euro;2.3 billion per annum.  Over the coming years, the private forests planted in the 1980s and 1990s will come to maturity and will deliver a major supply increase onto the market, which is a further opportunity for Ireland.  Today, we work with more than 20,000 farmer-forest owners, most of whom have planted a portion of their land.  They receive a steady and reliable income and it delivers a valuable crop when the forest matures.  Farmers are invariably interested in the environmental contribution their forests make.<\/p> <p>  Ireland's forests produce timber at three times the rate of Scandinavia's and are a major carbon sink.  Forestry in Ireland is already a large part of this island&rsquo;s fight against climate change.  Irish forests capture 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 yearly, while the total carbon store is more than 300 million tonnes.  This is testament to the policies of successive Governments to plant trees and create and support a vibrant forest sector.  Throughout the world, forests have been identified as the most scalable opportunity to absorb CO2.  In Ireland, we have learned a great deal.  We are increasing diversity and balance, are providing more leisure and recreational opportunities for our citizens and are increasing the provision of one of nature&rsquo;s great renewable raw materials.  <\/p> <p>  We should increasingly seek to use our own timber as a mass-market construction material.  Wood can displace cement and steel in our built environment and is doing so today throughout the world.  The world&rsquo;s tallest timber building was completed in Norway this year, with 18 storeys of apartments.  Wood is used to remodel, expand and extend the life of existing structures, maintaining the existing foundations.  In Ireland, too, we should embrace the greater use of timber, which will require changes to our building regulations.  The Government can take a lead by enabling the construction of more timber housing, and procuring new greener schools and civic buildings that use cross-laminated timber as the backbone of their structure.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to climate action are already supported by our growing forests.  To continue this into the future, we must plant more and continue to improve forest management.  We have done well to climb back from less than 1% forest cover 100 years ago to the 11% of today.  Now is the time to redouble our efforts and build a coalition of farmers, foresters and policymakers to drive continued forest development.<\/p> <p>  Farmers are the foundation of future policy, and industry and the Government must rise to the challenge of rewarding them.  The climate action plan produced by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has an annual target of 8,000 ha of new afforestation.  We need to support our farmers and rural communities.  We want them to feel encouraged to see forestry as a positive option on their farms, both for the sake of the environment and for a reliable family income.  We all want to find ways to diversify the forest estate.  Already, approximately 30% of the trees being planted are broadleaf.  We want to increase the creation of native woodland and can do so in a way that will go hand in hand with the creation of conifer forests and will sustain the economic value they contribute.  Currently, the greatest driver of broadleaf planting in Ireland is the planting of Sitka spruce.<\/p> <p>  Our sector calls for a renewed vision for forestry in Ireland, based on economic development, climate change goals, biodiversity and social values.  We need all the stakeholders to come together and agree the way forward, rather than have different groups pulling in different directions.  Forestry and timber can make a great positive impact on climate change.  If we get it right, it will work for everyone and for once, the economic and environmental stories will work hand in hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>We will start with the Fianna F&aacute;il group, which has 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#F00100","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank all our guests for their contributions.

Hedgerows were mentioned in the plan as something that should be explored in more detail.  They are a sink since they sequester carbon.  They do not have an accounting value <i>per se<\/i>under the international climate change agreement as I understand it but there is a commitment that the Department and local authorities should do a more detailed assessment of the density of hedgerows within their confines.  There was previously a study by the EPA, with some input from Teagasc and the Department, which examined this issue.  We are a significant funder of hedgerows under our GLAS scheme.  We fund the creation of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 km of new hedgerows and that scheme is ongoing.  In the past three successive agri-environment schemes that we have run, we have funded the creation of approximately 6,000 km of new hedgerows.  The challenge is to find a mechanism for how the sequestration ability of hedgerows can be better factored into climate change policy.  It is a key recommendation that was taken up in the climate action plan from this committee and needs to be looked at in more detail.<br\/><br\/>The second question was about the Forestry Act, which established Coillte.  I am not sure whether that was taken up in the climate action plan as a result of this committee's report.  We are not actively looking at it right now.  Our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are the shareholders in Coillte, so we have ongoing engagement with it.  We have a shareholder letter of expectation every year, which outlines what we expect to see Coillte do each year.  It reports to our Ministers for consent for any activities.<br\/><br\/>The final matter related to broadleaves.  I am glad this has been raised, with different speakers mentioning it in different ways.  In my opening remarks, I mentioned the mid-term review of the forestry programme, which was about reorientating the programme and moving it towards a greater penetration of broadleaves.  We looked at a number of ways of doing that.  We gave a commitment to try to reach a target of 30% broadleaves as part of the national programme.  We recognised that that was not being met mid-way through the current forestry programme.  It was at approximately 21%.  We did a couple of things as part of the mid-term review.  We made it mandatory for the percentage of broadleaves in every plantation to be increased from 10% to 15%.  No forestry site is being planted in the country without a minimum of 15% broadleaf plantation.  We put in place some key enhancements, so any additional investment that we put into the mid-term review was directed primarily at broadleaves.  We had a 7% increase for all broadleaf and diverse conifer grant categories.  We had a 5% increase in the premium category, so if the farmer wants to plant, he will get 5% more than he would previously.  We have had different initiatives since then which were outlined.  One was the woodland environment fund, a partnership between corporate Ireland, businesses, farmers and the Department.  It has taken off recently.  A couple of high-profile companies were investing in that recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The EPA released a new study on Monday, which highlighted deteriorating river quality.

I cannot speak for Teagasc so the question about its resources is best directed to it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle's, statements, this is a key issue, which is delaying the release of licences.  We are the planning authority for forestry and, therefore, we have to make any licence consistent with all of the relevant legislation, which is mainly EU legislation as it is applied and interpreted here.  Case law means that that legislation gets amended and updated.  We are no different from any other public body and have to respond to that.  That includes the environmental impact assessment directive and the habitats and birds directives.<\/p> <p>  We are going through a challenging process to essentially reboot our planning process for the appropriate assessment procedures that are required for the issuing of forestry licences.  We are putting a lot of investment into this because it is not just a matter of updating the procedures but it is about updating protocols and investing in our own staff in order that they are skilled enough to interpret the legislation and issue the resulting licences.  It is also about engaging with the sector so that it understands the changes required and can adapt.  We are very public in saying, as is the Minister of State that we expect to see a better quality of application coming in.  We are ready to work with the sector on that.  A key part of the response is the answer to the Deputy's first question, on the recruitment of additional ecologists.  I have been working in forestry in the Department for two years.  I have seen substantial environmental regulation in that period, and it has happened over previous years as well.  It is a constant challenge for any public body to keep up with that, but that is the issue that the Minister of State referred to.  We continue to issue licences all the time.  The tap is on but it is not flowing to the extent that anybody would like.

It should not be a surprise to the Department or the Government that we should have been making progress in setting the appropriate standards for afforestation.  It has been known for a considerable period that it has a positive impact on carbon sequestration.  Mr. Hayes has answered that but we need action.  It is damaging in a number of ways.  It is damaging for farmers who have got to a point where they are ready to plant, which he will be aware is challenging.  They see it as placing their land outside their control for the rest of their lives, which is a big move for them.  One can get farmers or others to do it and then they are seen to be blocked by the State, which is asking for it to be done on the other hand.  I understand the reasons behind it but we need to be more proactive in going out to farmers, otherwise it turns off a swathe of people who say that they will not bother going through the entire process and spend the money, when it then may not happen.  It also damages the industry and efforts to keep people involved in planting in jobs.  They do not see the commitments or a future in it.  Mr. Hayes has covered this but I wanted to make those comments.<\/p> <p>  Coillte has done a lot of good work over the years but over the past ten years, it started looking at its asset base.  When it started to worry about selling off certain plots of land for building or getting into wind energy, that was all great because it is a semi-State company, but the company lost its focus to some extent.<\/p><p>The company looked at replanting rather than having an ethos of identifying more parcels of land and aggressively and broadening its footprint.

There are enablers that, ultimately, are somewhat challenging for Coillte in that regard.  One is that we do not have access to grants and premia that are available to the private sector.  As a result, when land becomes available there is competition for that land and it is question of financial wherewithal.<\/p> <p>  Second, the availability of land and finding land to plant is an issue in the first place.

There is a lot of interest now in a different approach to farm forestry because it means the farm, the forest and the two not integrated.  There is a lot of interest now and research beginning to ramp up into having these two together.  It might be better referred to as agroforestry or silver pasture systems where the farmer can continue to farm.  I am well aware that farmers want to be farmers and produce food.  If that was possible along with planting trees, albeit less densely, that might be something farmers might find more acceptable but we do not have enough examples of that yet.

I have rarely heard, when the benefits of forestry are being communicated, that forestry is the second most profitable agricultural enterprise after dairying.

There is no doubt that the key driver of forestry in the future will be those people who are under pressure at the moment in their current enterprises.  There has been a great deal of discussion, this year in particular, about the challenges facing the beef sector.

The Deputy mentioned biotic and abiotic risks.  Abiotic risks include elements like wind and fire.  We know the risks for even-aged forests and monocultural forests are higher with wind damage, particularly in cases of poor management, including if they are thinned late, for example.  Fire is an increasing risk with climate change as we are getting drier summers.  We are also getting increased wind storm events because of climate change.<\/p> <p>  In my presentation I outlined the concern that we may drive to plant many new forests, which is a fantastic objective that we should all aspire to, but if they are not made resilient they could become casualties of climate change themselves.  The design and management of those forests is really important.  On the biotic front, I referred to the bark beetle infestation in central Europe, which again has come as a result of very hot and dry summers.  The spruce bark beetle affects monocultures in particular in central Europe and it attacks stressed trees.  When trees and forests come under stress, they are much more prone to the infestation and it has had a knock-on effect here.  As the forest industries know, it has affected timber prices because there is a flood of timber on the market in Europe as those forests had to be felled in an unplanned way.  That has depressed the price of timber.  The cheap timber is going to England now, and that is our main market.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about training and capacity building.  While there is a very strong cohort of foresters and forestry contractors in the country, we advocate a rethink or transition of silvicultural systems in Ireland whereby those same foresters and forestry contractors, as well as the forest owners, will upskill in alternative management of those forests.  We are not looking at an entirely new resource of people or recruitment.

The first is for Dr. Hendrick.  I refer to a study by Dr. Kim Naudts at the University of Amsterdam.<\/p><p>She stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn Europe, two and a half centuries of land-use change increased the forest area by 10% and has put over 85% of the forests under management, but it has failed to result in net CO<sub>2<\/sub>removal from the atmosphere, because wood extraction released carbon otherwise stored in the biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil carbon pools.  In addition, converting deciduous forests into coniferous forests resulted in changes in albedo, canopy roughness, and evapotranspiration from the land surface, which contributed to<br \/><br \/>warming rather than mitigating it.  Hence, any climate framework that includes land management as a pathway for climate mitigation should not only account for land-cover changes but also should equally address changes in forest management, because not all forest management contributes to climate change mitigation.   <\/blockquote><p>Could the witnesses comment on her findings given the Irish context and their opinion of the future of our forest management?  <br\/><br\/>My second question is for Professor N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in.  The comprehensive study showed that the percentage of forest cover in Leitrim is way above the national average.  She also noted that spruce is the dominant species at 61% compared with 51% nationally.  Almost all of those surveyed - 96% - said that they would not under any circumstances consider selling all or part of their holdings for forestry purposes?  They were quite opposed to it and indicated that they did not favour any further afforestation of the county yet Professor N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in states that the resistance to afforestation is often proportional to the length of time a community has been associated with forestry.  Given that Leitrim has seen almost a century of afforestation policy and has very high coverage, does she agree that the resistance to further expansion in this instance is not based on time to afforestation?  <br\/><br\/>I have two questions for the Department.  I come from Dublin city so I am an urbanite.  Twenty years ago through Dublin City Council, the Tree Council of Ireland gave a lot of residents, who took it up, a free tree.  I see that rowan tree growing in my back garden.  It is a private place.  Twenty years ago, we did not have an appreciation of the environmental good that trees do but we do now.  Is involving, educating and encouraging urbanites, who cannot be forgotten when we talk about afforestation, part of the plan?  Does the Department plan to plant 440 million trees by 2040?  <br\/><br\/>My last question is for Ms Hurley, Mr. Murphy and perhaps the Department.  It was said that timber will provide sustainable building materials to replace carbon-heavy steel and concrete.  Walking around Dublin 15 years ago, the facades were wooden.  They became ugly and were banned by Dublin City Council.  Is there a need for local authorities to stipulate that a percentage of the interior infrastructure - not the wooden panels but the holding and bricks - needs to be put in for when submitting a planning application to replace the steel?  When we first started talking about timber frame houses at about the same time, there was stuff about insurance.  Insurance would be so high as to be unaffordable.  Would this still be the case if we were to use wood as a replacement for carbon-heavy steel and concrete?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#J03100","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>There are only about three minutes for those replies so I will start with Dr. Hendrick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The question of whether we should keep the forests and not harvest them in terms of climate change mitigation has been comprehensively addressed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The processors must be able to do it and we must increase the markets for timber, which people want to buy, so that we create more value and can afford to reward all of the people investing in it.<\/p><p>It is a very competitive world.  We have to balance commercial competitiveness and making money out of what we harvest with the environmental mix and the beauty of broad-leaf trees.  Driving that forward is a matter of everybody talking and recognising each other's viewpoints.  The industry wants to reach out and do that to ensure a bigger future for it and for the people.  We see ourselves as a major employer, creating jobs in the area I live in, for example, and keeping people living there. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#K01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":94,"content":"<p>We need actions to follow the statements that are made here.

I take the point made by the two doctors about the proportion of a given holding that is given over to forestry.  Is there scope within the next round of CAP and the next multi-annual financial framework to have clear schemes and financial packages to incentivise climate action among farmers on this island?

I want to start by reminding everyone that the emergency we are currently going through is both a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency.  This is important in the context of this discussion, particularly where Coillte is concerned.  Its representatives say that Coillte manages one fifth of its estate primarily for biodiversity.  I am disappointed to hear that.  It falls well short of what is required.  I used to live beside a Coillte forest in Donegal and I utterly hated it.  The forest floor was dark.  Nothing grew on it.  There were no insects, butterflies or bees and consequently no frogs.  The run-off from the forest made the water acidic, to the point that it would sting.  In discussing reforestation and the number of hectares that are planted we need to be very careful not to repeat the mistakes of the past.  As Einstein said, we do not solve our problems by repeating the mistakes that created them in the first place.  We need a clear path for Coillte to pursue afforestation to the extent that is required in the country without the destruction that has happened in the west of Ireland.<\/p><p>Anyone who has driven through counties Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim or Galway knows that the level of Sitka spruce planting there is offensive to the eye.  <\/p><p> I acknowledge that Ms Hurley is new to the job.  In 2012, there was an attempt to privatise or part privatise Coillte.  I was part of a successful campaign led by Deputy Boyd Barrett to stop the privatisation of the forests.  Are there any plans to sell off part or all of Coillte to private enterprise?<\/p><p> One of the priority recommendations of the working committee that held several meetings on these issues was that there should be a full review conducted of Coillte.  That does not form part of the Government's climate action plan, but it is something that the committee wanted to see happen.  There are many legacy issues in that regard.  May we see the memorandum of understanding between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na?<\/p><p> That kind of leads on to my next question, which is more for the biologists, scientists and eco people.  There is a concern that reforestation of the wetlands may have a net negative effect on sequestration and carbon emissions because bogs and wetlands sequester more carbon than trees potentially do.  If we are going to plant trees on the wetlands, will there be a net impact on our CO2 emissions?  Would it not be better to focus on regenerating the bogs?  Of course, if one does so, the problem is what one says to farmers and others in places such as Leitrim and Mayo in the west of Ireland.  It seems that most of the incentive for reforestation is not going to small farmers of the sort shown in the \"Ear to the Ground\" television programme which featured a lovely farm where trees, cattle and sheep mixed together because there was a lot of space between the trees.  The Department referred to that model.  Where is the financial incentive for the poorer smaller farmers to gain from such reforestation?  All the incentives seem to be going one way.  A resident of County Leitrim interviewed on the RT&Eacute; \"CountryWide\" radio programme stated that Norwegian and Danish investment funds are buying up land.  There are approximately four such funds operating in his village.  Some regular people who have money are buying up the land around the country in order to make more money.  The residents of the village do not want any more Sitka spruce planted.  As was pointed out, 18.9% of County Leitrim is afforested, most of it with Sitka spruce.  To reach the national target of 18%, are we going to further saturate places such as County Leitrim?  According to the man interviewed in that recent edition of \"CountryWide\", global companies are buying up land in poorer areas to plant more forestry.  I would like all or any of the witnesses to try to answer my questions.<\/p><p> On a lighter note, something struck me when Mr. Murphy referred to Forest Industries Ireland making wood pellets: was it involved in the cash-for-ash scandal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#L01900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>To whom was the Deputy's first question addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#M00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>My first question was mainly addressed at the representatives of Coillte.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#M00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I will address some of the questions and then ask Mr. Carlin, who is a forester, to deal with some of the others.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the moves that were made in 2012.

One sometimes gets an increase in greenhouse gas emissions when one starts to rewet them because there is a change from a degrading CO2 to methane being emitted, but that gradually alters.  There is much good evidence that rewetting of wetlands and peatlands gives a net carbon benefit over time.  The forest service has moved away from grant aiding afforestation on peatlands for a significant period.  Some areas with small layers of peat are afforested but they would not be classified as peatland.  There is good research evidence to show that on those soils, which can be highly productive for forestry, that gives a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.  Basically, one must look at the site type and so on.<\/p> <p>  On rewetting and the midland peatlands, a landscape level approach is taken.  It is probable that a substantial portion of the cutaway is suitable for rewetting, which will deliver climate change mitigation benefits.  Other parts are suitable for planting trees.  One must bear in mind that some of these areas in the midlands were once forest.  Some of the basal peat layers come from wood.  Birch, yew and oak grew in those forests a long time ago.  Those areas are suitable for growing trees.  The goal is not blanket afforestation of cutaway, which would be a bad idea.

There is very good evidence to show that if we reduce the moisture content of wood fuels in Ireland from 30% firewood to 20%, which is eminently achievable, we can reduce particulate emissions by a factor of two or three.  As we all know, there is a lot of wood fuel out on the market that has a moisture content of considerably more than 30%.

They have given rise to more questions that I would like to ask.  However, I will try to focus on a few clear points.  While I do not wish to contradict Mr. Hendrick directly, it is important to clarify that when the UN talks about material substitution, sequestration and bioenergy, it is not talking about the same tree.  The need for large numbers of trees requires a huge scale of afforestation - not necessarily commercial afforestation, but afforestation which serves a role in terms of sequestration.  We need to be really clear that there is not an endorsement that all forestry must be commercially exploited as substitution or indeed bioenergy.  That is certainly not the position as I understand it.  The most recent IPCC land use report, which came out earlier this year and has been debated at this committee, seems to contradict any such suggestion.  Other witnesses may wish to comment on this in their responses.  While the report does not use such language, I suggest that a \"keep it in the ground\" perspective is a core element of its approach to land use.<\/p> <p>  The other key function, in addition to those functions, is biodiversity.  We are facing the twin crisis of an ecological crisis with a huge level of species collapse and an absolutely linked climate crisis.  I sometimes worry that the focus on carbon maths causes us to forget about the accelerants of climate change, one of which will be biodiversity loss.<\/p><p>I will focus on that and build on some of the questions Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked.<\/p><p> Mr. Purser mentioned that 70% of the carbon capture is in the soils.  We know that, for example, in the first five years of a tree being planted there can be a carbon loss during that period because of the turning up of soil and so forth.  That is one of the reasons retention of trees for longer and moving away from clear felling is so important.  Mr. Purser indicated that he has concerns about clear felling but I ask the Forest Industries Ireland and Coillte witnesses to be clear on where they stand on continuous cover and whether that is a future policy they will move towards, as they have moved on broadleaf, and the extent to which that policy will become central in the future.<\/p><p> On the issue of broadleaf, we are still looking at a figure of 27% in terms of the species mix in forests planted in 2018.  However, I hear from people who have engaged around forestry and they still find that many foresters talk to them about the practice of broadleaf fringing, that is, broadleaf around the edge of a core, which might be a monocultural crop like Sitka spruce.  That is a major concern.  What measures have been taken to address that practice?  If we are talking to the witnesses in two years time, will Sitka spruce still be a majority in terms of species mix?  What will be the percentage of Sitka spruce in our future forestry plans and what measures will the witnesses introduce to achieve that?<\/p><p> Broadleaf fringing is also an issue in terms of wildlife and biodiversity corridors, and the national pollinator plan.  We have not heard much mention of the national pollinator plan.  How are the witnesses' forestry strategies ensuring effective enhancement of the national pollinator plan?<\/p><p> That brings me to the CAP.  With respect, policy is our business.  We are legislators.  Policy is not an issue that is out of discussion.  We are not asking these questions for the good of our health.  I ask about future policy and the advice, suggestions or recommendations this committee might give towards future policy, which is the reason we are here.  We need more clarity on current policy from the Department.  The application for CAP funding may be a period of time away but as Mr. Hayes acknowledged, the negotiations are happening now.  What is the Irish position on the negotiations in terms of issues such as broadleaf percentages in forestry, the pollinator plans and co-benefits?  That is something that relates to the CAP because rather than talking about an individual farmer, for example, will there be a layer of co-benefits where landowners co-operate with each other around the creation of, say, a pollinator pathway?  Is that something we would be looking to be additionally recognised for and that would be reflected in payments?  Is that an issue on which we are advocating?<\/p><p> Has Ireland taken a position on the issue of clear felling versus continuous cover?  Are we in that discussion?  The reason we are here is to talk about our plans and if a national climate plan is being produced in the coming weeks, it is relevant that we would hear where we are in the negotiations.<\/p><p> There are many issues I want to raise but I will conclude shortly to ensure I have a chance to come back in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#N02700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":151,"content":"<p>The witnesses have five minutes to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#O00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":152,"content":"<p>On a global level, the issues we have heard are how we can make access available for farmers with smaller holdings, linking in biodiversity and ensuring that it is not simply large-scale commercial calculation of carbon in a way that is detrimental in the long term.

The general point I would make around that is that what we try to do all the time is strike a balance in terms of the economic, social and environmental aspects.  From an economic point of view, house builds need to double in Ireland and in the UK.  There is a demand for 3.4 billion cu. m of timber, and timber is a good product.  It is a better product than other carbon-heavy products.  We need those products.  Forty per cent of the world's timber comes from 7% of the world's forests.  Getting timber products efficiently from plantation forests allows us to safeguard our own growth forests.  We need these timber products and we need to get them in an economic way but also in a social and environmental way also.  It is critically important that we understand that we need the timber products.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to silvicultural systems, we operate different silvicultural systems.  We operate long-term attention where we want to keep the forest covered, particularly in recreational areas.  We operate small group felling where we want to change the age structure within the forests.  We operate clear felling reforestation, which is the most productive in terms of timber production, and we operate continuous cover forestry in areas particularly of high biodiversity or landscape sensitivity.  We are trying to look at that balance all the time and ask ourselves what is the best silvicultural treatment to deliver the economic, social and environmental benefits from our forests.  We are open to any dialogue on the best way to achieve that but it is important that we achieve all of those.  We have to have a good recreation and social policy but also protect, enhance and restore biodiversity while keeping a vibrant industry that is producing sustainable products.

The questions from the members have been fantastic.  As elected members, I presume they reflect the demands on forests from society.  It is clear that a great deal is asked of our forests in terms of the social, environmental and commercial services they provide.<\/p><p>It is not a question of saying that these forests are delivering biodiversity, these are delivering recreational value and these are where we go to get our timber.  We can do all those things.  In some forests there is a greater emphasis on one product or service than in others but all forests should be capable of producing many or all those products and services.  We need to get away from the idea that the function of a forest is to produce timber and nothing else.  That has been alluded to and I know that Coillte is working on policies and practices around that.  What we are advocating is the continuous cover forest management system which offers the opportunity to commercially manage forests.  I am speaking from experience here.  Deputy Niamh Smyth very kindly referred to me earlier as an ecologist but I am not an ecologist.  I am a commercial forester; that is my job.  I manage commercial forests for private forest owners whose bottom line is that they need a cheque from timber sales.  They get that cheque but we are also able to manage those forests through skills we have developed to deliver the other social and environmental services.  This is part of a forestry culture that we need to develop in Ireland.  The way in which the forest sector in Ireland developed was related to the fact that we had only 1% of land under forest at the start of the last century.  There was an emphasis on planting new forests and that was achieved.  Now we need to move on and figure out how to transition those forests into more permanent and multifunctional spaces that deliver on the demands of society, as reflected in the questions posed today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#O02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy Purser","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The Department representative wants to respond but we have gone way over time so I ask him to be brief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#P00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.

The Minister has established a CAP consultative committee on which there are environmental NGOs and various other social partners.  That discussion is very much ongoing.  What will the next CAP look like in terms of biodiversity and climate?  It will be a mix of trees, organic farming and a whole host of other things.  I am not sure if Senator Higgins or this committee has made a submission to the CAP consultation process.  Lots of people have made submissions so perhaps that is something for the committee to consider.  Obviously, the high level point still stands.

I note that the average size of a forestry plantation is 7 ha.  I own a young plantation and am very interested in this issue.  I welcome the establishment of Coillte Nature and look forward to seeing how it pans out.  There was some discussion around planting on cutaway bogs.  I accept that some bogs are so cut away that they can only be planted on and cannot be re-wet.  However, data suggests that drainage of peat soils for forestry has a negative effect on greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions into surface water.  We should probably be avoiding draining such soils.  However, Dr. N&iacute; Dh&uacute;bhain indicated that planting on peaty soil no longer happens.  I ask the representatives from the Department or Coillte to confirm that is the case.  If not, should we consider discontinuing that planting practice?  A decision not to drain peat soils for planting means that we need to increase planting on what could be described as better soils.  What is the Department's view of this aspect of our forestry programme?  Agroforestry has been mentioned a number of times today.  I am a big fan of agroforestry and am staggered to hear that we have only 51 ha in the country under agroforestry.  I do not know of any near my home but would love to have some on my own farm.

We have rules which do not allow for any planting on blanket or raised bogs.  The vast majority of planting takes place on mineral soils which are basically wet clay soils that cover large parts of Ireland.  Planting on soils that are a bit peaty can produce emissions in the first number of years but as the forests mature and close canopy, they become a net sink of carbon dioxide.  The Senator is correct in terms of plantations and soil disturbance.

I have a question for Mr. Murphy.  I will not mention the companies involved but am I correct in saying that cut-offs and waste timber left over from a site can be used for different processing or generation activities in Northern Ireland but that the EPA will not grant people in the South licences to use timber in that way?<\/p> <p>  Mr. McAuley asked why people do not want to get into forestry.  He is right.  There is a need for commercial operators.  The likes of ECC Timber and Murray Timber Group provide employment.  We need a certain amount of activity to ensure that we keep jobs in certain areas, such as in Connemara.  The problem is that what has gone on has left a bad taste in many people's mouths.  We have an estimate at the moment.  Will Mr. Hayes tell me what we have not achieved in the last few years?  My understanding is that we have 5,000 ha or 6,000 ha less than our target.  We are now saying that we will plant 8,000 ha per year.  Some 80% of land west of Galway has been designated such that it cannot be planted.  One cannot plant in Mayo.  Going around the country, where will we get the land?  We are living a lie in this room if we believe we are going to achieve something which we will not.  <\/p> <p>  I hope I will be corrected if I am wrong but I have dealt with Departments with regard to people who have bought land from Coillte on which the trees were fit for cutting and in respect of which there was an obligation to plant on raised bog - wet peatland.  Can anyone here tell me that one does not have to replant in that situation?  The fact is that one has to replant on raised bog.  <\/p> <p>  Some 6% of our countryside is covered in forestry, much of which is broadleaf, planted by farmers and State bodies.  Not one bit of this is used in calculating our emissions.  What is our Department doing to resolve that issue?  Such forestry all over Ireland is excluded from these statistics.  Why do we not have schemes for areas of 0.5 acres to 50 acres and an acre to 100 acres?  If we want to encourage the planting of broadleaves to reduce net emissions, shelter belts of 30 broadleaf trees could be planted along ditches under an environmental or CAP scheme without interfering with farming.  We could plant 60,000 ha in one year.  Our big problem is that we do not have the money for it.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. McAuley has asked why farmers are not willing to go down this road.  Coillte has partnerships with farmers with which there are problems it has not addressed.  Mr. McAuley and I both know that, in the business world, one person tells another who tells another.  Coillte says that it is engaging.  Engaging is not solving.  At one time, when one was sowing timber, it was done on the bad piece of land at the back of the garden or the end of the field.  That day is gone now.  That will not happen.  One has to have a better standard of land.  This has left a bad taste in the mouths of many farmers and word spreads.  Farmers are becoming reluctant to plant.  Mr. Hayes will be familiar with the case of a farmer who has been in forestry for three years.  I have contacted him and his people over the last year or 18 months in this regard.  This farmer wants to brash trees for access.  A licence was given to dig drains.  This has been going around in circles.  This person who has planted forestry is trying to improve it and the Department has not addressed the problem.  People wonder why more people are not going down the road of forestry.  How many licences are being stopped by the so-called environmentalists who are going to save the world?  How many roads are being blocked?  How many areas in which people want to plant trees are being blocked?  This in not being addressed.  The Derrybrien case has been a problem.

They need a quick answer, to get their licences, and to be able to get on with it, otherwise they change their minds and do something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019121100002#Q01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark McAuley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the issue of hedgerows.

I am pleased to be joined by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive and senior HSE officials, and to have an opportunity to update the committee regarding current issues.<\/p> <p>   Regarding Sl&aacute;intecare, officials at my Department have been engaging with stakeholders to gain insights into what they want and expect from our health services.  One of the resounding messages to emerge is the need to have a clear and coherent plan.  Sl&aacute;intecare is now that plan.  I am pleased to say that the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is now well under way.  Planning and co-design for the new regional health areas has begun.  Co-design is an important part of Sl&aacute;intecare and means that patients and staff who live and work in the region play a part in setting up that regional structure.  Following consultation with the Sl&aacute;intecare office, I will make a recommendation to the Government on the exact structure of each region early in the new year.  <\/p> <p>  A forum to provide a regular platform for dialogue between the State and voluntary providers of health and social care services is also being set up.  It will have an overarching mandate to build a stronger relationship between the State and voluntary providers for the benefit of patients and service users.  The forum will meet for the first time in December.  I had an opportunity to address an initial meeting of that forum, and I thank Mr. Peter Cassells for agreeing to chair it.  The integration fund of &euro;20 million is supporting 122 projects across the country and, via that &euro;20 million, we will hire 300 additional staff to work in the community.  In each of the Deputies' constituencies, therefore, Sl&aacute;intecare projects are now up and running in each county delivering reform in health services on the ground in our communities.  <\/p> <p>  To reduce community waiting lists, an important and sensitive issue, we will spend &euro;60 million between now and 2021 to employ an additional 1,000 community healthcare staff by the end of 2020.  These will be people able to treat our citizens closer to home.  In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of primary care centres.  Some 127 primary care centres are open, but it is fair to make the point that we need to staff them better.  Deputy O'Reilly has made that point vigorously and regularly.  We have fine buildings and they are needed because they bring about a new and better way of working and new opportunities for our patients to access services locally.  We need to increase the staff in those facilities now, and that is what these 1,000 additional staff, the Sl&aacute;intecare workforce as I like to call them, are about as well.<\/p> <p>  I am acutely aware that along with any long-term plan, and we do need a long-term plan, we also need to address the issues facing us today.  I acknowledge the challenges facing accident and emergency departments in our hospitals and I accept that in some it is particularly difficult for our patients and staff.  The Government allocated a budget of an additional &euro;26 million to assist the HSE over the winter.  Specifically, this funding was to support and improve access to the fair deal scheme, helping our citizens to get into nursing homes quicker and to also provide additional homecare, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion.  <\/p> <p>  Specific funding has been allocated to local winter action teams to support initiatives at local level.  This is important.  Everything cannot just be about the Department of Health, the HSE and Dr. Steevens' Hospital deciding what individual areas are doing.  This process has to be about resourcing and empowering local winter action teams to enable them to respond to issues as they arise in their regions.  I am pleased to confirm a range of new and additional measures to alleviate pressures on accident and emergency departments.  The HSE has reached an agreement with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to open up to 190 extra hospital beds in the coming weeks.  When we factor in these 190 extra beds with the 40 additional beds in the modular unit in Clonmel, due to open in the new year, that brings us to a total of 230 additional hospital beds that will open between now and the start of 2020.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, the NTPF has written to each hospital groups and, as of today, I confirm that 83 beds have now approved, of the overall 190 beds.  These additional beds are in Letterkenny, Tullamore, Waterford, Cork, the national children's hospital and Limerick, in St. John's Hospital.<\/p><p>It is a matter that Senator Kieran O'Donnell has pursued with me as well.<\/p><p> The NTPF is continuing to engage with hospital groups to finalise the details of the additional capacity but the message is very simple.  If a hospital has opportunities to open additional capacity in its facilities, a nearby hospital or a level 2 or level 3 hospital, we will look at how we can fund that through the NTPF.  I commend both the NTPF and the HSE on the collaborative way they are working in this regard.  There are 230 additional hospital beds, including the Clonmel modular unit, and it is a very significant increase in capacity on top of the &euro;26 million already provided.<\/p><p> I confirm that in the coming week, I will sign a new statutory instrument to reduce the cost of attendance at a minor injury unit to &euro;75.  For many years, people have commented on the fact that it seems a little bizarre that we are trying to encourage people to attend a minor injury unit if it is the appropriate place to go but the cost of going to the minor injury unit was the same as the cost of going to an accident and emergency department.  That is &euro;100 if a person does not have a medical card.  In an effort to further incentivise use of our minor injury units, I have decided to reduce the cost to &euro;75.  That statutory instrument is currently being legally drafted and I expect to be able to sign it in the coming week.  I know the HSE will then implement it with immediate effect.  It will also provide an opportunity locally in the 11 minor injury units across the country to reinforce the importance of using the minor injury unit where we know people can be in and out in 90 minutes, two hours or even less time for many conditions.  That is without needing to go to the accident and emergency department, which is good news.<\/p><p> I am also working with Government colleagues to identify some additional funding for more social care supports on top of what we have already done.  There is &euro;26 million already in a winter plan and additional money is going to the HSE for the NTPF to open more beds; this relates to the 190 additional beds and the 40 beds in Clonmel.  On top of that I expect to be in the position within the next week to make further announcements on additional funding for extra support for home care, transitional care and some very good and innovative ideas that HSE colleagues have been working on at a hospital group level in recent days and weeks.  I wanted to update the committee on those new measures to try to provide additional assistance to our health service at what is a very busy time.<\/p><p> We have seen significant progress on waiting times for scheduled care.  It is not often heard or articulated but we should be clear that as a result of increased activity and the ongoing work between the HSE and the NTPF, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure - a hospital operation or procedure - fell to 66,594 in November from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.  Month on month we are seeing in this country the number of people waiting for a hospital operation falling and the number of people having their hospital operation in less than three months is increasing.  Approximately 32% of people were getting their hospital operation in three months or less in 2017 and that figure is now 42%.  More than four in ten of us are now getting a hospital operation in 12 weeks or less, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare target.  We must build on that and increase the 42% figure even further.  We have seen an overall reduction of 23% in the number of people waiting for a hospital procedure.  The number of patients waiting more than three months has fallen by 21,400, or 37%, from July 2017 to November 2019.  There are fewer people waiting for a hospital operation and more people are being seen more quickly in connection with that operation.  There are fewer people waiting longer for such hospital operations as well.<\/p><p> We speak of waiting lists as if they are part of a global conversation but we can consider some of the specialties.  Ophthalmology relates to the treatment of eyes and the number of people waiting over three months for a procedure in this area fell by 63% from July 2017 to the end of November 2019.  In the ear, nose and throat specialty, the number of people waiting over three months for a procedure fell by 58% from 2017 to 2019.  The number of people waiting over three months for a cardiology procedure fell by 33%.  The world and its mother knows there are major challenges in our health services but it is important to acknowledge the progress being made by very hard-working staff, coupled with significant investment from the Government, in decreasing waiting times for hospital operations or procedures.<\/p><p> The key must now be our outpatients.  We need to consider how we can drive down the length of time people are waiting to see a hospital consultant.  That is why we will use a significant amount of the additional resources being provided to the NTPF to put in place further targeted measures in this regard.  We have seen the outpatient waiting list fall for three months in a row and we will see it fall for four months in a row.<\/p><p>For the first time in a long time the number of people waiting to see a hospital consultant is falling month on month, although it is still far too high.  My conversations with consultants will focus on how additional money for them will be about reforming how they work and how we make sure that public patients are not continually pushed to the bottom of hospital queues over those who can afford to pay for private health insurance.  We will be working with the HSE, the NTPF and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office to produce plans for 2020 that will build on the progress that has been made to date.  We are working to identify initiatives that will meet the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This is not the bad old days of the NTPF turfing out money to private hospitals.  Any initiative funded through the NTPF in 2020 must meet the Sl&aacute;intecare objectives and must include innovative approaches to increase activity, avoid hospital attendances and better utilise our smaller hospitals and our primary care centres.  The NTPF is not the NTPF of the Celtic tiger, when it was just a funding pot for private hospitals.  It must be used as an access fund for the public health service as well.  <\/p><p> A key focus for 2020 will be on moving care to more appropriate settings.  We have a number of specialties working in this regard, including ENT, orthopaedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, urology and gynaecology.  There are significant opportunities to make progress in those areas in 2020.  We will also be seeking to maximise the use of advanced nursing practitioners.  The days of everything being done by the doctor is an outdated model.  We have extremely well-qualified nurses in this country and advanced nurse practitioners who can lead clinics and provide entire episodes of care.  We also have physiotherapists who can manage orthopaedic clinics and people who can provide ophthalmology services in the community.  This extra funding must be about reform as well.<\/p><p> I would like to comment briefly on the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, aggregate report on cervical cancer and the CervicalCheck programme.  As the committee will be aware, on Tuesday, 3 December, I published the aggregate report of the independent expert panel review led by RCOG.  The committee will have an opportunity to discuss the report in detail on 18 December, when it will hear from both patient advocates and the college.  I do not intend to fill either of those spaces but it would be remiss of me not to make some comment.<\/p><p> I thank the expert panel who conducted this review and, in particular, all of the women and their next-of-kin who agreed to participate in it through the examination of the performance of the CervicalCheck programme.  The findings and conclusions contained in the review provide reassurance and, I hope, assist in restoring confidence in our programme and address its importance and quality, while also highlighting the sad and painful reality of the limitations of all of our screening programmes.  RCOG was asked to do this body of work for two reasons.  First, we felt, and rightly so, that the women of Ireland who had had cervical cancer deserved to have an independent clinical review of their screening history.  Second, the Government and I, as Minister for Health, wanted to be able to answer the questions that women were asking at a very difficult time for our screening service, namely, \"Can I have confidence in our screening programme?\" and \"Is our screening programme working effectively?\".  The good news is that the report finds that the CervicalCheck programme is working effectively and, crucially, that women can have confidence in the programme.  As I said earlier, the committee will have an opportunity next week to tease through the report in much greater detail with RCOG.  The key conclusions of the expert panel are that the CervicalCheck programme has undoubtedly saved the lives of many of those who participated in the review, that the programme is working effectively and that women can have confidence in it.<\/p><p> The panel emphasises that it is important to recognise the serious impact that screening failures have on the lives of women and their families.  Cervical cancer is a disgusting and devastating disease that disproportionately affects younger women.  It takes the lives of approximately 100 Irishwomen every year.  Some 300 women will get a diagnosis of cervical cancer each year.  Screening, in every country in the world, inevitably will have limitations.  There are limitations when it comes to cytology-based screening but this should not be taken to suggest the programme overall is not working.  As Minister, I have to reference the importance of the programme and how effectively it is working but that is not to in any way not acknowledge the significant pain and trauma of those who have cervical cancer and those who have been caught up in this awful debacle in regard to the non-disclosure of an audit.  If we are to achieve our goal of making cervical cancer a rare disease in this country, effectively eradicating it within a generation in Ireland, it is vital that women continue to attend for screening and that we continue to build on the considerable progress in other areas over the course of this year.  Smear test turnaround times, an issue on which I have been rightly scrutinised at this committee on many occasions, has stabilised.  I thank the staff of CervicalCheck and the HSE for their incredible work in this regard.  Implementation of Dr. Scally's recommendations is well under way.<\/p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, which is only weeks away, we will move to HPV primary screening, becoming one of the first countries in the world to do so.  I have written to the HSE to ask it to consider the recommendations from the review in the context of this crucial project to ensure it absolutely is delivered by the end of the first quarter of 2020.  I know it absolutely will be.<\/p><p> I am also pleased we have put in place another key element in restoring trust and confidence not just in screening but in our health service.  This is the patient safety Bill, which committee members will scrutinise here and in the D&aacute;il.  It will commence in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  It will bring about mandatory open disclosure.  As Dr. Scally said, when things go wrong in the health service, people want a sincere and genuine apology.  They want to know there is an understanding of what happened and an assurance it will not happen again.  The patient safety Bill will focus on open disclosure and will signal a new era for the health service.  The legislation will establish a robust and future-proofed framework for mandatory open disclosure.  Importantly, it will require notification of serious patient safety incidents to the external regulator, be it HIQA or the Mental Health Commission.  No doubt, this will contribute to national patient safety learning and improvement.<\/p><p> Importantly, mandatory open disclosure will apply not just to the public health service but also to the private health service.  For the first time we will extend the remit of HIQA to the private health service.  The new patient safety Bill places clear responsibilities and obligations on health service providers to ensure mandatory open disclosure occurs and external notification to the regulator takes place.  It is a significant cultural and legal change.<\/p><p> I understand the committee is interested in the care of women who have been affected by the use of mesh implants.  I have met the mesh survivors group on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 November, and I have listened to their personal stories.  I acknowledge very sincerely Deputy O'Reilly's work in this regard as an advocate and, perhaps, and interlocutor on occasion, for the advocacy group with the Government and the Department.  I acknowledge the very constructive way she has put forward their case and engaged with me.  I want to be very clear that I am fully committed to ensuring that all women who develop mesh related complications receive high-quality, multidisciplinary and patient-centred care.<\/p><p> Since the issue came to my attention in late 2017, an ongoing priority focus for the Department and the HSE has been to understand the clinical and technical issues and to put in place the necessary structures for, and the provision of, care for women who have been affected by the use of mesh.  It is very clear to me when I meet the women and hear their stories the trauma, pain and agony they have been put through.  Quite frankly, there has been physical agony and mental anguish.  I requested the chief medical officer to do a body of work.  He thoroughly examined the issue and prepared a report for me on the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures and responding to women experiencing mesh complications.  We published the report in November last year.  It includes a number of significant recommendations in a number of key areas.  It also put a pause on the use of mesh in Ireland until we get to a point when we can be satisfied that all of the recommendations have been met.  The HSE has advised that a package of care is now available for women who have been identified with urgent or immediate needs.  In addition, the HSE's service plan will ensure the continued implementation of the chief medical officer's report on transvaginal mesh as a priority action.  We are also continuing to progress the delivery of care pathways for women, including a specialist, multidisciplinary national mesh complications service.<\/p><p> I am also looking at the issue of access to medical cards.  I had a very good discussion with the group and Deputy O'Reilly about whether we can provide a medical card in circumstances where somebody has been through the service and an identified issue has been established.  I believe we can make progress.  I have been asked to put in place a process for the voices of women to be heard and I have made a commitment to do this.  We are developing proposals on an independent compassionate process for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard.  I have written to Mesh Survivors Ireland in this regard.  Work is under way.  I am happy to deal with any questions in this regard.<\/p><p> I do not underestimate the significant challenges our health service faces but I do not accept that everything in the health service is bad or in crisis.  Every day our staff do an excellent job of providing high-quality care to many people.  We are making progress when it comes to waiting lists.  Today, I announced a significant number of measures on additional capacity in the health service and additional resources for the winter.  We will build further on this in the days and weeks ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#D00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms. Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, and Mr. Liam Woods, national director for acute operations.<\/p> <p>  The latest financial position, from the end of the third quarter, shows a variance from budget, including first charge, of &euro;319 million, or 3%.<\/p><p>Of this, &euro;119 million or 37% is in respect of our operational service areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was almost 100% higher at &euro;636 million, with &euro;507 million of that overrun, or 80%, in the operational service areas.  Pension and demand-led areas account for &euro;200 million of the variance as of September 2019.<\/p><p> A key priority for the HSE is to maximise the provision of safe services to the people we serve while operating within the funding provided to us.  This continues to be a significant challenge in the context of the ever-increasing level of demand for our services.  This demand is influenced by factors such as a growing population, an ageing demographic, changes in technology and clinical practice, as well as ongoing societal and economic change.  We have continued with our intensive focus on current year financial management and financial planning for 2020.  Senior managers across the organisation have been engaging with us regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services are in respect of providing residential placements to people with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialist emergency care within the acute hospital setting, particularly in the context of an ageing population with increasingly complex needs.  The costs within our pensions and demand-led areas are in the main driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic environment and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  State Claims Agency reimbursements are also within this area, and there is a significant and ongoing focus on mitigating, in so far as is practical, the underlying risks and issues that give rise to claims.<\/p><p> A key focus for our ongoing financial management efforts has been on improving compliance with our pay and staffing controls, including whole-time equivalents, WTEs, agency and overtime.  Although staffing levels will increase again in 2019, any increases must be managed in a way that is both planned and affordable.  This necessary adjustment to the controls on pay and staffing is proving difficult but it must become part of our normal way of working.  I acknowledge that this is a challenging process, but I and the board are committed to ensuring that there is an improved culture of delivery within the funding provided by the State.  I fully believe that this will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which ultimately will be in the best interest of our service users and their families.<\/p><p> My monthly financial meetings with community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and hospital group CEOs will continue to year end.  All areas are very clear about their allocated financial limits and performance expectations up to year end to mitigate in so far as practical any deviations from those limits, thereby reducing the extent of any challenge to be dealt with in 2020.  The discipline of these monthly financial meetings will continue throughout 2020.  Indeed, I met all the hospital group CEOs and CHOs just yesterday.  The HSE's national service plan for 2020 was adopted by the HSE board and submitted to the Minister for consideration.  The approval process is well advanced and I expect that the plan will be published within the next week.<\/p><p> The Minister has made some comments on winter planning.  Following on from the briefing provided to the committee in September of this year on winter preparedness planning, the HSE has prepared a detailed winter plan, which was launched in November.  The plan clearly reflects the year-on-year growth in demand for unscheduled care services that is growing at a rate of in excess of 5% in attendances and 2.7% in admissions over a mean annual population growth of 1.7%.  In response to this increased demand, an additional &euro;26 million has been provided to year end to fund a combination of nationally and locally managed initiatives aimed at improving overall patient flow from community, through the acute hospital and back into the community.<\/p><p> A sum of &euro;19.2 million from this funding is specifically focused on egress initiatives, including home care packages, improving access to the nursing home support scheme or fair deal, and transitional care beds for patients awaiting nursing home places.  The initiatives have in fact been in place since October in preparation for the anticipated winter surge and have enabled the system to respond.  Nine local winter action teams are in place and are co-chaired by the relevant community healthcare organisation chief officer and their hospital group CEO colleagues.<\/p><p> The balance of &euro;6.8 million has been distributed on the basis of population associated with each of the winter action teams, and this is funding initiatives such as enhanced community intervention teams; additional frailty intervention therapy teams, FITTs; aids and appliances to assist in discharge; enhanced triage capability; and additional bed capacity in private facilities.  The HSE at national level and at winter action team level is also engaged with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in providing enhanced access to diagnostics, which will improve overall patient experience times and alleviate pressure in the emergency department and wider hospital services.<\/p><p>On Sl&aacute;intecare, the HSE and the Department of Health continue to engage and work collaboratively on its implementation.  A key element of this work is service redesign to plan for the implementation of the new regional health regions and social care delivery structures.  In parallel with this work, I have also commenced a review of the HSE staffing and structures at the centre of the organisation as part of the preparatory work to inform the service redesign for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused national centre.<\/p><p> I mention employment levels and recruitment.  In October 2019, our overall employment levels stand at 138,080 personnel, equating to 119,473 whole-time equivalents, WTEs.  This represents a total growth in our employment levels this year of 1,616 WTEs and year-on-year growth from October of last year of 2,562 WTEs.  Our continued growth is important in the context of our overarching pay and numbers strategy.  We have filled and continue to fill approved and funded development posts in order to maintain and enhance key services for patients and their families.  In parallel, we are working to ensure levels of agency, overtime and pay costs, which reached unaffordable levels by the end of 2018, are brought within what is affordable and sustainable during 2019 and into 2020.  We have continued to grow our workforce, and year-on-year the largest of this growth in WTE terms, is in our staff categories of nursing and midwifery and patient and client care, which predominantly concerns healthcare assistant staff, with both categories showing growth of 650 WTEs and 646 WTEs, respectively.  In percentage terms, our largest year-on-year workforce growth is in our medical and dental staff category, which has seen a 3.7% increase since October last year.  Similarly, it is also the largest staff category growth in percentage terms this year to date at 3.4% growth.  Notably within these figures, our consultant workforce has grown by 142 WTEs year-on-year, with 135 WTEs of this increase recruited since January 2019.  As we draw to a close in 2019, we will continue to proceed with the approved and funded development posts in tandem with the requirement to keep within an affordable funding level that is sustainable both in 2019 and 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":249,"content":"<p>We will open the discussion to members, starting with Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#J00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here this morning.  I would like to start locally with Purple House Cancer Support in Bray.  It is an incredible cancer support service that the Minister for Health and I know well.  It supports families and cancer survivors all over Wicklow and in south Dublin.  It has to leave the premises it is in on an extremely urgent basis.  It has found a fantastic premises that will allow it to expand its services and it looked for &euro;650,000 from the State with a view to doing matched funding.  After conversations with the Minister, staff from Purple House Cancer Support have told me that figure came down to about &euro;400,000.  They told me they met the Minister twice and he made promises around that amount of money.  They then said the amount promised dropped from about &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000 down to &euro;150,000 and that yesterday they got a letter which one of the Minister's team took them through.  That letter made no reference to any amount of money, it said there would be no money in 2019 and that they could apply for capital funding in 2020 but that would be considered in the round with a lot of other applications.  This is what the staff in Purple House Cancer Support have said to me.  I know the Minister and I both support this service.  Will the Minister deliver on the promise of around &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000?  If not, can the Minister tell me why the staff in Purple House Cancer Support believe that promise was made by him?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#J00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>As the Deputy said, both of us know Purple House Cancer Support very well.  I also know all the other cancer support groups across our county well and I also know that in my time as Minister, the level of annual funding for Purple House Cancer Support has significantly increased by &euro;100,000.  It now receives annual funding of &euro;175,000 and no other cancer support group in County Wicklow receives such funding.  I am sure the Deputy's concern for cancer patients in Bray is shared by a concern he would have for Greystones Cancer Support, Arklow Cancer Support, West Wicklow Cancer Support and Wicklow Cancer Support.  When one is Minister for Health, one is Minister for the whole country and one is a Deputy for one's whole constituency.  I have worked with Deputies in this committee on these matters.  For example, I have worked with Deputy Kelly to secure funding for Tipperary Cancer Support Centre and there is a process to go through.  Funding can be provided for Purple House Cancer Support and I have engaged with my Secretary General and the HSE on this matter.<\/p><p>That funding will assist Purple House Cancer Support in finding a new premises and I have had discussions with its representatives in that regard.  I do not relate all the discussions I have with my constituents, although of course my constituents can do that, but I believe that funding can be found.  I have had significant conversations with officials in the HSE and my Department about that matter.<\/p><p> I am also very much aware, as is the Deputy, of the rules on procurement and governance and that business cases and valuation reports are needed.  The letter that was shared yesterday with Purple House Cancer Support in an effort to be helpful provides some useful information on the next steps that need to be taken.  For example, the letter specifically states that while Purple House Cancer Support has produced a business case, it has not made a formal submission for capital funding.  The business case it has put together contains some of the information required but not all of the required documentation.  The letter included an offer that the local HSE estates office would assist with documentation and in completing the process.  It also made a number of other important points, including that the HSE would need a valuation report if taxpayers' money is to be spent.  The Deputy and I understand that.  If that were not the case, serious questions would be asked in the Committee of Public Accounts and other places.  <\/p><p> A technical report on the suitability of a building would also be needed.  It would be unusual to designate one building because generally, when one is spending taxpayers' money, one would look at a range of properties.  I am aware of the property concerned and the reason the group believes it is suitable, and I can see why that is the case.  My message to the Deputy and to Purple House Cancer Support is that we should work together on this.  I am more than happy to work with Deputy Donnelly.  We can make progress but there are rules, processes and procedures that need to be followed.  With the greatest of respect, a demand from the Deputy or anybody else issued through the local media is not how to bring about the spending of taxpayers' money.  That should be done by investing in good services and taking the very helpful advice provided yesterday by the chief officer of the HSE in the area in question on what would be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#J00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I have met representatives of Purple House Cancer Support and discussed this issue at length.

My understanding is that a letter issued to the Minister yesterday, which I presume he will receive at some point today, laying out the board's inability to do that.  The board will meet tomorrow week, or in eight days, to consider whether it can keep the facility open.  If there is no movement, the board may feel it has no choice but to withdraw from the deed of agreement with the NTPF.  That would mean that from 1 January there would be no fair deal funding for the fair deal residents in the facility.  While St. Joseph's would endeavour to keep the residents there for as long as possible, the reserves of the St. John of God organisation are gone and ultimately the residents would have to leave.

A block grant needs to be provided for one to two years, or for an appropriate timeframe, to cover the gap between the NTPF amount, which is approximately &euro;1,350, and the run-rate, which is approximately &euro;1,750.  The NTPF fair deal scheme is under review.  St. Joseph's, the staff, residents and their families need to be given time in the context of that review.  Option one is the provision of a grant from the HSE or the Department of Health that bridges the gap until a new NTPF rate is agreed as part of a new NTPF strategy.  Option two, which St. Joseph's is open to, is that the HSE takes over the beds as section 39 beds.  The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated given that the board is meeting in eight days.  Are either of those two options viable and could movement be achieved in the next eight days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#K01400","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for raising this serious issue and for his active work in this area as well.

I believe St. Joseph's to be a model of excellence when it comes to the provision of care for people with dementia.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly rightly acknowledged that the element directly within the control of the HSE was swiftly resolved.

The NTPF has made known to the HSE and, I think, St. Joseph's, that its appeals process will be expedited.  St. Joseph's needs to exhaust that process.  If that brings a resolution, we will all be happy.  Deputy Donnelly's question, as I understand it, is what will be done to keep St. Joseph's open if that process is exhausted swiftly and does not deliver a resolution.  My message today is as clear as it was on day one - we will find a mechanism to keep it open.  I need everyone to follow the rules in terms of exhausting the NTPF process.

I will get to them very quickly.  I thank the witnesses for attending.  I know the issue of mesh implants was mentioned in the Minister's statement.  I echo the constructive engagement we have had and the progress that has been made but I would like to see a date for when the medical cards will be issued and access to the translabial scanner will be officially available.  We know that it is coming and the engagement has been extremely constructive but at this stage, if the women could get some firm dates, it would be very helpful.  It might be more appropriate to correspond with me on that.  I have no difficulty with that.<\/p> <p>  The next issue is the departure of Dr. Kevin McCarthy from the children's chronic pain clinic at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Hospital.  This issue has been covered fairly extensively in the media but has also been raised directly with me by constituents.  Dr. McCarthy does an extremely important job.  He provides pain relief to children.  I do not know how he does it.  I am being told is that there has been no formal communication to date with parents.  When I say I am being told this, what I mean is that I am being told that by parents whose children are under the care of Dr. McCarthy.  I know that the consultant group at Children's Health Ireland has written to senior management.  It is asking a number of questions that I want to put here  The questions relate to an immediate clarification of how Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin plans to deliver a pain service once Dr. McCarthy has left.  There does not seem to be a plan.  When I say there has been no formal communication with parents, what I mean is that nobody has sat in a room and told parents how pain management for their children will be dealt with the consultant departs.  I am seeking an assurance that the reason for Dr. McCarthy's departure will be addressed, including the lack of funding.  He was very clear and explicit as to why he was leaving.  He cited the lack of funding and provision of support services required for the safe running of a multidisciplinary pain management team.  Obviously, reassurance is being sought that the families of affected patients will be informed formally.  Obviously, these families all know because it has been in the media but they have not received formal notification that the pain consultant will be departing and, more importantly, nobody has told them what the care pathway for their children will be.  These are children who suffer really severe pain and if they are under the care of Dr. McCarthy, as the Minister well knows, notwithstanding all the facts, they are children who have been on a waiting list because a person does not get to see a consultant overnight.  He or she must wait so these children have waited a long time and are now under the care of a consultant but that consultant is departing and there appears to be no care plan in place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#M00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising this issue.

HIQA says that the cot spacing between babies is inadequate.  It also says that there is no additional or spare neonatal intensive care unit capacity in other units nationally and therefore the national neonatal intensive care system is in a precarious state as the Rotunda caps its admissions.  On the adult high dependency unit, it says that there is a lack of space around the bed to allow for full resuscitation to be instigated and the necessary equipment to be brought into the room.  I will not read all of this out for fear some pregnant woman is watching this and ends up terrified.  These are issues that have been raised with the Minister and the HSE on more than one occasion.

She could not wait for a public appointment so her family clubbed together, with money they did not really have, to ensure that she could get an operation privately.  Following on from that, she developed septicemia and was admitted to hospital.  However, because she had previously been a private patient, she was brought into the private wing of the hospital.  This elderly lady who had septicemia did not know where she was being brought.  She was brought to the private wing in the hospital.

We spoke about similar scenarios when we were discussing women who went for private tests in the context of CervicalCheck and the Minister confirmed that even if a woman had a private test, she could go back into the public system.  This woman, through no fault of her own, was filtered back into the private system and now has an outstanding bill and is being pursued by debt collectors.  Nobody in the debt collection agency cares about the fact that the woman has a medical card, or about her means or her capacity to pay.  All those in the agency care about is recovering the debt.  I believe the use of debt collection agencies should cease because it has no place in the public health service.  No compassion is being shown to this woman.

I appreciate that Mr. Reid has agreed to visit UHL because several committee members would like to go the hospital with him in the coming days.  I am not interested in dramatics but in solutions.  I have written to Mr. Reid about UHL and the mid-west more generally.  Deputy Harty is also from the mid-west and knows that what is going on there at the moment is catastrophic.  I had to beg for a new CT scanner, which is due to be delivered on Friday, because it was so obviously needed.  I have made a comparison between the resources at UHL and at Beaumont Hospital and the disparity is frightening.  These are similar hospitals in similar areas.  While it is true that apples cannot be compared with apples or oranges with oranges in the context of hospitals, the differential in staff numbers, including doctors, nurses and administrative staff, is huge and makes no sense.  The reconfiguration of hospitals in the mid-west was done at the wrong time and without sufficient money.  We all know what happened and it is not the fault of anyone in this room but we are now left in a dreadful situation, where people, including members of my own family, are afraid to go into UHL.  I do not blame them.  The differential across support staff, administrative staff, nurses, medical staff and other health care professionals is huge.  I will not even bother going through the figures, which were provided by the HSE.  In terms of the number of beds we are looking at 432 versus 659.  I know that Professor Keane is currently preparing a report but I do not have any faith in that process because the amount of time spent there was very short.  I do not want a report to be published that is about process but not about resources because the two go hand in hand.  We cannot solve problems in the mid-west without dealing with the resource issue.  People are afraid to address the resource issue.<\/p><p>It is then perceived as blame.  I am gone beyond worrying about blame.  Of course there are process issues but the resource gaps here are ginormous compared to other hospitals.  I put forward a range of interim short-term solutions.  I have listed them multiple times on the record of the D&aacute;il and in the committee and they have all been ignored.  I am really worried about the narrative being put out and being influenced with regard to University Hospital Limerick from a HSE corporate point of view versus what is real on the ground with the staff and management in the hospital, whom I do not blame because they work as hard as they can.<\/p><p> A report has come out in the past 48 hours that has been done by two pretty eminent NHS doctors, Dr. Chris Moulton and Dr. Cliff Mann.  It shows their estimate that since 2016 of those who have been waiting in an NHS accident and emergency department for between six and 11 hours almost 5,500 have died.  If we extrapolate this data what does it mean for us here in Ireland?  I ask the Minister what we will we do.  I ask him not to list all the stuff about the MRI and a few extra beds because I have heard it all before.  They will not have the impact.  I live there.  It is chronically bad.  It is catastrophic.  People will die in the coming months.  What are we going to do?  I am begging the Minister.  We need solutions.  People living near me will potentially die because of this and this is despite the fact that everyone in the hospital is working so hard.  Please, this is a last request to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Q01100","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelly for raising the matter.

I will focus on one or two issues.  I have raised the issue of cataract operations in Cork over the past six or eight weeks.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware there is a huge problem regarding cataract operations being done in Cork.  Last year, the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital sent out over 600 cases to the NTPF.  I have made a submission to the Minister, which I understand has also gone to the HSE, that were an extra theatre put in place in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, ten or 12 cataract operations could be done a day, five days a week.  There are five consultants in that area in that hospital; they each have only one day per week in theatre.  As a result, they are dealing with very serious eye complaints and therefore, cataract operations are pushed to the back and are not being dealt with.  I am advised that were there a second theatre dealing with this, the problem would be resolved and that it would pay for itself within a year and a half to two years.  The cost is &euro;3 million.  Can I get a detailed reply to that submission?  Many people are travelling outside of Cork, some to Northern Ireland, and it is the direct result of the facility not being there to do the operation.  <\/p><p> The second question relates to the growth in the population of Cork.  Much work has been done around new hospitals in Dublin and we are talking about three elective hospitals around the country.  They are vital for the areas for which they are designated.  What progress has been made in respect of Cork or when we can progress the process?  Even if we identified a site this morning, it would take at least two years to go through the design and planning process and being realistic, it would be three years before reaching the stage of putting in foundations.  It needs to be prioritised in Cork.  A huge amount of work is going out of Cork at present because it lacks the capacity to deal with all the work that is there.  There is a population of more than 550,000, which will grow dramatically in the next three to four years, when one considers the development of new offices and all the companies expanding in Cork.  There will be an automatic growth in population, as well as catering for the work out of Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, and Kerry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#T03000","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising these matters.  On his proposal to use the South Infirmary for cataract operations, as an example I refer to the investment we made through the NTPF working with the HSE in Nenagh hospital, where the hospital group came forward with a proposal to say that it had underutilised theatres and with an investment of about &euro;1 million, from memory, that it could open a centre of excellence for cataract procedures.  That has dramatically reduced waiting times and waiting lists for cataract procedures.  My opening statement noted the significant fall we had seen in the waiting times for ophthalmology.  The Senator has sent his proposal to myself and the HSE.  I suggest that the HSE and NTPF, working together, could consider that in the context of 2020.  I do not know enough about the individual projects but to be clear, we are very eager, and it is Government policy, to use the NTPF resource, which is now up at &euro;100 million, to increase capacity in the public health service, where possible, rather than using the private health service.  It is necessary to use the private health service from time to time but where possible, the public health service should be used.  We certainly will look at it through that prism.  I will also ask Dr. Henry to comment.<\/p> <p>  On the population of Cork, which the Senator consistently and robustly raises, he is correct about the population of Cork having grown so much and that the bed stock and health service needs to grow to fit the population.  I have received initial proposals and feedback from the South-South West hospital group on its views on an elective hospital for Cork.  Under the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office, we established an expert group to look at what an elective hospital is, without being smart about it.  Different countries do different things, so it is asking what is provided in an elective hospital and what is not provided.<\/p><p>There are different models around the world.  We expect to be in a position at the start of 2020, which is only weeks away, although it sounds ages away, to move forward on site selection.  Dr. Henry might wish to add to my points on both issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#U00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>First, in regard to eyes, it is not just a question of additional theatre capacity because it is a matter of how we use existing theatres.  Treatment for macular degeneration sometimes constitutes an inappropriate use of a theatre.  A treatment room could equally effectively and safely provide the same treatment.  The consultant ophthalmologist community in Cork has raised this.  There have been successful endeavours in Nenagh and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital whereby we commissioned additional work in theatres through the NTPF, addressing something that lends itself readily to such initiatives, namely, day-case cataract work.<\/p> <p>  With regard to scheduled care, as the Minister said, the most important point is to get the design right and consider the scope of what a scheduled care hospital would look like.  Let me give two examples.  In the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Scotland, there is a large scheduled care hospital that runs a range of services, right up to services that require intensive care, overnight stays and quite intensive, complicated surgery.  Another example is Omagh hospital in the North.  It is a scheduled care hospital that does not have inpatient beds at all.  There are day hospital beds.  The design is crucial because it has to address waiting list needs as they stand and as they are projected, and our population needs.  There has to be a model of care that is sustainable, particularly in view of the recruitment and manpower required.  The work the Minister said is ongoing will come to a conclusion soon.  Once the scope of scheduled care centres is decided, it will inform the design, location and so on the schedule care hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":410,"content":"<p>There are five cataract consultants.

It is a detailed proposal from the clinical director in South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.

The number of consultants has increased from approximately 2,100 to more than 3,100 since 2009.  Can we get current figures?  Various figures are being bandied about and we have do not have accurate figures.  How many consultants are in permanent pensionable posts, how many are locums and how many are working in an agency capacity?  Can we have a breakdown of those numbers?  It is important to know the numbers.  There is a great deal of information in circulation and it is very hard to understand who has the real figures.  I am looking for clarification.

What amount of planning is occurring?  I am sure the retirements are happening in other areas also.  Planning does not appear to be occurring.  Posts seem to be advertised once a person is retired and, therefore, locums have to be brought in to fill the post.<\/p><p> I received telephone calls from three different hospitals about people who are advised to meet Mr. Reid but who do not raise any concerns about any issues in their hospital because they want to give a good impression of what is happening there.  Staff are actually being advised not to raise concerns.  Is the feedback staff have about very genuine concerns not being fed back directly to Dr. Henry?  I have heard staff from three different hospitals raise this issue.  The only ones who seem to be raising genuine concerns are staff who are about to retire and who feel they are not going to lose out by doing so.  There has to be a different approach to ensuring the HSE is getting a true account of the difficulties staff are facing in particular hospitals.  The matter needs to be approached in a different way.  I have heard reports on this matter from three hospitals in different parts of the country.

I can say the following, however: in the six months I have been here, I have been around most of the settings, everywhere from Letterkenny and the west and south-east coasts to the Dublin locations and the midlands.  I have been to hospital, acute, community, social care and section 38 settings.  In those visits, I do not spend my time just with management.  I have a brief 35-minute meeting with management and I spend at least four hours walking around talking to staff.  I generally spend my lunch with a group of staff who decide they want to sit beside me.  I get regular and frequent feedback on the issues from staff.  This has been very valuable for me.  It is the way I operate.  It is a management style I have and it has informed me greatly about some of the challenges we face in tackling some of the pressures in the health system.  I have been very open with staff and I have been very engaged.  From the feedback I have got, I believe staff feel there is now a chance to raise the real issues they are experiencing.  I have spent a significant amount of my time on staff engagement.  I spend at least a day and a half per fortnight out in the settings.  That is how I operate.  The feedback indicates very informally the real issues that arise in the various settings, not just the acute settings but also the community settings.  The Minister was touching on process earlier but the feedback is informing me about a number of issues, the first being how those at the HSE centre really need to consider what they are doing and make sure it is adding value for staff at the front line in services and social care.  As I said my opening statement, that is a process I have commenced already.  We are going to examine what we do in the centre and ask whether it adds value for front-line staff.  If not, we will stop it.  I have very firmly flipped my focus onto our front-line service delivery teams to determine the issues that arise for them and how we need to address them.<\/p> <p>  In our staff satisfaction survey, which was published just last December, there were some very real issues arising over control culture.  People were feeling very motivated in their own jobs but not connected to middle and senior management.  They did not feel they were able to raise issues.  That is something I am very conscious of and that I want to change.  That is why I am spending my time in the acute setting.  I reassure the Senator that I am very happy to tackle or examine any specific issues the Senator has.  My personal style is a leadership style.  I have been in the private sector, the not-for-profit sector, central government, local government and now the HSE.  I can only demonstrate by what I do.  I have outlined what I do.<\/p> <p>  The second issue, that of consultant posts, is a very genuine one.  We are all aware it is not just an Irish issue but that it is also a global one.<\/p><p>We are making progress, but it is slow.  We want to recruit more consultants.  We have more capacity to recruit more consultants and more funding in our plan next year to do so.  We are seeing the beginning of a more positive trend this year.  As I mentioned, year on year we have 142 extra consultants and 135 since January.  The net figure, because we are losing some, is an increase of 90 consultants this year, which is the start of a trend.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Reilly mentioned the time lag.  It is too long.  We are running some pilot projects on doing that more locally and that is probably a better way to progress quickly, but we will work with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in that regard.  We have some numbers by speciality across the country, that is, the number of consultants we have by country, by speciality and by hospital.  We will be happy to provide those to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Can we get details of the number of locums and agency consultants as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#X00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Yes.

First, we must acknowledge the success of using the National Treatment Purchase Fund to cut waiting lists for various procedures, as there has been a considerable drop in the number of people on them.  For example, in the case of inpatient or day case procedures the number fell by 20,000 up to November 2019.  That is a major achievement.  There are still two tranches of 20,000 each to go to bring the figure down to zero, which should be our aim.  Do we have the commitment and procedures in place to continue on that line and to reduce the waiting lists to the necessary and desirable extent?  It is no use to say it is at a tolerable level now.  We must continue with it down to the wire, as it were.<\/p> <p>  My second question arises from Deputy O'Reilly's comments on the replacement of consultants.  If a consultant is due to retire, presumably notice is given by the consultant in advance.  Why not adopt a procedure whereby whatever reappointment procedures are required are put in place instantly?  I realise there is an argument that sometimes they are not approved or they could be on a list waiting for approval, but why not appoint them temporarily?  We must get away from the nonsense of this weighted procedure that is so laborious.  There are procurement procedures that must be complied with, but there should be no gaps in the provision of service.  It must be a seamless provision.  There can be no gaps in the entitlement of the public to have a continuous health service.  That should be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that we occasionally come across glitches, as occurred in our local hospital.  I am loath to be parochial but everybody else does it.  Even you, Chairman, have been known to do it from time to time.  There is a rise in political testosterone, on both sides, during the approach to general elections and one must make allowances for that, but that should not distract us from the issue of making a simple intervention that can be very cost effective.  The Minister has seen the issues in our hospital.  Some of them are ongoing and some are periodic.  I am aware that provision is being made at present, but I wish to raise two matters.  First, we need to know whether there are vacant spaces in our hospitals, particularly where patients are in corridors and awaiting treatment and where ambulances are waiting outside the hospital to deliver their patients and cannot do so for obvious reasons.  We must carry out an audit of the spaces that are available or that can be converted as a matter of urgency.  It is not rocket science.  It is very simple.<\/p><p> We must also examine the cost.  In most cases the question to ask is: \"Why are all the waiting spaces, the emergency department and the corridors full?\"  We must find out what is causing the problem.  Is it because there are no doctors or an insufficient number of doctors available?  Is it because an insufficient number of beds are available or insufficient space where beds or trolleys can be put?  Incidentally, there is no reason that a trolley cannot be put in a ward while awaiting transition instead of having patients in the front row at the entrance to the hospital, which is bad for hospital morale and bad and dangerous for patients.  It is bad for the morale of the staff and that is dangerous because there will eventually be stress, which causes other problems, and health and safety issues.  Could an urgent audit be carried out to ascertain the amount of spaces that can be supervised and in which beds or trolleys can be placed, rather than having them in corridors where patients, visitors and staff have to bump into each other?  I have seen cases where blood samples are being taken, people are being fed, patients are being visited, people are getting seriously ill and so forth in those circumstances.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this should be happening.  There is no reason for it to happen if there is covered space in the grounds.  If not, it is quite simple to get temporary accommodation that would meet that requirement.  It is not expensive.  We must look at the things we can do quickly to make it safer, better and more comfortable for patients.<\/p><p> On the issue of child mental health, we have all encountered situations where there are acute cases of autism and behavioural problems.  The patients are in obvious difficulty and their parents are at their wits' end trying to find something that meets their requirements.  I believe it is possible to provide an adequate service.  It is necessary to do so.  One of the things that is urgently required is a number of mental health programmes in-house where the child can be put on a programme that is corrective and has the required amount of supervision over a specified period of time, which is readily recognised.  Could that be done as a matter of urgency?  The mental health sector has always been regarded as the Cinderella, but at some stage we need to recognise that there is a growing problem in that area.  There is no necessity for it.  Two parents called to see me last weekend.  They are desperate to find a way to solve the problem for their child.  The child has a profound disability and sudden, unexpected behavioural breakdowns.  In those circumstances, we should provide the service that is necessary.  It is not massively costly.  It is simple, but we must provide the programme.<\/p><p> I have come to the last issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#X00900","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want to get answers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Y00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Of course, I do.

They bring forward some very good proposals and have been funded.  In most of the emergency departments I have visited we are seeing good, innovative ways to improve patient flows in acute settings.  One of the challenges is to scale up those initiatives and have a level of consistency across all emergency departments.<\/p> <p>  To reassure the Deputy I will give a few examples of what is happening across the acute settings.  There is a very good innovative process with streaming.  Patients who come from GP referrals with adequate information can be referred through the ED and onwards.  That is happening very well in a number of areas.<\/p><p>Somebody mentioned ANPs, advanced nursing practitioners earlier.  The use of ANPs in our emergency departments, EDs, and indeed clinicians and advanced medical assessment units are very successfully moving on patients with specific needs much more quickly.  Triage processes, which can differ in many EDs, have been very successful.  Emergency clinicians in EDs prove very beneficial and help patient flows so that we do not have the congestion that has been seen.  Much of our patient advocacy services specifically in terms of some mental health issues that the Deputy just spoke about on our EDs are working very well for us.<\/p><p> A number of initiatives are taking place.  Our challenge is definitely to use space, on which I am sure we have a very accurate picture across the way, but more importantly to scale up some of those good initiatives which are happening around the place.  What I am seeing is very innovative and something we can scale up and roll out as part of the solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":430,"content":"<p>As part of our improvement programme for our acute hospitals, members of our special delivery unit audit those hospitals.  The issues that arise in EDs are often symptomatic of challenges across the entire site.  It is important for us to look at the totality of the beds.  They go into a hospital on a given day and audit everybody in a bed to see who is in the bed and whether they should be there or if they should be somewhere else.  That work goes on all the time.  They have been focusing on our most challenged sites recently to ensure the best use is made of all the available beds.  I assure members of the committee that that improvement work is constantly ongoing.<\/p> <p>  I might say a word about mental health and children.  We currently have 71 community teams and we have beds.  Interestingly, we hear much about people awaiting mental health beds.  At any one time at the moment we might only have one or two people on a waiting list for an acute mental health bed.  Our challenge relates more to the different needs of different groups of children.  Deputy Durkan mentioned autism.  Where we have children with different types of needs, they are not necessarily appropriate for acute mental health beds.  We are developing an approach focused on in-home intensive support and in-home intensive respite.  That will come with a range of behavioural supports so that children can stay at home and be fully supported with behavioural and other supports.  That will be growing again in 2020.  We are trying to differentiate between children who have different needs and to ensure we are providing the right supports in the right place for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Earlier I said 83 beds of the 190 have been approved.  Running a live tracker here, I now believe it is 107 beds because 25 for Tallaght have now also been approved.  Therefore 107 of the additional 190 we hope to open have now been approved.  If we stay for the day we might get that figure up even further.  It is 107 and we can keep the committee updated as the numbers come in.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Durkan for his initiatives.  We had a very good visit to Naas General Hospital last Thursday night.  We saw a very hard-working management team and staff in a very busy environment.  Thankfully that hospital has had a slight decrease in trolley numbers this year, on which the staff are to be commended.  There has been a decrease in attendances at the ED this year, but a significant increase in attendances of people over the age of 75.  When we were in that ED last week I was struck by the age profile.  Further to Ms O'Connor's point, it raises the broader discussion about the profile of the people ending up in EDs and whether more can be done the help them not end up in them, through doing more in our nursing homes, through more of the statutory home care scheme and through enhanced primary care teams.  That is the message I took away from our visit to Naas General Hospital last week.<\/p> <p>  The endoscopy unit needs to go to tender in early 2020, which is the intention.  That will greatly increase the capacity for scopes.  The very dedicated clinicians there have long been promised this.  They were about to get it and then the economy crashed.  That is badly needed.  I was excited to hear that that would give rise to the possibility of building two extra wards which would also provide more capacity.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked how we can get that waiting list to zero.  He very kindly and fairly noted the progress we have made in reducing the number of people waiting for hospital operations.  If we are very honest, we must acknowledge the number will never be zero, as the Deputy knows, because people will always be joining the list.  It is much more important to focus on how long they are waiting.  Many people, who go to see a doctor today and are referred for an operation, would not necessarily want the operation immediately.<\/p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare committee proposed that people should not wait longer than 12 weeks.  When I became Minister, about 32% of people in 2017 were having their hospital operation in 12 weeks or less and that is now up to 42%.  The right question for us all to ask is how we can get that 42% up to 100%.<\/p><p>We have discussed at length some of the ways we can do that.<\/p><p> Ms O'Connor may wish to add to what was said about CAMHS.  Thankfully through the investment we have made in the new assistant psychology posts and the 20 psychology posts in primary care, we have 114 assistant psychologists now working in primary care - certainly funded posts - and we have 20 psychology posts in primary care since last year.  We have seen a 20% reduction in the number of people waiting for child and adolescent mental health services.  If it is the Deputy's child or mine, we need them in straightaway.  Those lists are reducing and we need to build on that further.<\/p><p> One of the reasons for that reduction is that we are widening the range of services we are providing.  Not everybody needs to go through the CAMHS.  For some people an assistant psychologist might work.  On the other end of the spectrum, we will open the Portrane hospital next year.  We need to look at the entire range of mental health services available and not channel everybody through one route.  We need to broaden the capacity through a variety of ways. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#Z00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":433,"content":"<p>We are also working closely with schools to try to support children in the environments they should be in.

In the past couple of weeks one of the four got on to a programme which was necessary.  In one case the child severely injured themselves and was referred to an accident and emergency department.  They had to wait all day in the accident and emergency department from 8 a.m. until night and had to come in the following morning again.  This is where we need to marry up the services.  It should have been possible for somebody somehow somewhere to identify the child as an urgent case.  The child, who had suffered a really serious injury, should have been taken out of the queue and put somewhere else to be dealt with.

Methadone has been in our communities for many years, providing help for people with addiction problems to live their lives.  Many people have been on methadone for some time and want to stay on it.  Sometimes it is sometimes difficult to change people's attitude to moving from one service to another.  Methadone helps them to achieve their daily tasks.  Another drug, Suboxone, can be used instead of methadone but it is not for everybody because people with other medical issues cannot take it.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question on what are we doing about the drug services in our communities, we have the national strategy of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  We work on the ground with the HSE, statutory agencies and other bodies to bring people with addiction problems through recovery and support and, above all, deal with their families.  The stigma of addiction is still alive and well in our communities and we are trying to tackle that and create a health-led approach to the national drugs strategy.  It is about reducing the harm and helping people who have been on methadone for a long time to have a different focus in their lives.<\/p> <p>  Methadone will continue to be very much a part of the service that is provided for people who are in addiction but services will also be provided by level 1 and level 2 GPs.  Considerable work is being done with people in programmes on a daily basis, trying to facilitate them to go forward and live normal lives.  I meet and speak with many people who are on methadone and it is like a long-term illness for them because they need a certain amount of methadone to continue to function.  Level 1 and level 2 GPs and pharmacists are doing their best to help people with their doses and the prescription of methadone will continue for some time.  It is not the be-all and end-all of drug treatment but it is a means by which people can be looked after on maintenance programmes.  That is what is happening.<\/p> <p>  That is why it is so important that the national drugs strategy is seen as a health-led document, rather than a criminal justice document, and people who have specific illnesses relating to their addiction to alcohol and drugs are guided through the services in their communities.  The HSE and some of the primary care service centres across the country provide methadone clinics and needle exchange clinics.  People are visiting these centres on a daily basis.  They are not separated, they go in the same door as other patients and participate in the healthcare system.  One of the biggest problems is the stigma relating to addiction and to the families of addicts.  People who are trapped in addiction experience that stigma every day, particularly when they are living in communities where their families can also be targeted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#BB00200","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I will come back in again shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#BB00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":444,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#BB00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I will comment on CAMHS.

That set out a range of actions in respect of CAMHS initiatives that were to be put in place and those actions still hold true.  Many of them have been done but more need to be invested in.  One of those actions that was launched recently was a helpline to support young adults at points of distress in their lives.

A significant proportion of people who attend emergency departments are members of our aged population.  These people have chronic illnesses and multiple illnesses.  This is not a criticism because people are not attending emergency departments when they should not be.  We must create new routes for their treatment.  We need more GPs.  I have met people from the training college to discuss the matter and it is positive that is looks as if more GPs are coming on stream.  We need to invest in that and that is a part of our Sl&aacute;intecare solution.  Pharmacies can play a much better role in the context of treatment and care in the future.  The contract for pharmacists will be negotiated next year and that will give us an opportunity to look at what levels of care can take place in a pharmacy setting.  The first thing we need to do is to reduce the entry points into acute settings.<\/p> <p>  I listed a number of good, innovative triage processes, including advanced medical assessment units, having emergency department consultants in the emergency department all the time and having GPs in the emergency department.  There is really good innovation and the challenge is to scale that up across the country.  It is an issue of capacity in hospitals and the Minister has outlined some relief that will be part of the solution.  We also need more egress points, as the Minister touched on, which means more community and step-down beds and more investment in nursing home support schemes, which we will have in 2020 when we launch the service plan.<\/p> <p>  We would be misleading the public if we were to say that we will make matters better in a few weeks or months by doing this or that.   We have a key performance indicator in respect of trolleys.  I have worked in capacity and workflow management all my career and we have what is called a lag indicator which looks at the measure at the end of a congestion point.  We must develop a way of looking at our setting that looks at the whole workflow management process.  That is about entry points and how to reduce pressure on them at capacity, how in-house flow can be improved and the need for more settings for patients who are egressing.  This will not be solved in weeks or months and I did not convince anybody that it would be solved in that timescale when I took this job.  This is a relentless process in which we must invest for the coming years through Sl&aacute;intecare.  We must stick to the plan.  That is the longer-term solution and that is when we will be doing justice to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I do not agree entirely, but I will come back in again later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":449,"content":"<p>Would the Minister like to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I will comment briefly on the issue of drug addiction.  I want to reinforce the point the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, made about stigma.  I spent approximately two hours at a private meeting of families impacted by addiction last night.  It is a weekly addiction family support meeting in Dublin which I was kindly allowed to attend.  The issue of stigma came up over and over again and the fact that we always talk about the addict but not the impacts that addiction has on family members.  One person has an addiction and the ripple effect means that it affects nine to a dozen others.  The Minister of State and I will look at how we can put in place better supports for the families of people with addiction in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  There is another element of stigma that I heard about at the meeting last night and at a number of recent meetings.  We are trying to open a supervised injection facility in the centre of Dublin because there is so much evidence that it works but, sadly, some politicians from across the political spectrum are objecting to that and engaging in NIMBYism.  This process was started by the then Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and has been championed by the Minister of State, but, sadly, others are delivering literature, tweeting and adding to the stigma for the sake of trying to get a few cheap votes locally.  I echo the calls that have been made to end the stigma and shame on those politicians who are involved in NIMBYism.  They should come along to the briefings at this committee, meet people with addiction and their families, know what they are talking about and should know better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#CC00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>We will now bring in Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and I will then offer a break if people wish to take one.

If a hospital manager or a hospital group manager believes that he or she can open capacity, that there is a space in the hospital, that staff can be recruited or that there is a smaller hospital or community down the road where capacity can be opened quickly, then I want to hear it.  I am not interested in people promising to open capacity next July.  If a manager believes that he or she can open up capacity quickly, then the NTPF is working with the HSE to provide the funding.  From talking to the NTPF and the HSE, we estimate that the figure will be approximately 190 beds.  A total of 107 have now been approved.  Applications are still coming in.  When the Deputy goes back to her constituency and to Bantry, she will see that the invitation is there for everyone to apply quickly.

We published the report.  My officials and others, including representatives of the Irish Family Planning Association, came before the committee in recent weeks.  The clear direction of travel here has to be free contraception for every woman in Ireland.  The question for those of us around this table - it is a genuinely bipartisan question - is how we phase it and ensure that there is choice.  My view of the world is that in 2020 we should begin the legislative process with the group most in need.  My reading of the report and my engagement with the Irish Family Planning Association and others suggests that this group is made up of younger woman and women in traditionally vulnerable groups.<\/p> <p>  People mentioned elections.  I genuinely believe that before we go into the general election every party in the House should try to agree on a cross-party basis, as we have done on other contentious issues, that, whoever wins the election, we have a direction of travel.  We should agree that between year X and year Y we are going to travel the journey to free contraception.  It requires legislation.  We can give out free condoms.  We are already doing that.  We have expanded the national condom distribution service this year and vending machines are going in across colleges.  There is a legislative requirement for contraception when going to the doctor and the pharmacy.  We should legislate for the availability of free contraception on a phased basis by the end of 2020 or the start of 2021, but we need to agree the roadmap to get to full coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#DD00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Paediatricians made a statement this morning about the unsuitability of direct provision and the impact on children's lives.

We can only begin to imagine the trauma of that for a child.  It is fair to say all of us are grappling with finding the right solutions from a housing and accommodation point of view.

We have to take, and we are taking, a whole-of-government approach to this.

My Department is putting in health supports as well.  That is important.<\/p><p> We have a major issue that we have to nip in the bud.  It relates to the creeping racism in our political debates around this.  I am not going to get into specific examples but I believe we all need to call it out.

The Department of Justice and Equality is doing an excellent job on behalf of Irish citizens in responding to Ireland's international obligations to take in, support and give c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to people fleeing oppression.

We are now training more GPs than ever and that is good news.<\/p> <p>  The second part is how the hell we ensure they stay GPs and how we keep them in Ireland.  The GP contract is an important part of that.  A doctor can now become a GP in an era that will be post FEMPI, one in which doctors will be better resourced and supported not only financially but in terms of paternity leave, maternity leave, increased rural allowance and a fund for areas of urban deprivation if a doctor is working there.<\/p> <p>  The third point is the immediate issue.  What I have just said is good and important but the third point is the immediate issue.  There are areas today that need a GP tomorrow.  I commend what the HSE is doing in this regard, which is trying to be flexible in terms of how we can do practical things to incentivise a GP to stay in an area.  This may include things like trying to find premises for the GP, integrating the practice into a primary care centre or trying to assist with ancillary staffing.  This are things that make it a little more likely that a GP will agree to go into a given area.  I know the HSE are working on several areas throughout the country.

An issue that was raised was the creation of panels for appointments.<\/p><p>There is a problem in respect of those panels.  I understand that those panels will be concluded next year and that a new panel system will be drawn up.  On that issue, I am aware of a speech and language therapist in a hospital who has been approved to move to a different hospital but cannot because the recruitment process for the position she holds is frozen, not funded, not approved or whatever is the term.  There is an issue in respect of panels and, in particular, the geography associated with panels.  One may be a specialist in the south of Ireland and when a vacancy arises one is offered a position in the North of the country, which is not practical for one to take up.  There seems to be a problem in respect of the constituent parts of panels and the way people are offered jobs from those panels.  The Minister might clarify that when replying.<\/p><p> Deputy Margaret Murphy-O'Mahony raised the issue of GP vacancies.  The particular problem that arises when somebody retires is the way that post is filled.  I want to make a practical suggestion to the Minister.  The panel system for interviewing for GPs is out of date.  The marking system might be out of date also because when somebody retires, it is important to have local information on the way that GP panel is filled.  Having the retired GP who has just vacated the position as part of that panel is important because he or she may well have been head-hunting for somebody to come onto that list before he or she retires and would have a good deal of local knowledge about who would be the most appropriate person to take on the list.  It is often the case that a list is drawn up, the system of offering it to the first, second or third person is gone through and by the time the person who wants the job or could take it is reached, he or she has moved on.  The marking system is disconnected from the practical availability of GPs on the ground because the longer a panel is unfilled, the less chance we have of getting somebody from that existing panel.  The input of the retiring GP or much more local input in the interview process would speed up the filling of that position.<\/p><p> The MRI scanner in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is long overdue but very welcome.  I am disappointed that it will operate only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  The MRI scanner is essential to reducing the number of people waiting for admission to the hospital and confining its use from Monday to Friday does not make the best use of it.  It should operate for longer hours during the week but it also should function at weekends to clear the backlog of MRI scans, not only for patients in casualty but also patients on waiting lists.  Consultants in the mid-west are now advising public patients to get their scans done privately because they will not get them done publicly in a timely manner.  It is important that the Minister should consider the opening hours for that scanner.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid referred earlier to theatres in Ennis hospital.  It is essential that the theatres in the hospital be upgraded.  Two new modular theatres are required to allow inpatient day-care procedures to be carried out.  That would take a lot of pressure off UL and allow ear, nose and throat surgery in particular, about which we have spoken previously, to be developed in Ennis hospital in the way ophthalmology services have been developed in Nenagh.  It would be critical infrastructure to put in place to solve the problems all of us have mentioned earlier in respect of UHL.  The Minister might comment on using our model 2 hospitals to the maximum advantage.<\/p><p> Mr. Reid also mentioned hospital avoidance.  It is critical that we expand our community intervention team, CIT, services to allow frail elderly people remain in their homes.  CIT services are essential for that.  There is an axis between CIT GPs and public health nurses.<\/p><p>If they do not exist within the community, people will end up in accident and emergency services unnecessarily when they could be managed at home.<\/p><p> We mentioned previously that it is essential to expand community diagnostics.  That is one of the pillars of the winter plan for the mid-west but I am not aware how GPs or others access those community diagnostics because information is not available on that.<\/p><p> On the timeline for scheduled care hospitals, site selection will happen next year.  In terms of the process, it will then have to go to design, procurement, tendering, building and commissioning.  What is the timeline for an elective hospital to take in patients?  Is the children's hospital consuming funds that should be going to all of those other services?  The Minister might give us a timeline for that in respect of elective hospitals.<\/p><p> My last question relates to ophthalmology services in the mid-west.  The waiting time from seeing the consultant to having surgery is reduced but the waiting time for an initial visit, even though one may have a diagnosis of a cataract from an optician, needs to be removed.  One presents with the diagnosis.  A diagnosis process is not necessary but getting to that first visit is still taking two to three years in the mid-west.  I accept the time may be shorter after one has been seen but the time between being referred and being seen is still two to three years.  That is my first tranche of questions for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#KK01000","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":512,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.

We need to listen to him on that in terms of his professional experience but also his knowledge in terms of what is happening on the ground in rural parts of Ireland.  We may or may not agree on this but I am clear as to what we need to do about increasing the pipeline in terms of new GPs and trying to keep them in Ireland.  I accept that we need to do more in terms of the contract but as I said earlier, there is an immediacy now in some communities.  We are already seeing on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis communities stepping up after the crisis emerges, meeting with the HSE and asking how this can be fixed.  We are seeing good examples of some of the collaboration taking place.  I saw it in Kerry recently where the community and the HSE locally are working together but only after the vacancy arises.  One of the points the Chairman is making is that there should be greater community involvement at a much earlier stage.  We know that, say, Dr. X is due to retire so we should start that process earlier.<\/p><p>The Chairman's comment on the marking scheme is fair.  There might be an issue in terms of a GP choosing their successor, which is not what he is suggesting, but we need to get the balance right.

We will be looking at increasing the CIT capacity and the community frailty intervention team in the community in the mid-west.

I have never suggested that these are things that can be done today or tomorrow.  They are very much a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a ten-year plan.  I hope that they will be delivered during the first half of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We would have a much better outlook regarding what they will constitute - sites and the like - by the first quarter of next year.<\/p><p> The Chairman's point about inpatient day cases versus outpatients is valid.  It is one we have discussed quite regularly and one that the NTPF, the HSE and the Department are eager to move on in 2020.  Patients do not differentiate between the outpatient and the inpatient nor should they.  If I have a problem with my eye, I need to see a consultant.  When I see the consultant, I might need a cataract operation or whatever.  That is the wait, that is the total time.  The question is whether we can put in place a system that takes someone through the entire process and whether the NTPF can help fund that whole journey, in other words, taking somebody through the outpatient clinic, to having the procedure done and out the other end?  The way we differentiate between outpatients and inpatients is not the way real life works for people.<\/p><p> There are very exciting proposals, with which the Chairman will be familiar, regarding community ophthalmology and a view that a lot more can be done in that context.  In the context of that specialty and half a dozen others to which I referred in my opening statement, we can press \"go\" on a few in 2020.

Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and the Chairman also raised this issue with the Minister of State, who indicated that he is focusing on it.  I wish to highlight the case of families where a child or adult with particular needs relating to Down's syndrome or another condition has been under the care of their parents and the parents have become old and inform or have passed away.  I feel particularly strongly about this because when the parents pass away, the vulnerable individual really has nobody to stand up for him or her apart from Members of this House or other public representatives.  There is a particular case in Mayo involving a young man in his early 30s.  Both his parents are deceased.  My understanding is that Western Care gets a budget allocation and is to provide services in the community.  In this case, it is not delivering the service because the individual is not getting residential care and no budget is available for him.  The net impact is that this young man does not have a stable environment.  People like him want to be under the care of Western Care and live out the rest of their lives in a stable environment.  While I know this is a priority for the Minister of State, can he give me any indication as to when a space for this gentleman, about whom I have been tormenting the Minister of State since last June, will become available?

As I said earlier, there will be a significant increase in resources over the &euro;2 billion figure regarding the HSE service plan.  I want to personalise this in one way because I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the important thing is to focus on the families and the person with a disability.  In 2020, we plan to have 8,358 residential places.  We have 33,700 day respite sessions, 166,00 respite overnights and 23,000 day places so these are the kind of plans that are in place.  One goes back to the core question.  Every year, we have a number of people in those situations.  I am pushing very strongly for the extra money and resources.  I have been talking to the Minister - even over the past few days.  The Minister gets it.  He is very supportive of me.  Do we need more residential places for people in critical need who have no family?  That is the phrase I am using.  The answer is \"Yes\".  I hope to see some of those new residential places come into play in the next couple of weeks.  That is my view at the moment but I do accept that when we are having a debate about budgets and the service plan, when one digs deep, one must pick out priorities.  I accept the Deputy's point about those adults with disabilities whose parents are dead.  Under the UN convention, these people have a right to a service so we must push that.

There is an anomaly within the PCRS.  Any GP providing the service can claim the fees for the termination of pregnancy but that same GP, who is not the person's regular GP, cannot prescribe Implanon or another long-acting reversible form of contraception.  It seems like a missed opportunity when the individual looking for the termination of pregnancy is eligible under the medical card system.  This is not about getting extra eligibility.  It is about someone who is already deemed eligible for medical card services being able to avail of services such as the insertion of Implanon by the GP who carries out the termination of pregnancy in the short period of time - either on the day or a short period of time thereafter.

Regarding methadone, I am delighted to hear that the Minister met with the families of people involving in the methadone scheme or who have had their lives ravaged by addiction.  I am very supportive of the Minister visiting the families.  For many people, particularly in these Houses, it is fine to talk about people in the abstract, be they in a methadone or direct provision centre or any sort of centre, as if they are a different type or sort of person but, as I am sure the Minister saw last night, these are normal people from normal families who walk among us and have just been hit in some unfortunate way and touched by the ravages of drug addiction.  I very much welcome the Minister's visit last night.  Methadone treatment is almost regarded as being negative.  There is a perception that if somebody is on 10 ml of methadone for the rest of his or her life, that is somehow a bad thing.<\/p><p>To my mind, it is a good thing.  If they need a maintenance dose to keep the show on the road and keep their lives in line, it is good to have that relationship with their prescribing doctor and their pharmacist to keep them on the straight and narrow.  I very much welcome this and any additional supports that can be given to families.  I welcome any measures that highlight what they have to deal with in their lives, the impacts on other children in the family and the extended family, and also people's positions in their neighbourhoods and communities.  Stigma has been mentioned this morning.  Families who have been ravaged by drugs often face strong push-back in their communities.  I welcome any moves to support those families.<\/p><p> As was reported yesterday, in recent times there has been a significant increase in the incidence of mumps in our population.  In Samoa, we have also seen a shutdown with the outbreak of measles.  All of this is part of the global dumbing down when it comes to vaccination, fake news, the Wakefield generation coming of age and such.  The net impact of the mumps outbreak is that we are going to have a generation of young men who will have fertility problems when they seek to start families.  Is there any plan to try to highlight this?  I have always thought that the young people who are affected are probably the key.  If a young man discovers that his parents chose not to vaccinate him against mumps when he was a child, and now his future in terms of having children is going to be severely impacted, is there any plan to wake that generation up to the impacts of previous decisions on their healthcare?  In terms of measles, the Minister said some time ago that he was exploring mandatory vaccinations and was seeking the position of the Attorney General.  While I do not agree with mandatory vaccination in a normal setting, it is now high time we addressed this.  We have the situation in Samoa.  The UK has lost its measles-free status, as far as I know.  This issue is encroaching on us and perhaps we should be prepared, if there is a confluence of events that leads to an outbreak here, to protect the population if we had to.  I would be grateful if the Minister could give us his thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#OO00400","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her comments.  After my meeting last night, I am just so conscious of how grateful families impacted by addiction are that she and others raise these issues and that we talk about them here.  They feel they are never talked about.  We do not talk about addiction enough in Ireland but we talk even less about the impact of addiction on the family.  The Deputy is right that the reason we do not do so is that there is a nice, cosy consensus and an ignorant view that this only happens to X type of person or in Y type of place.  That is complete and utter bull.  The phrase I kept thinking of last night is \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"  This could visit any of our homes or communities.  Frankly, it is visiting all of our communities.  A woman told me last night how the first time someone she knew became aware that her son was addicted to drugs was when she was sitting down watching Coronation Street.  There was a knock on the door and she asked her husband to get up and open it and there were two men in balaclavas with baseball bats standing at their hall door looking to recover a drugs debt.  This is a reality for people and we have to start talking about it.  It is a real health crisis, a public health epidemic.  There is a lot of that same ignorant stigma that we have around other social issues and the notion that it only happens to certain types of people.  That is nonsense and we need to call time on it.  In this committee or in a future configuration, we should be doing more on this.  I intend to do a lot more on it.  The UK has a helpline for families affected by addiction.  I want to explore how we can look at this as well.  We need to do a lot more.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of mumps, measles and mandatory vaccination, I know Deputy O'Connell is passionate about the whole area of vaccination.  The current status in terms of my own thought process and policy development is that I am awaiting a report from the Health Research Board, HRB.  I asked it to do a body of work on what could be effective.  I am not interested in a stunt or something that looks like we are doing something.  I want to do something.  I have asked the HRB to look at what other jurisdictions have done that has proven effective in terms of combating vaccine hesitancy.  I am expecting that report any day now and by the end of the year.  I will read it alongside the advice of the Attorney General and come forward with policy proposals.<\/p><p>My view is that there may be issues with the Constitution in the context of education and schools.  People have a constitutional right to a primary education.  How a constitutional rights interacts with a particular issue may present a challenge.  If, however, we are really serious about vaccination, we know that it happens prior to primary school.  It actually happens when children are in cr&egrave;ches and other childcare facilities.<\/p><p> I make a plea to Early Childhood Ireland and others regarding the fact that there is nothing stopping cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers from making it a requirement for parents to show that their children have been vaccinated in order for them to be accepted by those facilities.  This has become the norm in terms of how we deal with our family pets.  It is quite astonishing that it is not the norm when it comes to dealing with children.  If I were to send my child to a cr&egrave;che, I would like to know that not only have I done right by her in terms of getting her vaccinated but that she is going into an environment where she cannot pick up other illness because other people have failed in their duties to protect public health.  All of us should be calling on cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers to make this part of good practice and guidelines from today.  I do not think there is any reason that this should not happen.<\/p><p> In terms of the Deputy's question regarding an effective campaign, I have heard her talk about how we can have an effective campaign for the generation that were not vaccinated - the Wakefield generation, as the Deputy refers to them.  She is dead right.  It is a really important campaign that we could run in colleges, etc.  The Vaccine Alliance is looking at what is effective in terms of public awareness campaigns.  I will certainly feed that back to it.  The final point I want to make on vaccinations is that I had meetings with the social media companies recently.  Social media has been a really great tool but would Brexit have happened, would Donald Trump have been elected, and would the uptake rate relating to the HPV vaccine have dropped so significantly if we did not have social media?  Who knows.  We certainly know that the spread of disinformation and misinformation on social media has contributed significantly to a decrease in vaccination rates, particularly around the HPV vaccine but also in respect of other vaccines.  At the meetings, I was encouraged somewhat that they were doing some things and that they are certainly realising even from a business model point of view that their users expect them to do more.  I am still a little concerned with Google wanting to keep as its \"secret sauce\" information relating to how one becomes the number one hit on a Google search.  When I search the word \"vaccination\" on Google, I do not think it is acceptable that I get anything other than a reputable source of information at the top of the results list.  We have agreed to keep in touch and work with Google.  It has agreed to come in and speak to the Vaccine Alliance.  A lot more work definitely needs to be done in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#PP00200","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Mr. Breslin, Mr. Reid and a few others were present at last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss primary care centres.  I do not want to land the issue on them this morning but, in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare, it is fundamental that we move things out of acute settings and into the primary care setting.  There were 341 primary care centres planned from 2008 onwards.  The matter was reviewed in 2012.  It emerged at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week that no one has reviewed position of the centres in light of Sl&aacute;intecare in order to see if they are fit for purpose in terms of what we want to deliver.  There is no definition of what constitutes a primary care centre or a primary care team.  While I am not completely hung up on that, if we are going to move towards treating defined populations, then, in the context of the connection between acute care and community care, it is imperative that the system that was embarked upon in 2008 is modified and made fit for purpose.  If we are going to add diagnostic centres, we have to ensure that capacity exists among the 341 that are planned.  Obviously, we cannot have 341 diagnostic centres but capacity must be there - dotted around the country - and it must be possible to add things so that we are not going to have to buy sites next to centres or whatever.  When we are doing Sl&aacute;intecare, it is about ensuring that we are not already tying a stone to our leg while we are doing it.  We should be able to do it with the plans that are already there.  We can modify them as we go.  I was a bit concerned last week that it was almost as though the primary care thing was put on a shelf and left there and was operating separately from Sl&aacute;intecare when it is integral to its success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#QQ00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I do not disagree with her sentiment or direction of travel in terms of the role of primary care centres and Sl&aacute;intecare-proofing them.  As we were outlining just last week, of the 340 we have 127 in place, there is another 77 in progress and 30 are committed in our capital plan.  What we want to do now is exactly as the Deputy outlined.<\/p><p>We are now looking forward to a new way of treatment and care to which there are various elements, as I touched on earlier.  The first element is GPs, the second is pharmacies, and the third is the primary care centres, both in terms of entry points and egress points.  In my visits to many such centres around the country, I have seen various levels of capability and resourcing.  Centres that have a GP on-site, such as the one I visited last week in Waterford, are very successful.  Young children and those seeking paediatric services come in to them as well, which takes huge pressure off the acute settings.  The centres are very successful when they have the skills and resources in place.  There are other that are fine centres but which do not have the skills, resources, and diagnostics needed to equip them.  As we look forward to Sl&aacute;intecare and talk about new pathways, I am very committed that the investment in the next 77 centres and the infrastructure of the current 127 must be Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed.  In terms of the existing centres, the first element is the &euro;10 million investment committed to in our service plan, as part of the budget, which will rise to &euro;60 million.  That will give us the capacity for 1,000 extra resources on the community side, of which a significant proportion must be in our primary care centres. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#QQ00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>There are five non-members here, who I will group in the interests of time.

I have two quick questions.  I welcome the fact that the HSE is providing funding for 15 beds to be opened at St. John's hospital in Limerick.  However, I have learned from my own inquiries made on Monday that those 15 beds have not been in use for the last three months.  At the same time, there is continuous and severe overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick.  By all means, we should push for the new MRI scanner there, because it would be fantastic.  Why were those 15 beds not put into use three months ago, when there is such a big crisis in Limerick on a continual basis?<\/p> <p>  The building of the 60-bed block is under way, and the 90-bed block will be going in for planning permission shortly.  What measures is the HSE taking, at both national and local level, to ensure all existing bed capacity is being used?  What is being done to ensure all the beds in University Hospital Limerick, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom hospitals are being used on an ongoing basis?  I was shocked to hear that 15 of the 89 beds in St. John's have been out of use for the last three months.  That is unforgivable and unacceptable.  It was a breaking point and a red line for me.  The Government is willing to give whatever resources are required, so I need an answer to these questions.  When did the witnesses first know about the 15 beds and why were they not brought into use three months ago?  What is being done to manage the beds in the five hospitals in the group, namely, UHL, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom?  I was at a mass in a village in east Limerick on Sunday, where nursing homes were advertising that they have spare capacity.  Is due diligence is being done to ensure available nursing home beds and step-down facilities are being used?  I am looking for solutions here.  Deputy Kelly noted that we are all looking for solutions, and we must use the existing resources to the maximum.

The primary focus is the treatment of patients elsewhere in the community.  The question is how quickly we can make that happen.  I welcome Mr. Reid's inclusion of a bigger input from the pharmacy community, with which I agree.  I take this opportunity to recognise that the proposed cuts to pharmacy funding are no longer going ahead, for which I thank the Minister and acknowledge his work in the area.  I would add the use of electronic records in emergency departments to fast-track patients, monitor waiting times etc. to Mr. Reid's synopsis.<\/p><p>Our health budget of over &euro;17 billion is up there among developed countries, as it is a high spend <i>per capita<\/i>.  Based on his six months in the job, does Mr. Reid think it possible to start getting value for the money we are spending?  Cataract operations are still being carried out in the North of Ireland on a regular basis, for example.  Buses go up there from Kerry and Cork.  I send patients up there on public transport and they are seen within a number of weeks.  Yet, every time I submit a query to the HSE about a cataract operation for a constituent, I receive the standard reply that the waiting list is 18 to 24 months.  Surely there is a better way of doing this.  We give that money back to these patients, so it is coming out of the same pot.  It is quicker and more convenient for a patient in the far south of Ireland to travel up to Belfast to get a cataract procedure done.  I cannot see any reason why the system in this country cannot deal with that.<\/p><p>Mr. Reid also spoke about delayed discharges-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#SS00100","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Time, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#SS00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I am nearly done.

My analysis is definitely in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have not invented anything different.  However, I have seen a significant amount of innovation all across our acute and community settings.  While Sl&aacute;intecare is a new direction in terms of pathways to care and devolved regions, we can also scale up and roll out much of what is good in our hospital and community settings.  I have seen a significant amount of that in terms of emergency departments, process flow, oversight of bed capacity within a unit, electronic monitoring of beds and centrally managed hubs.  We can scale up and roll out much of that innovation, on top of the direction of flight of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p><p>We have to scale up better pathways for treatment.  That requires more GPs, more primary care investment and more utilisation of pharmacies.  I agree about electronic solutions.  Electronic health records will take time and investment.  We know it works where we have put it in place.  There is a shorter pathway we can take, which is to have a shared record of patients' care between the GP and the acute setting the Chairman has been talking about quite a bit.  That is an incremental step that we can take in advance of the major investment in the electronic health records.<br\/><br\/>On budget spend, outcomes and related issues, an OECD report was published in the past couple of weeks.  It is quite good and has a synopsis of this.  It demonstrates that health expenditure is above the EU <i>per capita<\/i>average.  Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost six years since 2000.  The report also states that our general public healthcare is comparable with other OECD countries.  It highlights some particular issues that we have with obesity and alcohol, and the demands that places on our services.  It is a good report and I recommend browsing it.  We have a high standard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#SS00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>There is a significant difference between being alive and living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#TT00200","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Sure.  On wider issues, I made a point earlier about the investment that we have made.  We have an extra &euro;1 billion in health expenditure this year compared to last year, an increase of 6.3%.  From what I have seen, investment in the areas we have spoken about is key, as is investing in a different way for the future.  We are finalising next year's service plan at the minute and it will start to make that step.  As the Deputy will be aware, the way that we can relieve the pressure on acute settings is by investment in community settings.  Our service plan for next year starts to make that shift in an incremental way, which is valuable.  There is a challenge for us, as I said in our opening statement, about how we manage with the funds that we have in an effective manner to make the right decisions and investments, and to hold local management to account.  It has to be about safety, improving access and managing within a budget.  Those are three relative challenges that have to be run in parallel, though they are not always conflicting.<\/p> <p>  I made the point in my opening statement that we have done the State some good this year with our oversight of the health spend.  The overrun will be less than half that of last year.  The overrun last year was &euro;650 million plus a &euro;150 million first charge for the following year.  It will be significantly less than half of that by the outturn this year.  That has largely been through the discipline of working with line managers, holding people to account and making sure that we are recruiting in the right places.  I know recruitment has been difficult for everybody.  We have to make sure we are recruiting where we have a budget and that we are recruiting skills that add to service delivery.  The point I made earlier is that we are looking at the centre of the HSE to see what size it should be in the future.  I believe it should be scaled down and that we should devolve more of what we have in the HSE centre to the regions to some hospital acute settings and community settings.  We have to look at it very differently.  That is about management of finances.<\/p> <p>  With regard to lay discharges, I spent some time in Kerry in a hospital in an acute setting and in a community setting.  I was a little frustrated on the day I was there when it was highlighted that there were some beds available in the community and we had delayed discharges in our community setting.  We immediately convened a meeting that evening with the relevant CHO and the hospital manager.  The CHO has worked to increase capacity through a number of initiatives that it has put in place since.  Some beds were available in Killarney at the time and some of those are being utilised.  Some of that is now built into our winter action teams.  Kerry has a good interface and integration between community and acute settings.  A number of initiatives in community settings are giving relief to acute settings.  While they have a challenge in delayed discharges, they had some good initiatives working in a way that we want them to in the future.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#TT00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a specific question on St. John's hospital and why 15 beds are vacant.

At national level, we look at all of the beds in order that we know how many beds are closed or blocked daily, primarily due to infection.  We know that yesterday, across the national system, 111 beds were closed.  We also look at the daily availability of beds in community settings.  The approach through winter is a key focus for us, to make sure that people are stepping out of the acute settings altogether and moving into relevant step-down facilities and transitional care.  At this time, nobody is waiting for transitional care approval.  We are trying to match patients from acute settings to community settings and to ensure that people who are ready to move can move.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Brassil's question about delayed transfer of care, we are doing a great deal of work on that.  Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, commissioned an independent review on delayed transfers of care.  We have been looking at how we record people who are ready to leave acute settings, etc.  Since we started to implement our winter initiative in September, one of the key measures that we have looked at is bed days lost.  We will always have people in beds but how long they are there for is our challenge.  We have reduced the bed days lost by 20% since September on foot of the initiatives we have put in place.  We are proactively trying every day to move people who have been waiting the longest from acute hospitals into more appropriate settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#UU02400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, and Mr. Reid and his team.  I want to raise a number of issues and I will focus on Limerick.  The last time I was here, I mentioned that the blood clinic in UHL closes at 12 noon on a Friday and it needs to be open longer.  It is stopping people from being discharged or some end up being sent to the hospital because there is nobody to read their blood count.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the beds at St. John's, while I welcome the announcement this morning, when I inquired two weeks ago and brought it to the Minister's attention, my understanding was there were 20 beds at that stage.  I want to know if five beds have disappeared since that time.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the centre that was opened last Wednesday by the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on behalf of the Minister.  Mr. Reid referred to new ways of doing things in regard to the discharge of patients.  There is a proposal in the capital plan for 120 replacement beds at St. John's hospital.  If that was brought forward, it would certainly help to free up the beds in the hospital so procedures could be carried out.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, regarding respite.  He has a fund for respite homes.  St. Gabriel's School and Centre in Limerick has a six-bedroom respite unit ready to go and the HSE released funding recently for a staff member to manage the facility.  However, funding to get the rest of the respite centre open is what is necessary.  I have spoken to the Minister about it.  Will he visit the facility the next time he is in Limerick?  It would certainly help young people with disabilities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#VV00100","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":571,"content":"<p>My question relates to Valproate.  Does the Minister have the Valproate response project report on his desk?  Has he been in contact with OACS Ireland and Epilepsy Ireland about this?  I asked him before about a public inquiry into this.  Is he still open to an independent inquiry or investigation into the prescribing of Valproate, given the teratogenic effects of it were widely known, even back to the 1970s, as well as the increased risk of foetal anticonvulsant syndrome around it.  I am asking about an inquiry into who knew what when, and why it continued to be prescribed when there was so much evidence worldwide on the impact it might have.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, in regard to the transition period - I do not want to say handover period - for service users going from Western Care to Praxis Care.  What is the protocol around the transition period?  I have concerns around this.  How do we ensure the organisations to which we are signing over the budget have the capacity, and have done their recruitment and everything else, to have the services and supports in place?  The Minister of State knows that, for the condition of autism, routine and familiarity are so important.  I am concerned that new teams are going in and there is no transition period, so there is no time for the service user to get used to the new practices or that can be done in a way that is streamlined. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#VV00300","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I have a question for the Minister.  I noted his statement on the RCOG report.<\/p><p>I have ideological issues with the way CervicalCheck has been outsourced.  I acknowledge that but I also acknowledge that the Minister needs and wants, and I accept that women must have, confidence in CervicalCheck, that it has to be used, that it is a good thing and that it saves lives.  I want to get that out of the way, and I am not confused about it at all.<br\/><br\/>I am, however, very confused about one aspect of the RCOG report.  The NHS screening programme guidance for applying duty of candour in disclosing results, on page 6, states: &quot;... sometimes it can be hard for screening services to know how to distinguish between a false negative\/false positive that has occurred because of the limitations of screening and a false negative\/false positive that has occurred because <i>something has gone wrong<\/i>&quot;.  I am curious as to why that &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; has not tweaked the Minister's interest in investigating what went wrong in the labs.  Consistently, in the highlighted court cases that we know of involving women who are still alive and women who have died, they successfully sued the laboratories and have been paid big sums, not out of the goodness of the hearts of those laboratories, but because &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; and, clearly, they are acknowledging that when they pay out vast sums.  I want to know why the Minister is not curious that &quot;something has gone wrong&quot;, and why we are not examining what went wrong in those labs.<br\/><br\/>I will give a quick analogy.  If there was an accident at Dublin Airport and five or six people were killed, would we investigate the causes and what might have gone wrong, or would we say that those deaths are within the statistical norms of aviation globally, Dublin Airport is working to appropriate health and safety standards, so why would we bother investigating what went wrong?  I would like an answer from the Minister as to why he is not interested in investigating what went wrong in those labs.  It is connected with my consistent appeal for the figures in regard to which labs the 221+ women's smear tests were carried out in.  I am curious as to why that does not bother the Minister.  He is comparing the results of the RCOG report for Ireland with the results for the NHS.  However, the NHS has acknowledged that sometimes things go wrong but we do not seem to acknowledge or own up to it.<br\/><br\/>I believe the Minister is going to reopen the audit, which has been closed for a year and a half.  In that year and half, some women have had serious results.  The best friend of my secretary, who works in Leinster House, is dying from cervical cancer.  She was under constant screening because she had a procedure in 2009.  The woman, her community and her friends have had to fundraise to have the audit carried out privately and it has cost thousands of euro.  It has shown that, in four previous years, the screening had serious, discordant results that were not picked up and then, all of a sudden, she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  What can the Minister do for women who are caught between the date the audit closed and when it is going to reopen.  When will it reopen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#VV00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I apologise but I have to attend a vote in the Seanad.

With regard to the protocols for transition to get new teenagers going, a lot of preparation is done before 18 year olds move into adult services.  Approximately 1,600 people, having hit 18, come into adult services every year.  The good news is that we managed to secure an extra &euro;13 million to develop these services and to keep them safe.  Every 18 year old that comes out of youth services is now guaranteed a place at an adult day service.  That is essential.  There has to be preparation for that transition.  Most sensible services provide that a few months before people move on to a new service.  Many services provide key workers, link workers and meetings with families and parents.  If members have any concerns about a particular service, they should not hesitate to contact me because we have to ensure that transitions are as stable as possible for people, and particularly for adults with autism, as these transitions can be very difficult for them and for their families.  The 1,600 who come out every year generally do get a place and get on with it.

The Senator is quite correct in saying that there has been knowledge about valproate for many years.  This knowledge was heightened, as it were, in February 2018 when the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions.  Following that, we instituted a communications and support programme to increase awareness among women of childbearing age.  Through working with OACS Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, and a support team we established, we identified 40 families who may have been affected by valproate.  Through that we developed a diagnostic pathway in Crumlin hospital, again working with the agencies I mentioned and members of OACS Ireland, including a consultant geneticist and paediatrician.  Following on from that pathway, some of these patients and their families will require supports.  We are committed to providing those supports.  The Senator is, however, absolutely correct.  There has been knowledge about anticonvulsants in pregnancy for many years.  It is also true that the degree of the knowledge and the strength of the evidence has become more powerful over time.  Our response has, therefore, become more powerful over time.  From her own work, the Senator will know that people have been alerted to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy.  As part of this work, we are introducing nurse practitioners to work in the area of women in pregnancy who are on anticonvulsants, in recognition of the greater risk presented by these drugs, even beyond valproate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#XX00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I believe the Senator asked about a report.

On top of that, we now have the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists answering the question as to whether the programme working effectively.

Dr. Henry may wish to add to my response.  I know a number of groups are doing work on interval cancers, following Dr. Scally's recommendations.  Audit is a really good thing.  This debacle arose from an audit that was intended to disclose but never did, thereby causing people a lot of pain and hurt.  It is really important that we get audit right.  That is a key recommendation made by Dr. Scally.  Deputy Kelly has made a point vociferously several times and I believe Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is making a similar point.  They are asking about the people affected today.  There is no audit ongoing.  When the audits recommence, will these people be covered?  I cannot pre-empt the expert group review but my view is that these people absolutely have to be covered.  Dr. Henry may also have a view.  There cannot be a gap in my view but, obviously, I want to follow the expert group's recommendations.  Dr. Henry may have information to offer the committee in that regard.

As we know from the laboratory report provided here, the number of false negatives is very small in the context of the overall workload of the laboratory.  It is therefore very difficult to draw conclusions.  There are other measures which are equally, if not more, important such as the number of false positives.  These can cause much distress and unnecessary interventions and, in some cases, invasive surgery.  Another measure is the number of high-grade findings.  Because of the huge numbers in each laboratory, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the report.<\/p><p>One other point worth making is on the timeline of the cervical cancer screening programme which started in 2008.  One would have expected a higher degree of findings at the beginning of the programme because no screening programme had existed beforehand.  There are a number of confounders when one tries to examine the relative performance of false negatives in each laboratory, for example, the timing of the laboratory for the programme and the demographics, that is, the population that that laboratory will serve.  <\/p><p> On interval cancer, I acknowledge that Deputy Kelly showed an interest in this matter in previous hearings.  There cannot be any gap in this regard and we recognise the position of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on an interval cancer audit.  It is worth reminding people that the core purpose of interval cancer audit, in fact any audit, is learning and improvement.  Interval cancer audit tied to the duty of candour, as prevails in England and Wales, mean that the results of false negatives would be communicated to everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#YY02300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":618,"content":"<p>This is not just interval cancer audit but full audit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I am not getting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Deputy Smith, but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#ZZ00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>There have been many interruptions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#ZZ00500","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Representatives of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists will be before the committee next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#ZZ00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.

I am sure the Deputy will stand with me when I table proposals shortly to pay consultants much more money.  In return, however, consultants will be expected to work in the public health service.  It will also be expected that public beds will used for public practice and public patients, as in the case that was so well articulated by the Deputy earlier.  It may make the Deputy politically uncomfortable but on this issue, I believe the gap or difference between us is smaller than on many other issues.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has not yet made its position clear on this issue, whereas the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael have.  We believe consultants should be paid much more but if they want to do private practice, they should do it in private hospitals, not in our public hospitals.  We will have to pay them much more to do that.  <\/p> <p>  There is no free money here.  Nurses and midwives did not get any free money.

I am sure Ms &Eacute;ilish Hardiman, the chief executive officer of Children's Health Ireland, who is responsible for this facility, can brief the committee on this matter.  The Tallaght urgent care centre is due to open towards the end of next year.  We will have tabled significant proposals long in advance of that offering consultants much more money to work in the public health service and I emphasis the public aspect of the health service.  I need to make this point, because one will not hear it anywhere else.  Throughout the 2000s - the years of economic boom - there were approximately 7,000 doctors working in the Irish public health service.  There are now more than 10,000 doctors in the health service.

It is insane and multiple hospitals are involved as well as the public-private issue.  It was meant to be investigated but I never received an answer.  <\/p><p> On 5 December at 2.25 p.m. a letter issued from the HSE stating that all the people in the RCOG review were not getting the &euro;2,000.  I welcome what the Minister and the Taoiseach have done today but the fact is that the people around the Minister here, representing the HSE, wrote to the 221+ group and told them they would not get it.  There is no joined-up thinking.  The Minister might reflect on that.  Why did that happen?   <\/p><p> I refer to the Bernadette Kiely case, and I mention her name only because it is public, in the context of non-disclosure and the issues surrounding that.

Surely they should have been concordant and discordant, and a small number should have said there was something missing and a decision could not be made.  That would have been logical.  I refer to those who have serious concerns about the credibility of the review.  I was not filled with encouragement last week when the college was unable to answer some basic questions.  A small number of these women would like an independent assessment of their files.  I am sure that will happen anyway, but unlike the now-resolved matter of the &euro;2,000, can we please just deal with this now and give a positive answer to the question?  I do not think there is a large number of women in this category who would voluntarily want to go down this route but there is a significant number.  For the cost involved, the Minister should just do so.  I ask that he consider that.          <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#AAA01300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I will ask Dr. Henry to comment on some of the RCOG matters.

In putting together this particular programme, we had to bear in mind that we did not want to alarm people who might, for example, have unstable epilepsy.  We did not want them to stop taking their medications abruptly which could cause greater harm.  The whole thrust of the programme was to ensure that they got the best and most expert advice, balancing the risks of changing or coming off medication against staying on medication which might harm a developing foetus.  The bigger question to the Deputy refers is access to specialist care and advice.  I presume she is not just interested in valproate but in other anticonvulsant drugs.  Working with the epilepsy programme, led by Dr. Colin Doherty, we are developing a specific programme.  We have now appointed two out of a planned six specialist nurses for pregnant women who are on anticonvulsant medication so that we can target them early with primary care and afford them the best advice.  We want to ensure that their epilepsy remains stable because abrupt withdrawal can be quite harmful.  We also want to make sure that they are on the safest possible medication at the safest dose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019121100002#DDD01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I would see a role for community pharmacists here because they are the people who generally sell the folic acid and pregnancy tests and who also dispense medication to patients with long-term illnesses.

What is commonly lost in the chat about valproate is the issue of balance, as just described by Dr. Henry.  The risk to the woman and to the pregnancy of abruptly stopping medication must be weighed up.  If a woman with an unplanned pregnancy who is on valproate turns up at a doctor's surgery, she should be told that just stopping is not the solution.  That point is often lost in the argument.<\/p><p> On the RCOG report, Deputy Kelly stated that he is not filled with encouragement.

There have been constant calls for a reopening of the audit process.  To my mind, this all went wrong with the audit.  Somebody decided to conduct an audit without considering how to deal with the results and with the fact that real people were involved, either deceased women's families or women who had adverse outcomes.  Consideration was not given to the results, the impact of same or the issue of open disclosure, and all of that fed into this crisis for people.  It is important that there is some balance here.

The Minister of State will say a few words later about his area of responsibility.<\/p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate being presented is technical in its nature as it does not seek any additional allocation from the Exchequer.  The Estimate is seeking to redistribute some &euro;15.289 million in savings to support particular priorities regarding several of the Department&rsquo;s enterprise, innovation and regulation programmes.<\/p> <p>  The Estimate seeks to provide an additional &euro;500,000 in capital funding to InterTradeIreland to support its Brexit activities, in particular its programme of voucher supports.  Demand for InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit planning vouchers and its Brexit implementation vouchers supports has remained high throughout 2019.  It spiked in advance of the two Brexit deadlines in March and in October.  Almost 1,800 of these vouchers have been approved by InterTradeIreland.  The additional &euro;500,000 being provided through the Supplementary Estimate, which builds upon additional funding provided in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, will be targeted at meeting the increasing demands for InterTradeIerland&rsquo;s services for the remainder of 2019.<\/p> <p>  The INTERREG programme is one of 60 cross-border funding programmes throughout the EU.  The current round of INTERREG, which runs from 2016 to 2022, is jointly funded by the Department and our Northern Ireland counterparts, the Department for the Economy, on a 30:70 basis.  The Department&rsquo;s overall commitment under this round of the programme is &euro;21 million.  The additional &euro;1.2 million being provided to the INTERREG programme in the Supplementary Estimate will increase the overall provision to the programme to &euro;4.2 million in 2019.  For several reasons, the drawdown in the initial years of this round of the programme was much less than anticipated.  The &euro;1.2 million being provided through the Supplementary Estimate is required to ensure that the Department meets its overall funding commitment within the lifetime of this round of the programme.<\/p> <p>  The future growth loan scheme, which was launched in April of this year, provides long-term financing support to Irish businesses to help them strategically invest in a post-Brexit environment.  The scheme operates alongside the Brexit loan scheme, which provides shorter term working capital to businesses that have been impacted by Brexit.  In the period since the launch of the scheme in April 2019, some 2,000 applications have been approved by the scheme&rsquo;s administrators, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The uptake in the scheme has increased significantly in recent months and the additional &euro;2 million being provided through the Supplementary Estimate will ensure that the SBCI can continue, in conjunction with the participating lenders, to meet this increased level of demand.<\/p> <p>  The humanitarian relief scheme is intended to provide humanitarian support for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies that experience flood damage to their premises as a consequence of a severe weather event and have been refused flood insurance.  The &euro;59,000 being sought through the Supplementary Estimate arises from claims relating to flood damage suffered in County Donegal in the aftermath of Storm Lorenzo in October 2019.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will set out the details of the various innovation programmes receiving additional funding through the Supplementary Estimate in his statement later.  Of the total of &euro;11.279 million in additional innovation supports being provided through the Supplementary Estimate, &euro;2.55 million will be provided to the science and technology development programme, &euro;1.999 million to the programme for research in third level institutions and &euro;6.73 million to subscriptions to international organisations.<\/p> <p>  The remaining element of the Estimate involves the provision of an additional &euro;251,000 to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  While the board is essentially self-funded, the Department provides funding to the board in respect of pension payments.  The additional &euro;251,000 being provided to subhead C9 through the Supplementary Estimate reflects the costs of unexpected retirements by members of staff of the board in 2019.<\/p><p> The savings funding our 2019 Supplementary Estimate have been generated in the following programmes: administration pay savings of &euro;448,000; agency legacy pensions savings of &euro;500,000; IDA Ireland savings of &euro;2.1 million; Enterprise Ireland savings of &euro;8 million; workplace relations programme savings of &euro;1.115 million; Health and Safety Authority savings of &euro;375,000; Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement savings of &euro;1.4 million; Competition and Consumer Protection Commission savings of &euro;500,000; and Companies Registration Office savings of &euro;850,000.  The briefing provided by my officials to the committee's secretariat sets out the details of the circumstances giving rise to the savings in each of the aforementioned subheads.  I am happy to discuss these further with the members of the committee.  The committee will see, however, that more than 60% of the savings have been generated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, which account for &euro;8 million and &euro;2.1 million, respectively, of the savings.<\/p><p> Regarding the IDA, the savings of &euro;2.1 million essentially arise in respect of its property programme.  Large-scale capital investment in land and property such as that engaged in by the IDA is a complex and lengthy process.  The inherently complex nature of property and land development transactions, which involve acquisition, engagement with stakeholders, including local authorities, complicated commercial arrangements and building contracts, can, and often does, involve delays.  Nevertheless, regional development remains a top priority for the IDA.  In this regard construction of advance buildings in Dundalk and Galway is almost completed.  The construction of buildings in Carlow and Athlone will begin in 2020.<\/p><p> Regarding savings in Enterprise Ireland, the committee will be aware that in addition to the funding it receives from the Exchequer, Enterprise Ireland generates income from equity investments that it makes in the companies it supports.  Enterprise Ireland is permitted, subject to the approval and sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to retain and use own-resource income, ORI, in support of enterprise development.  Enterprise Ireland has succeeded in generating a significant surfeit of ORI in excess of the amount sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the course of 2019.  Under public expenditure rules, Enterprise Ireland is required to expend ORI before drawing down Exchequer funds.  Accordingly, the additional ORI generated by EI essentially means it will not need to call on its full 2019 Exchequer capital allocation of &euro;65.75 million under subhead A7 of the Department's Vote, thus generating a saving on this subhead.<\/p><p> I hope I have given the committee an overview of the various expenditure and savings elements of the technical Supplementary Estimate I have presented to members.  With the Chairman's permission I now ask the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to give some further details of the additional funding being provided to the Department's innovation programmes through the Supplementary Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#B00400","speaker":"1249","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce very briefly the elements of the Supplementary Estimate relating to research and innovation.  Under the Department's proposed allocation, just over &euro;11 million would be apportioned to meet commitments in respect of various research and development programmes of national importance.  This will help us to accelerate delivery against our targets and goals as set out in Innovation 2020.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;5 million Supplementary Estimate funding for the European Space Agency, ESA, will be invested across six technology development programmes to drive Ireland forward as a competitive player in the space sector.  This investment is directly aligned with the new national space strategy for enterprise, which I published earlier this year and which aims to increase public and private investment in the ESA by 50% by 2025 and develop a strong and economically sustainable space-active industry in Ireland.  As I have noted previously in committee and in the D&aacute;il, our investment through the ESA delivers a sevenfold return in terms of its ultimate impact.  It is critical that we increase our ambition in this area.<\/p> <p>  The specific programmes in which we will invest include telecommunications and integrated applications, exploration, transportation and earth observation.  An additional &euro;1.7 million will be paid to the European Southern Observatory as a contribution to our existing membership liabilities, including the joining fees, which are to be paid over a number of years, and Ireland's contribution to the extremely large telescope, ELT.  Membership of the ESO affords Irish astronomers and researchers the opportunity to be part of an international scientific community conducting groundbreaking research in the most advanced facilities.  ESO membership will grow Ireland's skill base in high-tech areas, delivering on the ambitions of Future Jobs Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The proposed allocation of &euro;1.5 million for Tyndall National Institute in Cork will contribute towards upgrading works to accommodate more researchers in the field of cutting-edge ICT.  This funding will enhance Tyndall's ability to support innovation and deliver significant economic benefit in the form of highly skilled jobs, new start-up activity and investment.<\/p> <p>  An additional &euro;1 million is proposed for Science Foundation Ireland for a number of existing commitments that fall due in 2019.  Taken together with increases in its capital funding in 2020, SFI will be able to fund additional research activity through both its research centres and its funding for individual awards.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;2 million for cycle 5 of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, will address existing financial commitments under that programme.  The PRTLI has supported investment in top-class infrastructure and human capital development across Ireland's higher education institutions.  It has been an important programme for creating the foundation on which further investments by SFI and our other funding agencies now build.<\/p> <p>  The evolution of research, development and innovation and its associated investment have been a cornerstone of Ireland's enterprise policy for many years.  In order to become an innovation leader, it is essential Ireland keeps apace with and anticipates developments in the field.  This ambition must be matched by investment in innovation, research and development and reflected in the above funding decisions.  This supplementary allocation of just over &euro;11 million will provide welcome additional funding into our system, support the quality and impact of our scientific capacity, contribute to our job creation and enterprise growth and help us to deliver on our Innovation 2020 targets and commitments as we look to the future.  Again, I welcome the opportunity to give a very brief introduction as to where this &euro;11 million is being invested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#C00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.  I will start with the Minister of State.  He spoke about the &euro;5 million Supplementary Estimate for the European Space Agency and said an additional &euro;1.7 million will be paid to the European Southern Observatory.  As he is aware, research and innovation are vital for the Irish economy, and membership of international research organisations is an important part of increasing our own research output.  Ireland is currently one of only three European countries that does not have any formal agreement with CERN, which I know the Minister of State is very supportive of.  Innovation 2020's vision is for Ireland to be a global innovation leader driving a strong, sustainable economy and a better society.  If Ireland is to deliver on this vision, membership of organisations such as CERN, which are at the forefront of innovation, is critical.  The committee recently did a body of work on CERN and we launched our document in the past month.  I wish to put the following to the Minister of State strongly on behalf of all the joint committee members.  Some of them are not here, and I am probably straying slightly outside the committee's remit, but at the same time it is a great opportunity to put this to the Minister of State.  While concerns have been raised that Ireland may not be in a position to take advantage of all the potential benefits of membership of CERN, the committee believes that joining CERN, even as an associate member, which would initially cost &euro;1.3 million, would create an environment that would encourage Irish researchers and businesses to take maximum advantage of these opportunities.  The committee has made a number of observations and recommends that negotiations start with CERN with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  I hope we will get the opportunity to discuss the Estimates for 2020 next year but I just wanted to put out a marker on behalf of every member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation that we fully support the Department starting negotiations with CERN with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member.  Could I hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this?<\/p><p>Of course the Chairman can.  I acknowledge that CERN is one of the largest international research organisations in the world.  It is a leading research collaboration investigating the fundamental composition of matter.  The Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 that we would initiate discussions with several international research organisations.  Discussions with CERN started in 2016.  As a matter of fact, an Irish delegation visited CERN in 2016 and we met the director general.  The Department has been proactive in advancing Ireland's membership of CERN.  Representatives of CERN met me and departmental officials some months ago.  We continue to keep the position on CERN membership and its cost under review and we continue to contact officials in CERN.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its support because I am a great supporter of joining CERN.  I hope to visit CERN in January to continue further discussions.  I should tell the committee that based on the indications received from CERN the cost of Ireland's full membership, and I believe we should have full membership, at current prices would be approximately &euro;13.6 million annually, which is substantial money.  To become a full member, a country must go through associate membership prior to membership.<\/p><p> We are continuing negotiations with CERN.  It is my view and that of the Department that we should join CERN.  We will continue negotiations with CERN over the coming months.  I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance about CERN.  I hope to have further meetings with the Minister for Finance in the coming months before I go to CERN.  I support the committee.  CERN is a premier international research organisation.  Believe it or not, it is conducting research in 2,000 areas.  I know a good deal about CERN and we should join it.  I fully support the committee.  Unfortunately, I have not given the Chairman a direct answer.  The Minister will have to give that answer.  If the Chairman were to ask whether the Government supports joining CERN, it does and it is in our programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#C00300","speaker":"1220","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>To be quite clear, the committee felt that if we took a baby step first it might be helpful to the Department because there is a lot of money involved.  The committee recommended that negotiations with CERN start immediately with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  The committee then recommended that after three years of associate membership the Department would conduct a cost-benefit analysis and assess whether there is a case to be made for moving towards full membership.  The committee also recommended that efforts should be made to fund the annual fee for associate membership, which we were told is &euro;1.3 million, within the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation Vote.  We felt we were trying to lead the Department towards it.  I know many in the Department are supportive.  We felt we should look at associate membership first and then, after three years, do a cost-benefit analysis to see what benefits we could get from full membership of CERN, and try to find initial funding from within the budget.  We felt we took appropriate steps in this respect.

Importantly, the return from our &euro;18.3 million annual investment in the European Space Agency has been continuously improving, as demonstrated by the value of the contracts in Ireland, which has increased from &euro;13.9 million in 2017 to more than &euro;21 million.  There is no doubt in my mind that whatever investment we make in CERN we would get back.

I know this can be doubled or trebled with the same input.  The members of the joint committee were unanimous on this.  At the launch four weeks ago, 21 academics from every institute of technology and university in Ireland were present and they were excited for the first time.  They have been banging this drum for a long time.

My first question is on subhead A14 and the future growth loan scheme.  The Government is due to carry out a review of the Brexit loan scheme.  As the future growth loan scheme operates alongside this, are there plans to review the future growth loan scheme?  According to figures I obtained in reply to a parliamentary question in mid-November only 25% of the &euro;300 million capital investment Brexit loan scheme for farmers and fishermen had been drawn down, with only 400 loans sanctioned.  What has the review of the Brexit loan scheme thrown up?  Has there been an increase in sanction and drawdown?  Does the Minister feel it is fit for purpose?  Is it easy and accessible enough for those who have need of it?<\/p> <p>  With regard to subhead B5, the programme for research in third level institutions, it is very welcome that we are putting additional resources into third level research, which is a critical part of what our third level institutions do.

Sometimes legal costs do not materialise in a particular year.<\/p> <p>  There are savings of &euro;500,000 with the CCPC, which essentially arise as a result of expenditure on pay being less than estimated, which is mainly due to the significant staff churn in the CCPC.  All these agencies are the same as businesses across the country, in that they are competing for talent.

We are here to support the commission in that in any way we can.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the powers of the CCPC.  It currently has a wide range of investigative powers provided for in the Consumer Protection Acts 2007 to 2014, the Competition Acts 2002 to 2017 and relevant statutory provisions made under those Acts.  It may also investigate suspected breaches of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The powers of the CCPC were increased significantly by both the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012 and the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  For example, there are powers to consider commitments by undertakings to be rules of court and extended elements of the Criminal Justice Act are to apply to serious competition law offences.  Very high penalties already apply to criminal offences under the Competition Acts.  For example, there are fines of up &euro;5 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is the higher, for an undertaking, and up to ten years in prison for a person, or both.<\/p> <p>  The Empowering National Competition Authorities, ECN+, directive is due to be transposed by 4 February 2021, and it will give the CCPC additional enforcement powers, including the introduction of non-criminal fines for breaches of European Union competition law.  It is my intention to transpose the ECN+ directive by means of primary legislation and I am considering further provisions for inclusion, subject to advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  Any additional measures will be reviewed with due regard to the recent recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on regulatory powers and corporate offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#F01000","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":756,"content":"<p>The Minister is acknowledging that she will make changes and increase the CCPC's powers in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019121100002#F01100","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":757,"content":"<p>Yes.

I am the CEO of CLM.  We have two community law centres in Coolock and Limerick and currently assist more than 3,000 people every year through our range of services, which include legal advice and representation, information and education, and mediation and conflict coaching.  It is fitting that CLM has been invited to present our views on the issue of access to justice given our origins.  CLM, originally known as Coolock Community Law Centre, was established in 1975 as the first independent community law centre in Ireland.  It originally served as a prototype of the neighbourhood or community law centre model which could underpin a nationwide civil legal aid scheme, which did not then exist.<\/p> <p>  The community law centre model, under which we operate, has a number of important characteristics.  Our services are free and embedded in the community, making them as accessible as possible.  Many of our information talks and legal advice clinics are delivered on an outreach basis in locations where the community is congregating such as parish halls, public libraries and community organisations.  Local organisations and interest groups are represented on our board and advisory committees to ensure our services are responsive to, and shaped by, the needs of the community.  Second, community education is a critical part of our work.  Access to justice begins long before anyone steps inside the courtroom.  It begins with creating an awareness of rights and the law, and how the law can be used to enforce those rights.  In CLM, we often encounter a lack of awareness of how the law can assist in situations of homelessness or accessing social welfare, issues that are critical to social inclusion as they most affect a person's ability to participate fully in society.  Third, the community is empowered to use the law through our legal advice and representation service.  CLM currently partners with other organisations to provide more than 180 outreach legal advice clinics every year and our legal representation work is focused on areas of law which disproportionately affect those living in disadvantage, such as employment, equality, social welfare, debt, education and housing, all areas which are not covered by the State-funded civil legal aid scheme.  Fourth, CLM campaigns for law reform, and for the safeguarding of rights enshrined in law.  Our priorities for law reform are directly linked to the issues encountered in our clinics.<\/p> <p>  The right of access to justice is accepted as a constitutional principle and a right under the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  Without it, people are unable to have their voice heard, exercise their rights, challenge discrimination or hold decision-makers accountable.  It is a fundamental tenet of a functioning democratic society.  In the absence of access to justice, challenging incorrect decisions or unfair practices by an arm of the State or other body would be more difficult, more distressing or just impossible, especially for vulnerable groups or at vulnerable times.  Access to justice is vital for social inclusion and many of CLM's legal services are focused on areas which are critical to social inclusion, for example, preventing homelessness, assisting with accessing social welfare, education and other services, preventing job loss and challenging discrimination.  Currently, the right of access to justice is being denied to many.  Susan Gogan's research on unmet legal need in Ballymun in 2005 showed that 76% of those with legal problems had sought help but were unable to obtain it.  Further, the community consultation process during the set-up of CLM Limerick in 2012 showed that community organisations rated the availability of legal services in their area as not good or bad and they had limited expertise in the areas themselves.<\/p> <p>  In my presentation, I will briefly address three points: barriers to accessing justice, limitations of civil legal aid and suggestions for reform, and structural barriers within the legal system itself.  Barriers to accessing to justice were first identified by the Pringle report in 1977 and its conclusions were echoed in a report compiled by CLM in 2012, some 35 years later.  These reports acknowledged that the obstacles facing those living in disadvantage, in need of legal services, are not just the cost and include intimidation of the legal world; inaccessibility of legal services; lack of awareness of rights and the law most relevant to disadvantaged communities, including among the legal profession; fear of not being taken seriously or of retaliation if legal action is taken; and time, including waiting times for legal aid and the time it takes for a case to be heard.  Our practical experience is that these factors deter people from accessing legal services and that the best way to break down these barriers is through meaningful community engagement through the community law centre model.<\/p><p>My second point is on the limitations of the civil legal aid scheme.  The effective availability of the services of a lawyer is a crucial element of access to justice.  If someone cannot afford a private lawyer, the right to legal aid is an essential component of his or her right of access to justice.  The Pringle report in 1977, as well as our 2012 community consultation report and Susan Gogan&rsquo;s 2005 report, recommended that a civil legal aid scheme should offer legal representation for all types of civil legal proceedings and should have a legal education and law reform function.  However, the civil legal aid scheme established in 1979 falls far short of these recommendations and as a result fails to adequately provide for access to justice.  This is due to a number of factors, many of which were highlighted at this committee by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, two weeks ago.  Those factors include the statutory limitations of the civil legal aid scheme itself.  There is no logical reason the availability of legal aid should be determined by area of law rather than need, or why tribunals such as the Workplace Relations Commission or the Social Welfare Appeals Office should be excluded from legal aid.  When an individual&rsquo;s job or welfare payments are being threatened, there is potential for significant adverse consequences not just for that person but also for their family.  Another issue is the overly strict means test, which is out of touch with the reality of the cost of living and which results in people on low incomes who cannot afford a solicitor being denied legal aid.  A further factor is the under-resourcing of the Legal Aid Board, resulting in an average waiting time for a first consultation in Dublin of up to 38 weeks and up to 58 weeks in one particular office.  This is simply too long to wait and it can cause issues for those seeking legal remedies with strict time limits, such as a judicial review, which has an effective time limit of three months.  Finally, the current model of legal aid has not adopted a comprehensive approach to the provision of civil legal aid, as there are no links with disadvantaged communities and there is no law reform or public education function.  Members of the committee can find further detail on these factors in the notes section of our submission.<br\/><br\/>The problems and limitations of the Legal Aid Board raise the question of whether the State is complying with its obligations under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 47 of the European charter on fundamental rights and freedoms in cases involving European law.  People of limited means with complex legal issues are unable to obtain legal aid from the State.  That said, it is important to state that despite the limitations and under-resourcing of the service, CLM&rsquo;s experience of working with Legal Aid Board staff and management has always been very positive.  In fact, Mr. John McDaid and Ms Catherine Ryan recently delivered talks as part of CLM&rsquo;s community education programme.<br\/><br\/>My final point relates to structural barriers within the legal system itself.  In addition to the effective availability of the services of a lawyer, a crucial element of access to justice is effective access to the courts themselves.  There are several barriers to accessing the protection of the courts, including the cost of filing fees, the complexity of the language used and the intimidating atmosphere of the courts.  The courts system as a whole is not designed to cater for children or people with particular vulnerabilities or complex needs.  To give an example, we recently represented a man with physical and intellectual disabilities before the District Court.  He had difficulties with communication and comprehension and neither the barristers nor the judge appeared to have any guidance to follow on how to approach questioning him.  His case was significantly hampered as a result.  A further issue in this area is the delay in implementing reforms contained in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  These reforms will help ensure that people whose decision-making capacity is impaired are afforded the fundamental human right of making their own decisions about their personal and financial affairs, as far as is possible.  At the moment, however, the Victorian concept of wardship still applies through the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  As a community law centre, we also encounter obstacles to taking public interest cases such as the absence of a class action mechanism, restrictive rules relating to <i>locus standi <\/i>and fear of costs.  We often meet clients who have made a decision not to take a case to vindicate their rights because of the fear of a significant costs order should they lose the case.  This occurred recently in the case of a woman who had a very strong legal case regarding the discriminatory provisions of the State pension scheme, which raised broader public interest issues.<br\/><br\/>Apart from the changes that need to happen, there is currently a threat to access to justice in the form of the proposed housing and planning and development Bill 2019, which I understand is due to be debated early in the new year.  If enacted, it will increase costs exposure and make it more difficult for ordinary citizens and environmental NGOs to achieve the necessary legal standing to take cases challenging decisions which have an impact on the environment.  Environmental democracy and oversight is protected by EU law and the Aarhus Convention and has never been so important as we grapple with the challenges posed by climate change.<br\/><br\/>We recommend first restructuring the civil legal aid scheme in line with the community law centre model to include a public legal education and law reform function.  In the interim, greater funding security should be ensured for community law centres, such as CLM and Mercy Law Resource Centre, which continue to meet the need arising from the gap in services.  Second, we recommend reviewing the civil legal aid scheme to ensure it is properly resourced and is provided on the basis of need rather than areas of law, and that the financial means test is more inclusive.  Finally, we need to ensure effective access to the courts by examining issues such as accessibility, cost, class actions, and <i>locus standi <\/i>and protective costs orders, while bearing these matters in mind with the proposed housing and planning and development Bill.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by paraphrasing the American attorney Kimberley Motley, who said that the laws are ours; that they belong to us and need to be used.  If people do not know about their rights under the law, do not know how to assert their rights or are unable to do so without legal assistance, then those rights are not being protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rose Wall","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":786,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Wall very much.

We welcome the committee's focus on access to justice and legal costs and we are very glad of the opportunity to address its members.  They have our full statement, which I will draw on to explain the work of the Mercy Law Resource Centre as a community law centre in facilitating access to justice, and to speak to some of the specific questions set out by the committee.<br\/><br\/>Mercy Law Resource Centre, MLRC, was established in 2009 and is an independent law centre and registered charity, providing free legal advice and representation to people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.  We have a vision of a society where each individual lives in dignity and enjoys equal rights, in particular the right to a home, which is fundamental to each human being.  MLRC also envisages a society where each individual enjoys equal access to justice and legal recourse in order to vindicate those rights.  The need for Mercy Law's services far exceeds demand.  The number of people to whom we have provided advice and representation since 2009 has increased year on year, and in 2018 we assisted over 1,300 individuals and families.<br\/><br\/>There is a vital role for access to justice in the housing sphere.  The UN special rapporteur on adequate housing has highlighted this, stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tViolations of the right to housing are as much failures in the administration of justice as they are failures of housing programmes.  If those living in inadequate housing and in homelessness have no access to justice, they are deprived of agency to bring violations to light, to address root causes or ensure appropriate responses.  They are unable to challenge the policy choices and decisions that created the conditions in which they live. <\/blockquote> <p>Mercy Law sees access to justice as an enabling right which allows those who perceive their rights as having been violated to enforce them and seek redress.  Access to justice encompasses effective availability of access to legal information, timely advice and remedies, accessible legal representation, conflict resolution services, and to the courts system and a fair system of remedies.  Similarly to Community Law and Mediation, MLRC enables access to justice through the operations of legal outreach clinics, ensuring advice is embedded in the community and is accessible; free legal representation for marginalised groups; the provision of legal support for professionals and community organisations which are supporting homeless people to promote resolution of legal issues without the need for legal intervention; delivery of formal training on housing law to community groups and professionals; and active engagement in law reform and policy change.  Mercy Law's work is evidence that a community law centre model, similar to CLM's, can facilitate real access to justice.  At a recent MLRC event, the Chief Justice recognised the &quot;vital role&quot; that dedicated, community-oriented groups were providing, which would not be provided in any other way. <br\/><br\/>I will touch on some of the specific issues raised by the committee in its invitation.  Regarding barriers to accessing the courts, the primary challenge for any individual with a potential legal issue is access to legal advice and information in the first instance.  Many of the vulnerable groups and individuals Mercy Law engages with would struggle to access legal advice in the absence of our service, let alone access the courts system.  With respect to legal aid, the majority of our clients would be eligible under the Legal Aid Board's means test, but are essentially deemed ineligible because the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 specifically excludes the granting of legal aid in disputes concerning rights and interests over land.<\/p><p>An exemption to this exclusion does apply in limited circumstances but in our experience, this is not widely known or availed of.  MLRC believes that the current delivery of civil legal aid, specifically with regard to housing and homelessness matters, is wholly inadequate.  The level of legal aid provision on housing and homeless matters currently delivered by the board is negligible.  The board is not empowered or resourced to disseminate legal information and to have a community presence and outreach service, nor does it have any substantive role in law reform or policy.  The substantial delays in accessing advice present a further practical barrier in accessing justice through the scheme.  Often clients facing homelessness require a nimble service that can proactively reach out to local authorities in order to negotiate solutions.  This is not achievable if clients are required to wait weeks and months to meet with a solicitor.  <br\/><br\/>A common theme in our contact with lay litigants with housing issues is the challenge of identifying the relevant legal issue or rights violation without proper legal advice.  A disproportionate number of our clients who are in homelessness are migrants or those from ethnic minorities.  Together with individuals with literacy issues or a disability, as many of our clients do, these groups can face substantial challenges in engaging with court procedures and representing themselves adequately in court as lay litigants.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to highlight one issue regarding court structures, which is the absence of any tribunal or alternative dispute resolution process regarding housing matters.  MLRC frequently engages with local authorities on housing matters and sees the wide variation in how appeals are processed and a general lack of transparency and formalised process.  MLRC would welcome the development of an independent appeals forum outside the court system to protect housing rights and make a remedy more cost-effective and accessible, and reduce inconsistencies and related unfairness of current procedures.  In several instances, MLRC has advised and legally represented a large of number of clients who have been impacted by an identical issue.  In such situations, bringing individual sets of proceedings may be necessary to remedy the wrongs.  Class actions would provide for a much more efficient and cost-effective means of providing access to justice for a potentially large group of litigants.<br\/><br\/>MLRC warmly welcomes the current focus and expansion of <i>pro bono<\/i>in Ireland.  In 2017, MLRC initiated an innovative <i>pro bono<\/i>project in partnership with A&amp;amp;L Goodbody, Focus Ireland and the Public Interest Law Alliance.  This project involved corporate solicitors from A&amp;amp;L Goodbody attending a legal advice outreach clinic at Focus Ireland and providing legal advice and follow up legal representation.  Together with many other examples, this <i>pro bono<\/i>project has had a real impact.  This is extremely welcome but we firmly believe that <i>pro bono<\/i>cannot replace community-based and properly resourced legal advice and representation to vulnerable groups as a vital element of access to justice.  <br\/><br\/>In conclusion, I will highlight some key recommendations we made in our substantive submission.  We would like to see an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to ensure that legal aid is available on housing and homeless matters on the basis of established need for this service, a restructuring of the delivery of civil legal aid to bring it in line with the community law centre model and better resourcing, support for and visibility of existing community law centres.  We warmly welcome this opportunity to share our concerns with the committee and look forward to engaging with members on questions surrounding this issue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":789,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Keatinge.

In my opening statement, I will address five different points.  I will start by looking at the various barriers to access to justice.  As has already been indicated, there are a number of different factors that impede access to justice.  Chief among these is the issue of cost but there is also the question of people being unaware of their legal entitlements.  The Pringle committee further identified psychological or cultural barriers between disadvantaged individuals and communities and the legal world.  The nature of certain legal problems can also be an issue here.  What are known as problems of a diffuse nature, for example, in the area of consumer protection or environmental protection, can pose particular problems because they can impact on a large number of people but not on any one particular individual significantly or sufficiently to motivate that person to take legal action.  The special position of people with disabilities is another issue.  I know the committee is aware of section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, which imposes on all public bodies a duty to address issues of discrimination in the manner in which they deliver services.  This clearly applies to the Legal Aid Board.  I thought it worth mentioning that in a High Court decision in 2012, Mr. Justice Hogan also identified a constitutional duty imposed on the courts under Article 40.1 of the Constitution to make reasonable accommodation for litigants with physical disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly describe the different responses one can take to these barriers to access.  Models of legal aid fall into two categories.  The more restricted or conservative model is known as the service model.  This model focuses very much on the individual litigant and seeks to address the problem of cost.  Generally speaking, a service model will not address the other barriers to access I have mentioned.  Moreover, the service model provides what I would describe as conventional legal services and would not engage in programmes of political lobbying or education.  In contrast, the strategic model does attempt to address the various barriers I have mentioned.  Whereas the focus of the service model is very much on the individual, the focus of the strategic model is on the individual as presenting or representing a structural problem in society.  Strategic models will address not only the issue of cost but will also deal with the issue of people being unaware of their legal rights by providing programmes of legal education.  They will also try to address the psychological or cultural barrier by locating their services in disadvantaged areas to put people at their ease.  They also engage in campaigning for legal and social reform regarding the problems their clients present to them.  In the Irish context,  the strategic model is represented in the voluntary sector among community law organisations while the Legal Aid Board would use the service model.  <\/p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to a recent report published by the World Bank and the International Bar Association entitled A Tool for Justice: The Cost Benefit Analysis of Legal Aid, which was published in September 2019.  It is a cost-benefit analysis of legal aid that looks at various jurisdictions.  Unfortunately, Ireland was not one of the jurisdictions that was examined but the central point made by the report could equally apply here.  It is argues that while the provision of legal aid involves an immediate cost, it can bring about significant savings for the State in other areas.  In thinking about legal aid, we should not see it simply as net expenditure.  There are savings to be made and this warrants investment in legal aid.  <\/p> <p>  I will say a few things about the statutory scheme of civil legal aid.  I preface my remarks by acknowledging the great work done by the Legal Aid Board in delivering legal aid to individuals over the years in particularly trying circumstances.  I will highlight three limitations of the current scheme.  Some of these have already been mentioned.  The first is that the current scheme does not extend to the provision of legal representation before tribunals.  As has already been mentioned, social welfare appeals tribunals, cases going before the Workplace Relations Commission or cases going before the RTB are key areas, particularly for disadvantaged individuals, yet the current scheme means that the Legal Aid Board is not in a position to provide representation for anyone appearing before those tribunals.<\/p><p>The second limitation I would like to highlight refers to the exclusion of disputes concerning rights or interests in or over land from the availability of legal aid certificates.  At best the position here is unclear and at worst this exclusion could prevent the Legal Aid Board providing legal aid in respect of housing cases.  I have heard anecdotally that the board sometimes provides such support but it is not clear that this comes within the terms of the legislation.  It is an area that requires clarification.<\/p><p> My final point regarding the Legal Aid Board is to highlight the delays involved in obtaining consultation with solicitors in various centres.  In my submission I give more detail on the delays in various centres, which in some cases are in excess of a year.  This highlights the point that the Legal Aid Board is significantly under-resourced.  There is, again, anecdotal evidence that the board is having difficulty recruiting staff because the payscales it offers are simply not competitive with the private market or other positions in the public sector.  It is a serious matter that must be addressed quickly.<\/p><p> The other matter before the committee is litigation and rules of procedures.  I will make two very quick points in this regard.  There is a need for an appropriate system of class actions.  I understand legislation is currently before the Oireachtas on the topic and this mechanism is important.  Looking at the sort of law handled by law centres, the areas often have a significant public impact.  For example, in the area of social welfare, one social welfare claimant bringing a case could stand in the place of hundreds or perhaps even thousands of similarly situated welfare claimants.  An effective mechanism for processing those sort of disputes is by way of class action but, unfortunately, the mechanisms we have in this jurisdiction are not fit for that purpose.  Some change is needed here as well.<\/p><p> I mention in my submission that an alternative to class actions in some types of cases is for Departments to be encouraged, where they have been sued, to actively review their files and see if there are similarly situated cases that have not yet been litigated.  I commend the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as when it was sued in respect of the implementation of the third equality directive in the 1980s with respect to equality for men and women in social welfare, it engaged in just such an exercise.  In the absence of a class action, it is certainly something to be commended.<\/p><p> I will mention the mechanism of a protective costs order, which is available to the courts and can be granted to somebody in advance of litigation taking place.  It offers a sort of assurance to the litigant that even if the litigation is unsuccessful, the liability for costs would be limited.  However, that mechanism has a major limitation in that it is not available to a litigant with a personal interest in the litigation.  It only applies to a case where somebody is acting altruistically in the public interest.  For example, it would not apply to a social welfare claimant challenging the policy of the Department, although the policy would have implications for many others.  In my submission I highlight the matter and suggest that perhaps rules or procedures could be drafted to broaden the availability of this mechanism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerard Whyte","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Members will know that earlier, in private session, we acknowledged receipt of the copy of the report that Professor Whyte references from the World Bank, A Tool for Justice: The Cost-Benefit Analysis of Legal Aid.

In many respects, people only become aware of the law as a result of a traumatic event.  For example, people could be the victim of crime or be accused of a crime.  They could have a family law dispute and the break-up of a family or a row in employment or in a tenancy.  We just need to try to elaborate on what can be done to make people more aware of the law and the rights they have instead of waiting for people to have a traumatic event.<\/p> <p>  In these Houses, we spend all our time making laws but sometimes I wonder how many people are aware of the laws being made here.  What can be done in a practical sense to make members of the public aware of the law?  This does not apply simply to disadvantaged areas.  How can we make members of the public aware of the rights they have under the Constitution and, more specifically, under statute law?  How do the witnesses recommend we do it?

As the Deputy correctly indicated, sometimes people become aware of how the law is relevant to their lives through a traumatic event but sometimes it is still not obvious after a traumatic event.  We have experience of people coming into our clinic to get advice on a slip and fall, which is a classic legal matter.  Talking to these people one might also realise they are homeless or have been refused social welfare; they might have a range of legal issues that they may not even have identified as being legal problems.  Sometimes a traumatic event is not enough for them to crystallise it as a legal issue.<\/p> <p>  A community education programme is critical and it should go to the community, as we do, to speak to people about law, rights and how the law can be used to enforce those rights.  One must also work with organisations that might be contacted by individuals, including those dealing with citizens' information and family resource centres.  These are organisations that link with the community on a regular basis.  People might go to them for help but perhaps they might not categorise it as legal help.  We often go to the community and provide education to individuals and training or capacity-building for organisations that provide information.  They might be the first port of call for individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Rose Wall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":795,"content":"<p>We are similar to CLM in that we do much community education work.

We often find they are not aware of the information we give, so there is a need to educate people on fair procedures in dealing with local authorities, for example.  That touches on the constitutional rights issue.<\/p> <p>  We are often asked to go to an organisation and do a housing rights session.  We like to be able to do it but often this comes back to resources for us.  We are a small law centre with three solicitors and three administrative staff.

Do the witnesses think that another way of making people aware of their rights is that the people with whom they are engaged, be they employers, landlords or financial institutions, should have a greater obligation to apprise individuals of their legal rights in their dealings with them?

Putting an obligation on a landlord to inform people of their rights is difficult because the situation is already adversarial and there is a power imbalance.  We do not work much in the private rented sphere, as we are primarily focused on social housing, but in some instances we go to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  There is an inequality of arms there because often a landlord will have the resources to bring a solicitor, which is absolutely his or her entitlement, and it will ultimately assist the landlord.  We see the converse where the tenant perceives that he or she is disadvantaged, and in some respects he or she will be disadvantaged in being able to put his or her case forward properly because the legislation is vast and technical.<\/p> <p>  Professor Whyte raised the point about tribunals being excluded from the scope of civil legal aid, except for the International Protection Office.

In those circumstances one is looking at a relationship that is unbalanced with regard to resources.

They know about our law centre because it is embedded in the community, but they have not heard of the Legal Aid Board.  Family law is an area of demand for us.  The other main areas are housing, employment and debt.  There is a growing need arising in the area of education.  We have been handling many cases recently for children with disabilities who are put on shortened school days or who have informal exclusion mechanisms applied to them.  We are providing them with advice.  Those are the main areas, but they can change.

I find with people who come to our services through one of our outreach clinics that the costs and final outcome of the case are quite remote for them at that time.  As for accessing what can be a very difficult process to get through, for example, in an equal status case or an employment equality case, there is an obligation on the individual who is taking the case to make written submissions in advance of the case.  The case is front-loaded in that way.<\/p> <p>  Employment law is a massively technical area and often engages difficult concepts in European law.  That in itself is a barrier.  I accept that the WRC being a no-cost environment is one advantage but, for me, the intimidation begins at a much earlier stage and the advice or representation is required at that earlier stage.  Often in our advocacy work we might assist somebody in writing the initial letters and sometimes there is no need to progress with litigation and end up in the WRC.

As an adjunct to that in respect of the RTB, we deal with some matters where we appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  We are appealing a determination of the board and that is also a highly complex area.  We see lay litigants in that process who are struggling to articulate their case.  If one is seeking legal representation at the point where one is going to the High Court, that is another complicated scenario.  It points to the need for legal representation at the earlier stage.  As regards the fear of costs orders, we have had clients decide not to go to litigation because of the risk of a costs order.  They would have been public interest cases which would have affected many other clients, similar to the example Ms Wall gave.  The costs order consideration comes a little way down the line.

There is evidence of this in the Travers report dealing with the nursing home fees in the 2000s.  A class action would counter that because if the Department is facing a class action taken by two or three people representing a larger class, then settlement of that action changes the policy and so, for that reason, there is a need to introduce class actions.

I would like to tease out a few things a little more.  Almost all the contributors have referred to class actions, multiparty actions and the impact they may have.  I recently raised with the Minister for Health the case of a woman who had a settlement in court.  She is one of probably 150 or 200 people in the country who have made the same complaint and each has been told by their solicitor that they would have to take a separate case and it would be fought separately by the State because it feels it has an obligation to defend taxpayers' money.  That was the reason put forward.  I am trying to be delicate.  The excuse, or the reason, that is being put forward is that each individual's illness is particular to themselves and each has his or her own bodily system, which will react differently.<\/p><p>I find, however, that there is a tendency in these situations for the State to block or push back for as long as it can and when it realises that will not work it settles with a confidentiality clause.  It will then set up a system to bring all those people together and say there will be redress.  The difficulty is that the redress is part of that system of holding on for as long as possible, giving and admitting as little as possible.<\/p><p> What are the problems that could come into play in the multiparty action?  There is a resistance to that.  My colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and &Oacute; Laoghaire, have brought forward legislation and gone some distance with it but there is considerable resistance to this becoming law from the system.

In the US the class action works on the basis of two or three people presenting with a common problem.  The action goes ahead in the name of those individuals but subsequently if anybody else has been similarly affected they can get the benefit of the ruling.  This sets the context for the second problem which is that there are several people driving the action, there is a class behind them but will they properly represent the interests of their fellow class members or could their particular issues be addressed to the detriment of issues that other members of the class might want to see highlighted?  This type of problem can present itself.  I am not sure that it is possible to come up with a model that will avoid those.  We have to just engage with them on a case by case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerard Whyte"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":877,"content":"<p>Is it possible to ensure that the legislation contains as many conditions as possible to avoid any negative impact like that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#K00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":878,"content":"<p>I am not sure that can be done because those would be issues of fact.

It was used all over the world, yet in Ireland each person is fighting individually.  To me that would be a very typical multiparty class action and there would not be an issue because it is very clear there is a problem.  The reason Professor Whyte gives is valid but only to a certain extent.  When we get past that the multiparty or class action could bring huge benefit, not just from the point of view of the people taking it but from that of the State because the State is being put to huge cost defending each case.  Apart from legal costs there is the cost to society and the injustice to the individuals.<\/p> <p>  One of the big barriers for people is the cost of taking legal action.  They fear that if they lose the case they will lose a lot of money.  It can be a minor problem but they can feel very aggrieved.  Sometimes we, as elected representatives, meet individuals whose lives are dominated by some wrong that they felt happened to them and they could get no justice anywhere.  Sometimes they are on to us three and four times a week.  Their mental health is affected.  When we bore into it we might find that it started out as a minor issue but they found there was nowhere to go with it.  Is there scope to develop something like the small claims court?  I think at the moment the limit is &euro;2,000 and it has to be for the purchase of an item.  It is quite restricted.  Is there a possibility of opening that up for people to have access to justice that would not impose the big cost on them of having to employ a solicitor and get into a legal tangle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#K00600","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":880,"content":"<p>I think that probably goes back to a point that was made earlier by Ms Wall that a civil legal aid system should not be limited in terms of area of law but rather by a person's need for legal assistance.

I recall one person who came to a clinic who was living in a family hub and was in difficulty with their mobile phone provider.  This was having a disproportionate impact on that person's situation and was affecting their child's access to education because the person was not able to focus on making sure that was fulfilled.

They feel they cannot get anywhere.  On the other side, there are people in rented accommodation who do not pay the rent.  The landlord may put up with them for a year or two but cannot get anything out of them.  Eventually when the landlord gets them out they are left with a big bill which has been unpaid for a long time.  The tenant gets a house somewhere but the landlord wonders why they are letting houses to people who will not pay the rent.  They feel they have no come back because the first question a solicitor will ask is whether the person has any assets or money.  If the landlord says they do not seem to that causes a huge problem.

It could serve its warnings and be in there pretty quick.  Our understanding is that the RTB will prioritise the more straightforward cases.  There is also an enforcement process and mechanism within the RTB where, in some instances, it will take that forward and seek an order from the court to enforce it.   I hear what the Deputy is saying on the mark in respect of recovering it but landlords may reduce their potential losses by pursuing what is a remedy that is available to them at an earlier stage.  <\/p><p> With respect to conditions, the Mercy Law Centre would have traditionally looked to some of those cases to provide advice.  Given the scale of the homeless crisis, we are prioritising our cases so we devote a considerable time to the real acute need of people who cannot even access a bed for the night.  That is where our resources go.  There are certainly very legitimate legal issues for people who are in very substandard housing and whose health is being compromised by that but there is very little recourse in terms of legal advice.  When we have people contacting our service it is very hard to know where we can direct them to get that support. <\/p><p> I shall comment briefly on costs as mentioned by the Deputy.  There is the chilling effect of, potentially, getting a cost order against one.  Even paying basic stamp duty costs is a barrier in itself.  Many of the cases we are dealing with concern fair procedures and, therefore, are in the High Court so then one is into having &euro;300 to get a case initiated and then the costs will grow.  That is just simple stamp duty.  Those costs are a challenge for us, as a law centre, to meet if we are bringing a lot of litigation and for an individual the costs would be substantial as well.<\/p><p> Deputy Connolly asked about appeals mechanisms.  From our perspective on the housing side, if there were some consistency around how appeals were dealt with by the local authority that may be a mechanism to avoid, perhaps, going to the High Court in the first instance.  That could happen if one knew that one had a meaningful, transparent and consistent procedure that one could engage with that may resolve things and not require one to take a leap.  There could be an equivalent to the small claims court in the local authority housing sphere. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Rebecca Keatinge","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>We often find that cases go to an inappropriate court.

It was the Airey case that pushed the State into agreeing to provide free legal aid.  The Airey case was a fantastic case to bring but it only highlighted one of the problems that we have identified, that of cost.  Mrs. Airey was certainly not intimidated by the legal profession and was well aware of her legal rights.  Her particular problem was she could not afford legal representation so that was the sole focus of her case.  In turn, it meant that the State, in order to comply with Airey, only had to focus in on the issue of costs and did not have to address the other problems that were identified in the Pringle Report as barriers to accessing justice such as people being unaware of their rights or being intimated by the legal world.  The Airey case took the wind out the Pringle Report in the sense that now there was a State scheme and the State could say it complied with the European Convention on Human Rights but that is not the model recommended in the Pringle Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerard Whyte"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>We are here almost 50 years later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#L01000","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":895,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#L01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerard Whyte"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":896,"content":"<p>That is telling in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019121100002#L01200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":897,"content":"<p>We set up CLM Limerick in 2012-2013.

Until that time, the board had operated through 12 law centres, four of which were in Dublin with the other eight distributed around the country.  Now, there are approximately 30 law centres.  Under the statutory scheme, there has been a greater involvement of private practitioners.  As far as I recall, there was no involvement of private practitioners under its predecessor.  Essentially, there were 30 or so solicitors trying to provide legal aid for the entire country.  That has changed.  There are now more Legal Aid Board solicitors.

The expert advisory group on centenary commemorations was established by An Taoiseach in 2011.  The role of the group is to advise the Government on historical matters relating to the decade of centenaries and to provide guidance to inform the State's approach to the remembrance of significant historical events of the period.<\/p><p>The group is non-partisan, comprising independent historians, cultural practitioners, and custodians of archives from around the country.  Since 2012, the group has published three papers.  The expert advisory group's initial statement, published in 2012, was widely commended for providing a supportive structure of guiding principles, which underpinned the State's approach to commemorating the significant historical events that took place between 1912 and 1916, culminating with the centenary commemorations of the Rising.  The commemorative programme for the first half of the Decade of Centenaries was widely acclaimed for its inclusive, measured and sensitive approach, which recognised the legitimacy of all traditions and valued mutual respect and historical accuracy.  The programme remembered not only the seminal events that marked Ireland's journey towards independence and self-determination but also those which enhance our understanding of the wider international context during this period.<br\/><br\/>The second phase mission statement was published in October 2017.  The guiding principles expressed in the initial statement are still significant and relevant and they are reaffirmed in the group's second phase mission statement 2017-2023.  The guiding principles provide clarity and a broad template, intended to empower and support all those involved in delivering authentic, citizen-focused and appropriate commemorations at national and community level throughout the second half of the Decade of Centenaries.  In this statement, the expert advisory group advocated that, &quot;The opportunity to encourage scholarship at national and local level must be used as fully as possible, with particular emphasis on archival investment and development.&quot;  This significant capital investment will ensure that our cultural institutions and archives will continue to have a central role in continuing the process of broad public engagement, creating an important, tangible legacy that endures well beyond the Decade of Centenaries for generations to come.<br\/><br\/>The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht launched a public consultation process to assist the group in its work to provide guidance to the Government over the remainder of the decade.  Its objective was to give interested parties the opportunity to submit their views and ideas on how the significant historical events from 1918 to 1923 might be appropriately and respectfully remembered, in line with the principles expressed in the group's second phase mission statement.  Some 73 submissions were received and 20 of these were made by local authorities.  The rich diversity of ideas and perspectives was of great assistance to the group as it developed its guidance to Government.<br\/><br\/>The second phase guidance statement was published in January last and addresses the years 2018 to 2023.  It makes specific recommendations on how the significant historical centenaries in the forthcoming phase of the decade might be meaningfully, proportionately and sensitively remembered by the State.  These centenaries include the struggle for independence, the Civil War, the foundation of the State, partition and the foundation of Northern Ireland, and concluding with the admission of the Irish Free State into the League of Nations in September 1923.  The group was conscious, in formulating its guidance for this period, that the approaching centenaries present particularly complex and sensitive challenges, coinciding with significant 50th anniversaries in Northern Ireland.  The backdrop of Brexit and the continued absence of agreement on operating the devolved structures in Northern Ireland also present particular challenges.  The group encourages continued co-operation between the two jurisdictions where appropriate.  The exploration of potential cross-Border engagement will require careful, thoughtful and sensitive navigation.<br\/><br\/>The expert group recommends a three-tier approach comprising a small number of State-led commemorations, augmented by local authority and community-led commemorative initiatives.  This approach advocates a leading role for local authorities in supporting and driving community-led commemoration, augmented with appropriate State recognition, support and participation.  The community-led model was most effective in the remembrance of the centenary of the Soloheadbeg ambush on 21 January 2019.  This was a respectful, community-led commemoration, jointly organised by the Solohead Parish Centenary Commemoration Committee and the Third Tipperary Brigade Old IRA Commemoration Committee.  Their plans were supported by Tipperary County Council as part of a broader commemorative programme across the county to mark the centenary of the struggle for independence, and by the State.  This measured and balanced approach worked effectively in a complex and sensitive local context.  It echoes the most recent guidance of the expert group, which states:<\/p><blockquote>\tMany of the events of this period have great local significance; it is therefore appropriate for local authorities and local community organisations to be encouraged to lead the commemorative process.  Some events have been commemorated annually for decades and it would be inappropriate for the State to compete with these established ceremonies ... All commemorative events should be informed by the principles laid down in the Second Statement of the Expert Advisory Group. <\/blockquote><p>The group recommends that the State should continue to support local and county commemorative exercises to widen and deepen a historical understanding of the significance of the events being commemorated among the public at large.  The expert group has recommended a small number of formal State commemorations over the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries.  A State commemoration for all of those who lost their lives during the struggle for independence is to take place in 2021, the National Day of Commemoration takes place on Sunday, 11 July, so that might be an appropriate date.  The existence of this established State ceremonial event may offer a fitting opportunity for an enhanced State contribution.  The group recommends a State commemoration, focusing on themes of remembrance and reconciliation, to take place on a neutral date for all of those who suffered and died during the Civil War.<br\/><br\/>The group advocates that the centenary of the foundation of the State be remembered in terms of a process rather than a single event.  It began with the handing over of Dublin Castle on 16 January 1922 and ended with the formal coming into being of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922, in the midst of civil war.  To these ends, two formal State commemorations are recommended, namely a State ceremonial event in Dublin Castle to mark the symbolic transfer of power to the newly emerging Irish State with the hand-over of Dublin Castle; and a State commemoration on 6 December 2022 in recognition of the pioneering leaders who helped to embed the democratic tradition in the newly emerging Irish State.  The group recommends that the centenary of the partitioning of Ireland and the foundation of Northern Ireland be remembered with a significant academic conference.  It is also recommended that a conference such as this could examine comparative partitions in Europe post 1918, to emphasise that Ireland&rsquo;s experience was not unique.  Finally, the group recommends a State ceremonial event to mark the centenary of the admission of the Irish Free State into the League of Nations in 2023.<br\/><br\/>On legacy, the group highlighted the fact that the Decade of Centenaries created unprecedented opportunities for people of all ages to consider and explore some of the most significant events and themes in the history of modern Ireland.  The group recommended that this positive engagement and the associated tangible, long-term benefits should continue to be supported beyond the conclusion of the decade in 2023 and that State support should be considered for specific, significant Decade of Centenaries permanent legacy initiatives.  One such initiative is the Beyond 2022: Ireland&rsquo;s Virtual Record Treasury Initiative, which the group has endorsed as a potentially significant and lasting Decade of Centenaries legacy, combining historical research, archival conservation, technical innovation and international collaboration.<\/p><p>It seeks to reimagine and recreate, through virtual reality, the Public Record Office of Ireland and its archival collection, which were destroyed on 30 June 1922 in the opening engagement of the Civil War.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Maurice Manning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":943,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.

However, there is a series of structures in place to assist the Government on the delivery of the programme of commemorations over the second half of the decade.  Primary among those is the expert advisory group itself, which has provided advice that the Government has accepted on the appropriate manner and mechanisms for commemorating these events over the next number of years.  In addition to that, there is the all-party Oireachtas group, which meets regularly and has made a very important and valuable contribution to the commemoration of these seminal events.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out that there are a whole range of stakeholders across civil society, national cultural institutions, other Government Departments and local authorities.  In particular, and building on the work of the expert advisory committee over a great number of years, is the work of local historical societies and interest groups.  That was very much reflected in one of the key events of last year in Soloheadbeg in Tipperary.  Tipperary County Council is here with us today, and I would like to congratulate it on its recent award from Chambers Ireland for its events.<\/p> <p>  A wide range of stakeholders have come forward with proposals, and the Government has committed &euro;2 million in the context of the budget Estimates for 2020, which is an increase of around &euro;900,000.  We have more or less doubled the resource.  That has largely been applied to supporting the local authorities, the academic community and our cultural institutions and a range of other measures in 2020 that will give rise to a programme that will go to Government shortly.  There is a number of strands under creative imagination, historical exploration and community.  Our proposals in those areas are well developed, but they are constantly evolving as various stakeholders come forward with proposals.  At some stage we will need to draw a line under that and produce the highlight for people to see.  Whatever list will be produced will never be exhaustive.  Events are being proposed and delivered through a whole range of stakeholders, including at a local level, and it is very difficult to capture the full value of that in a single document.

I would like to thank the members of the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting today.  As we move into the final years of the decade of centenaries, and are facing the challenge of commemorating events from a very turbulent and sensitive part of our history, I would like to share today some of our experiences in Tipperary and talk about a model of collaboration which was very successful for us in 2019.  We have, like our colleagues across the country, been involved in marking centenaries since 2012, through the various cultural services in the county, such as the heritage and arts offices and the library and museum services.  We also took part in the Ireland 2016 programme, which nationally generated an unprecedented groundswell of creative engagement and participation on the theme of commemorations in what was a hugely successful two-year programme.  The legacy of this programme was an engaged public who had been activated, and were interested in exploring their own history and marking the centenaries of events that had happened in their localities.  The challenge facing both them and us were the fact the period of commemoration we were moving into was turbulent and divisive.<\/p> <p>  Unlike the 1916 events, which had happened largely outside of our county, we were now moving into a period of time where, due to the War of Independence and the Civil War, a significant amount of activity took place in Tipperary.  This included events, such as the Soloheadbeg ambush, which is generally seen as the first action of the War of Independence in January 1919 and which resulted in the loss of two lives.  There is a significant challenge in commemorating events like this, not least because the historical narrative and the legacy for those involved and their descendants is so completely different.  Soloheadbeg was never going to be an easy event.  In June 2018, I was approached by a group of locals who had formed a committee to mark the centenary in Solohead parish.  They had come together to consider an incident that had happened in their locality 100 years previously, and the tone that they were setting was respectful and inclusive, and one of remembrance.  <\/p> <p>  Over the next month, I provided whatever support I could, and facilitated support from the commemorations unit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  A number of activities took place around the centenary, including a project with the local primary schools.  A formal commemoration took place on 20 January, at which relatives of the people who carried out the ambush, the relatives of the county council employees who were there on the day and the relatives of those who lost their lives were in attendance.  An information panel was unveiled at the site of the monument at Solohead Cross, and a publication detailing the events of the day and details of all those who had been present was released and made available to those in attendance.  To tie in with this, the county museum and local historical society also hosted a conference the day before this event.<\/p> <p>  Great credit is due to the organising committee for taking on this event, and for at all times adhering to the principles of respectful and inclusive commemoration.  They brought together all elements of the community, and together they worked through any challenges that arose.  The history books record these events in great detail, but we must also remember that the narratives that have been handed down through generations are powerful and emotive.  The input of local communities on the ground is essential to navigating the path to inclusivity and sensitivity in these matters.<\/p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge the support and advice for this event.  We were delighted to recently be awarded the Chambers Ireland Excellence in Local Government Award in the commemorations category, and we were delighted to have the chairman of the Solohead committee with us on the night to receive this award as it recognises the importance of the partnership between local authorities and local communities in relation to commemorations.<\/p> <p>  This partnership model was also central to our submission to the public call by the expert advisory committee on commemorations in 2018.  In Tipperary, we believe this is what works best for us in engaging the public in the commemorations process.  The committee we worked with in Solohead certainly had huge capacity, but we would hope to grow this in other groups around the county, and encourage them to adopt the methods and approach used by this group.  Resources are essential to this, and we have run a number of grant schemes since 2015 which provide supports to groups in this area.  This is something that we would hope to continue to 2023.  Again, we acknowledge the support of the commemorations unit and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in helping us to do this on an annual basis.  As we now approach 2020, we are again reaching out to our communities and organisations in County Tipperary, with a view to working with them and supporting them in remembering the events of 100 years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":947,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms O'Grady.

The first point I would like to raise is an issue in relation to finance.  Is the proposed allocation for local authorities &euro;10,000?  If that is so, it is a significant decrease from the allocation in 2016, which I believe was &euro;50,000.  One would have thought it would have been the other way around, because 2016 commemorated events that essentially took place in a very small number of locations.<\/p><p>In 2020, however, we are commemorating events that took place in virtually every parish in the country.  If we are going to work to a local authority model, it would seem to me that &euro;10,000 is a very small amount to be spread across counties such as Tipperary - where there was a lot of action, Galway or Cork etc.  I would be interested in hearing confirmation of what the allocation is.  How much did we spend in total in 2016 and how much will we spend in 2020?  Mr. Falvey says it was &euro;2 million this year and it was &euro;900,000 last year but the real comparison is with this year of high activity all around the country.  It is much more pervasive than the events of 1916 and 2016 is the mirror of that.  How does the money compare between 2016 and 2020 in total and how much are we giving to local authorities for 2020 compared with 2016?<\/p><p> Has consideration been given by the Department to putting a special fund aside to refurbish every monument to the period?  These monuments are in every part of the country.  There are many roadside monuments to engagements that took place during the War of Independence, and it was a war of independence.  Has the Department considered providing funding, either through the local authorities or through any other appropriate organisation, for the refurbishment of all these monuments, many of which are suffering from the ravages of time?<\/p><p> I read the report of the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations and my views are known to that committee because I am on the parliamentary advisory committee.  To me, democracy was founded in 1919.  This is the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and nobody disputes that across all the political divides in this country.  The First D&aacute;il was the first and this is the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I was gratified and taken by the fact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recently published a book outlining the history of foreign affairs in an independent Ireland and it started in 1919 because the events of 1919 and 1921 shaped an awful lot of foreign affairs post the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  The setting up of the First D&aacute;il and everything that happened after that was to establish a native Government here.  It might not have been recognised by the British but that was their problem.  American Independence Day is 4 July to commemorate the day they signed their declaration of independence.  I am a little disappointed there are no national commemorations or highlighting of, for example, the fact the justice system and the District Court system in particular were set up during that time.  One of the keystones of democracy is there is a Government and there is some way of adjudicating the law.  I am also disappointed with the lack of commemoration of the role of foreign affairs.  Extraordinarily among independence movements around the world, an independent foreign affairs process was built and put in place.  It is well chronicled by the Department.  That is worth commemorating because it was totally unusual.  Most people thought independence would come in the field as a result of battle but these were huge innovations at that time.  I have constantly argued for us to commemorate the death of Terence MacSwiney by hunger strike because it was worldwide news and had huge influence in places such as India and within Europe.  I know other people died on hunger strike but that was the one that reached across the nations and had world resonance.  Why did the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations not see that?  There is no conflict involved in this.  No weapons were used except the weapon of self-sacrifice.  Why has no big State commemoration been recommended by the expert advisory group on centenary commemorations for this event?  It seemed to me to be worthy of a commemoration, particularly seeing as he was the mayor of the city of Cork, the third largest city in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#D00900","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":952,"content":"<p>I will direct those questions go dt&iacute; an Roinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#E00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":953,"content":"<p>On the funding for local authorities for this year, the budget for this is still in draft form and has not been signed off, but the proposal is for &euro;10,000 per local authority.  It is also proposed, where there are significant centenaries in individual local authority areas, that the Department would support local authorities to an additional level, as we would have done this year with Soloheadbeg and Knocklong, for example.  The level of funding was in the order of &euro;30,000 per local authority in 2016.  The events of 2016 were more concentrated in the year in question and the commemorations for 2020 and beyond would be over a longer period.  We can look at the levels of resourcing in the long term beyond 2020 in the context of normal budget and Estimate processes but, broadly speaking, that is the proposed level of funding in draft form.<\/p> <p>  The expert advisory group on centenary commemorations might come back to this but we have been in consultation with other Departments on their plans and proposals.  The Department of Justice and Equality has plans to commemorate the founding of the Courts Service, the introduction of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 and the pre-1922 judicial system.  As the Deputy knows, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has published a document commemorating the foundation of the diplomatic service.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has plans for the Custom House.  A range of proposals is emerging across Departments and cultural institutions for the appropriate commemoration of the events.  The State will be supporting those commemorations and applying resources for those purposes.  Some of that will fall into this budget and some of it may fall elsewhere, depending on the nature of the event and where it is being held.  There is a range of proposals across different Government Departments that go beyond the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We have been consulting on that and an interdepartmental committee has been established and is meeting regularly to provide updates and to gather all the information on the plans and proposals across Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Conor Falvey"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I am all for academia and all the rest but these are not people's events.  The people of Ireland are not celebrating that they independently chose to set up their justice system or diplomatic system.  These commemorations involve all sorts of Departments but there do not seem to be any big public events to highlight these extraordinary developments under a Government that was operating under massive constraints but that embedded democracy.  I am focusing on 2020 because as far as I am concerned, we can come back to 2021, 2022 and 2023 again.  I am purposely taking a short-term view of it because of the immediacy of 2020 and there could be many differences between now and next year.  We will park 2021 and 2022.  Another event worth commemorating is the big debate that took place in the D&aacute;il to make the Army subservient to the D&aacute;il.  That was an extraordinary debate to take place and an extraordinary decision to make in the middle of a war.  The D&aacute;il took responsibility for all military activities as a result of that.  These are major events that stood this State in huge stead into the future.  The bedrock of it all were the events of 1920 and for some reason we seem to be brushing over these commemorations for 2020.  We are trying to be fast with the commemorations for 2020 and trying to see if we can move on, even though it was probably one of the most significant years in the State's history, building on 1919.  Having a meeting of the First D&aacute;il was easy.  It was making the First D&aacute;il do what it said on the tin, namely become a real and effective Government in Ireland, that was difficult.  Local government was taken over in that period as well but that is more relevant to the 2021 commemorations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#E00400","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":955,"content":"<p>Dr. Manning wanted to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#E00500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for being such a positive member of the all-party committee and for his contributions over the past while.

As the Deputy states, we need to know the nuts and bolts of how all this happened, the models they adopted, their successes and where they may not have been successful.  The Secretary General to the Government has sent instructions on this and much work is being done.  There is a history of the local government process that is very much under way and it is being undertaken by the Department.<\/p> <p>  It may surprise people to discover that the Department of Justice and Equality is working on the early days of the justice system.  The Law Library, which is not part of the State apparatus, is very conscious of what happened in the courts.  There is a series of different projects in place that will try to present by the end of this period a pretty full and detailed account of how the State was set up, who were the ordinary people, how did they go about their work, what were their problems, etc.  This very much fits with the Deputy's point that this must be done.  He mentioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which has done a great job so far on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Terence MacSwiney, the committee is very much taken with the Soloheadbeg template because it worked.  Cork very much wants to play a major role in the coming year with major ceremonies, including those marking the burning of Cork and Terence MacSwiney.  We are working very closely on that with the authorities in Cork, although we are in the early stages.  There is a commitment for support of a major event in Cork marking that history.  Of course, there will be State participation in and support for that.  Our experience demonstrates that where there is strong local leadership, it is better for the State to come in to supplement it rather than everything coming from the top down.

Aside from the date, it was just an engagement, and some would argue whether it was the first engagement of the War of Independence.  The Ballyvourney people might tell us it is not true but we will not go there.  That is not comparable with commemorating Terence MacSwiney because nobody outside Ireland knows about Soloheadbeg.  However, people in the area are very conscious of the Terence McSwiney legacy.  Dr. Manning said that Soloheadbeg can be a model but there was a State commemoration at Banna Strand.

I tried knocking on the door of the expert advisory group as an independent but could not get in.  As Mr. Falvey said, there is a significant element of creativity and imagination involved and I thought that I could have brought something to that but I was not in the right territory to be allowed onto the cross-party group.<\/p><p>In October, I chaired a session in Castlebar on Mayo's involvement in the civil war which I thought would be kind of dull and uninteresting.  It was based on a book by Mr. Dominic Price entitled <i>The Flame and The Candle,<\/i>which is brilliant  Even though I am from Mayo, I never knew we had such an involvement in the civil war in 1921.  Professor Diarmaid Ferriter spoke at the session and hundreds of people turned up to a local event organised as part of the Wild Atlantic Words literary festival.  When I say hundreds turned up, they came from everywhere to hear about their fathers and grandfathers who had fought in the war and who did or did not get the pension and so on.  The local is the national.  It is so important.  The three-tiered approach described by Ms O'Grady is a very good way forward, particularly the use of the local.  As we saw with The Gathering, the creativity and imagination of the local area, town or village is so important.  I commend our witnesses on that element.  Anybody can organise State commemorations and I agree that we might need to rethink some of those.  <\/p><p>The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht must provide sufficient funding to allow the local to be as brilliant as it can be but &euro;10,000 would not whitewash a wall.  We cannot beg for funding from other Departments either.  I often visit the Department, which is wonderful.  I do not mean to undermine anybody but the Department must stand up for itself financially even if it is not considered as important as other Departments.  In this instance, a generous budget must be provided if we want the local to do the national and bring in all of the different elements, including the turbulence that we are trying to platform but not in a turbulent way.  We are trying to expose it in the best way possible.  <\/p><p>Is money available for partnerships with entities other than local authorities?  I am thinking here of the beleaguered RT&Eacute;, the Abbey Theatre, orchestras, museums, libraries and so on.  The witnesses said that they received 73 submissions, of which 20 were from local authorities.  Were there submissions that the witnesses thought were brilliant and has money been set aside for those?  They all come under some local authority - they are not sitting out in the sea - but is additional money available for them?  The local is the way to go.  The State commemorations will happen anyway and we could be a little bit more creative about those but the local is essential.  I could not believe my eyes at that event in Castlebar.  Hundreds of people attended and got something out of it.  They spoke, answered questions and it was just like being back in time, listening to peoples' stories.  It seemed like the whole of the county turned up to what was expected to be a small event.  It could have been held in the 3Arena, such was the size of the audience.  There are moments when the local becomes the national.  The Department is doing a wonderful job but I hope there is enough money for the best local projects.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that &euro;10,000 is not enough.  What is that about?  Why are we begging from other Departments?  Of course they have to pay their way, but why are we begging?  <\/p><p>In Dr. Manning's opinion, what stands out from the 1916 commemorations?  Is there an event where we got it completely right?

I am not asking in the context of something that could be replicated but am just asking a general question about any event that worked both locally and nationally.  If someone asked me about 1916, I would say that the Army played a magnificent part in both the small and great commemorations.  If I was asked who I was most proud of, I would say the Army.  I was impressed by the way our armed forces put order and smacht on everything.  I invite Dr. Manning or any of the other witnesses to answer that question.  Is there anything that stays with them, an event whose tentacles are still alive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#G00400","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":976,"content":"<p>What struck me was the input of the local authorities, which we had not factored in during our first meetings.

Other examples include the GPO museum, the upgrading of Kilmainham Gaol and Courthouse and, above all, the Bureau of Military History archives.

I know historians and guides leading walking tours are often asked why there is no plaque there and in other locations.<\/p><p> I was listening to a podcast recently, \"Three Castles Burning\" by Donal Fallon, in which Lorcan Collins said that he thinks there is a Fawlty-esque policy in this city of \"don't mention the war\", whereby people are afraid that visitors, particularly those from England, might be offended by the fact we had some kind of revolution.  I am not offended when I walk through London and I see a statue of Oliver Cromwell, so why should we not have some plaques to our revolutionaries?<\/p><p> I believe the Glasnevin wall will also feature those who died in the War of Independence and Civil War.  Will that include the Black and Tans?  Will it be in alphabetical order?  I know many would be uneasy with that and, indeed, those who fought for our independence were an uneasy alliance of people anyway.  Will that still be the practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#J02100","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>We have no function at all in that matter.

I accept there is a programme to come down the tracks which will provide greater detail.  I was personally concerned before the full programme for 2016 events came forth yet the 2016 commemoration was a success, and credit is due to the Department, the local authorities and local communities.<\/p><p>Extraordinary things happened in local communities.  In my own area, in Ballyphehane, the streets are named after the signatories and there was a whole year of plays, walks, matches, parades, debates and Tidy Towns events, for example, at Carrigaline.It was extraordinary and the communities really led from the front.  There is huge appetite.  It is incredible that a cinder block of a book, the <i>Atlas of the Irish Revolution<\/i>, became such a bestseller and they could not print enough of them.

Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain was killed in March 1920, the centenary of which is only three months away.  We talk about Terence MacSwiney and it is one of the seminal events but, in Cork, Mac Curtain and MacSwiney are inextricably linked.  Their fingerprints are throughout the city and we cannot escape the legacy of Mac Curtain and MacSwiney, which we see in the schools and everywhere else.  That is coming right down the tracks and I am anxious about it.<\/p><p>When is the programme coming down the tracks?  The burning of Cork was this day 99 years ago.  I was at the turning on of the Christmas lights on St. Patrick's Street a few weeks ago where everything as far as the eye could see was burned to the ground by the Black and Tans 99 years ago.  Are there plans to commemorate that?  These are important events.  I am sure that Cork City Council is planning events but I want to know what the Department is going to do.  There must be more of a financial commitment because there is no way that local authorities are going to be able to do what they want with the finance that is available.  I understand that our guests are not going to be able to answer me immediately, but please take the message back to the Minister that more funding is needed.

I find the points of comparison that could be made between the two revolutions very stimulating and that is what I was speaking on at the conference in Philadelphia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22019121100002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Martin Mansergh"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1062,"content":"<p>A final question that occurred to me that I intended to ask with the other four was about Bloody Sunday and the GAA.

I take this opportunity to congratulate the team on its fantastic achievements.  Ireland was a finalist and silver medalist in the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup and recently qualified for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.  At a time when the committee is dealing with challenging times in Irish sport it is particularly refreshing and heartening to have a great news story to tell here today.  Hockey Ireland and, in particular, the women's hockey team should be very proud of their achievements nationally and on the world stage in recent years.  The recent qualification for the Tokyo Olympics in a heart-stopping penalty shoot out against Canada will go down as one of those famous &quot;the nation holds its breath&quot; moments for many years to come.  On behalf of the joint committee, I thank the team for bringing the country so much joy, happiness and pride once again.

That saves me reading the first paragraph of our presentation.  We thank the joint committee for inviting us to present on the challenges facing minority sports and to talk about women in sport in Ireland.  I will talk about the road we have travelled recently and highlight some of the opportunities and challenges facing us as a minority sport.<\/p> <p>  Hockey Ireland is the national governing body for the sport of hockey in Ireland, doing its work in all 32 counties of Ireland in leading and developing the sport.  Hockey Ireland in its current form was established in 2000 as a result of the merger of the two pre-existing unions which governed men's and women's hockey separately.  We are now joined as one organisation.  Both pre-existing unions originated in the 19th century, in 1893 for the men and 1894 for the women.  The men's Irish Senior Cup was first played for in the season of 1893&ndash;94, making it the oldest field hockey cup competition in the world and one of the oldest cups in sport in Ireland and perhaps in the world.  The sport's 150 clubs and 280 schools are affiliated to Hockey Ireland through its branch network.  The Irish Universities Hockey Association, which governs the sport in Ireland's university system, is also affiliated to Hockey Ireland.<\/p><p>We have a total of 26,351 registered players, 17,339 women and 9,012 men.  Masters hockey is growing fast and makes it a sport for life.  Hockey Ireland is funded through the following mechanisms: membership fees; grants from Sport Ireland, Sport Northern Ireland and the Olympic Federation of Ireland; and partnerships with sponsors.  As is very particular to the minority sports we are not funded through TV revenues and receive only limited gate receipts.  From the point of view of women in sport, we currently boast a 65% female participation share.  However, there is much work to be done in other areas improving the female numbers.  We are focusing at present on the leaders in our sport; with programmes developing female coaches and umpires supported by the women in sport funding initiative.<\/p><p> In 2016, for the first time in over 100 years for Irish Hockey, the Irish men's team competed in an Olympic Games and finished tenth out of the 12 teams competing.  The year before, in 2015, the men stood on the podium with a bronze medal at the European Championships.  The Rio result was not what we had hoped for and we were disappointed, but the experience of the games was important, and it inspired hockey in Ireland.  In the evaluation after the games the lack of a proper high-performance structure in Hockey Ireland and uncertainty around funding were mentioned as factors affecting the result.  The men had to work or study and fundraise at the same time as preparing for the games.  Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland funding improved significantly and has enabled Hockey Ireland to engage a full-time performance director, provide better support to the players and increase the number of times the national teams can train.  The new national sports policy is extremely encouraging for the athletes and will have a significant impact on sport in Ireland.  Sponsorship is growing but, compared with the funding we get from Government, still limited.<\/p><p> In August 2018, in London's Queen Elizabeth Park, the venue of the London games, the Irish women's hockey team won the silver medal at the International Hockey Federation, FIH, world cup.  It was the most successful result ever for a senior team sport in Ireland.  No doubt the team had risen to this level with far fewer resources and finances than most of the opposition, but it was proved that we can reach the highest level.  Although we are a minority sport, the sport became instantly mainstream in the media and the team was met with a hero's welcome in Dublin, where 10,000 fans came to see their heroes.  The viewing figures from RT&Eacute; showed an average of 381,500 people watching that game with a share of 41% of all TV viewers at that moment, which is a pretty good figure.<\/p><p> The success had an immediate result - clubs had an influx of new members, or now have waiting lists for new members, or people became interested in the sport but there was no club in their area or no room in the club.  To sustain the growth of the sport, Hockey Ireland has had to enhance its strategy to develop the sport at grassroots level with development officers, and more coaches and umpires.  Clubs need facilities to play the sport and investment in hockey pitches spread over Ireland is crucial.  The number of under-18s entering the sport has been growing steadily over the past eight years.  However, year on year, the number of adults playing the sport remains level or is declining slightly.  In our last session on future strategy we recognised changes in the way people spend their time and the influence lifestyle changes and new technology have.  Our competition structure may need to move with the times, to shorten the engagement with the sport, or find other ways to reduce the time commitment of playing hockey regularly.<\/p><p> To promote the game, our grassroots introduction to hockey programmes, the hockey skills challenge and tricks for sticks attracted more than 16,000 players this year, but, as has been said, the growth at club level is hampered by capacity problems, as well as instances of insufficient numbers of skilled volunteers and club leaders.  We are also proud of the development of para-hockey in Ireland, a format for hockey players with intellectual disabilities providing national and international competition in hockey.  The silver medal for the women's team was not the end goal, this was on the road to something bigger, namely the Olympic Games in Tokyo.  Last month, the Olympic qualification reached its climax in a two-game challenge, on goal aggregate, against Canada.  The men travelled to Vancouver and missed out due to a controversial video umpire decision in the last seconds of the second game, reducing their 6-5 lead to 6-6 on aggregate with Canada winning 5-4 in the penalty shoot-out.  The women played at home in Dublin.  Hockey Ireland knew the interest in the games would be big and we installed a hockey pitch over the existing rugby pitch in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook.  It was only the second time ever that this technology was used, and it worked even in the torrential rain during the first game.  After full time in the second match the score was 0-0 and it went to a penalty shoot-out.  Ireland made a poor start to the shoot-out and found itself trailing 3-1, with Canada just one goal away from snatching the Olympic dream.  Then the green army came back to win 4-3 when the shoot-out went to sudden death.  The match also saw a record number in attendance with 6,137 spectators going through the gates on Sunday and on Saturday there was a similar number, the biggest crowd ever for a women's international team event in Ireland.<\/p><p> Nicci Daly, one of the players, who is also with us today, told RT&Eacute; on the night: \"It's everything.  The whole process, it's always for the Olympics.  We've come close in the past.  This is the dream.  This is everything to us. . . . and what a way to do it!\"  Meanwhile, captain Katie Mullen said: \"I'm just so incredibly proud of this bunch of players.  We have worked so hard, some of us have put in 10, 12 years, and it's also for all the players that have gone before us.  All those who committed so much of their lives to international hockey and never made it to an Olympics.  We are representing them.  I am so delighted!\"<\/p><p> The challenge now, and one of the points we want to make here today is that we must do whatever we can to support our athletes to maintain the level that this group has now achieved.  We need to provide the athletes with world-class support and facilities and the ability for them to focus completely on their performance.  The inspiration that the hockey players are giving as role models for young girls to take up hockey, or any other sport, is significant.  It is a promotion for Ireland, it makes people feel national pride and it gets people moving and being healthier.  The Government's investment in the new hockey pitch at the Sport Ireland campus will help our preparations for the games significantly.  It is important to get fully conditioned to the surface the team will find in Tokyo.  As one of the few top teams we can now practise on a pitch built to the exact same Poligras Tokyo GT standards as the Olympic arena.  The facilities at the Sport Ireland Institute are world class and the envy of many nations.  The joint approach between the Olympic Federation of Ireland and Sport Ireland in preparing for the games is significant and professional.<\/p><p> For minority sports, the Olympic Games are hugely important and even more so for team sports.  We are guaranteed at least five games in the opening phase for the country to get behind the green army and based on the viewing figures of the Olympic qualification and 2018 FIH World Cup, the Irish public will be following the team on television in large numbers.  The particular challenge of minority sports is that the interest in the sport will be at its highest at the Olympic Games, but commercial opportunities are limited as no team advertising is allowed at the games.  However, the attention will be a huge driver for participation.<\/p><p> These are exciting times for Hockey Ireland but they are also challenging.  While we have the opportunity to speak, there are a few other points that we and probably all Irish sports NGBs want to bring to your attention.  First, NGBs are facing significantly increased costs in insurance, which unfortunately is money that we have to pay and cannot use for the development of the sport.  Second, there may be ways of supporting the governing bodies by looking at the VAT regime for sport.  Some of our expenses - and this, for instance, was highly relevant when hosting the Olympic qualifiers - are subject to VAT that we cannot recover.  Finally, we get increased support from the commercial sector in the form of sponsorship but there is also significant interest in supporting the game at all levels through charitable donations and it would be great if tax benefits around such schemes could support the charitable activities of the federations.<\/p><p> I would like to hand over to Ms Lisa Jacob, a member of the board, who will finish our presentation with the board's perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Pels","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1081,"content":"<p>As a member of the Hockey Ireland board, I would like to take a little time to give the committee an insight into the current position in which the sport of hockey finds itself, the key challenges it faces and the broad strategic direction the board is proposing to take over the next three to five years.  I propose to speak to three key areas that together take up a significant part of the board&rsquo;s time and resources.  These areas broadly map to many of the key areas set out in the recent National Sports Policy 2018-2027.  The three areas I will focus on are governance; structures; and strategy, with particular reference to participation and development.<\/p> <p>  It is important to record that Hockey Ireland&rsquo;s approach to governance is led and informed by the principles of good governance as outlined in the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity, CVC, sector.  The board has a governance subcommittee which, on a \"comply or explain\" basis, monitors, reviews and updates or develops policies and other by-laws on an ongoing basis to meet the ever changing needs of the sport and its membership.  In fact, over the past 18 months the subcommittee has successfully completed a comprehensive update of the organisation's by-laws and policy documentation.  Governance is a regular item on board meeting agendas triggered by update reports from the subcommittee.  Our approach to governance also includes a new method for sourcing and recruiting members to the board.  We aspire to gender equality and look to provide a positive role model to our provinces and clubs in this regard.  This is evidenced by the fact that our 12-person board had until very recently a 50:50 gender split.  We believe we were one of the few sporting boards to achieve this level of equality.  However, due to the recent loss of one of our female board members, we currently have a 7:5 male to female split.  This still falls above the minimum best practice target of 40% which is set, for example, for State boards.  The presidency of Hockey Ireland, which rotates between the four provinces, also looks to ensure, where possible, that there is a gender rotation through each new presidential term.<\/p> <p>  On structures, Hockey Ireland has recently rolled out and implemented the first comprehensive database of its membership.  The introduction of this type of information system was a strategic priority in our last strategy and when fully operational will provide invaluable feedback that can be used for the benefit of the entire membership.  While there are a few outstanding gaps - namely umpires, schools, third level, and masters players to be added - the next big cohort of the hockey family to be accommodated is our volunteers, the lifeblood of the organisation on a day-to-day basis.  Members of Hockey Ireland are currently catered for through membership of their respective clubs which, in turn, are affiliated to their respective province.  The new database will help to link these members more closely to the national body and at the same time will provide the clubs and provinces with easy access to additional information such as lists of members with skill-sets such as coaching qualifications, umpire accreditation and administrative experience.<\/p> <p>  On strategy, Hockey Ireland caters for the hockey community on an all-island basis. This bring significant advantages but also adds a degree of complexity to the administrative process required to manage the sport across two different jurisdictions.  As with any sport there are areas of greater club and player density.  These are driven partly by an urban-rural divide but are also an artefact of the manner in which the sport was first introduced into the country over a hundred years ago.  From a board perspective this presents a significant opportunity as there are communities within both the urban and rural areas that are keenly interested in developing sport and in particular the sport of hockey.  The recent successes of the national senior men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s teams has served to create a positive impression of a sport that can be played throughout one&rsquo;s lifetime.  The men&rsquo;s participation at the Rio Olympics, the women&rsquo;s silver medal performance at the world cup and subsequent qualification for the Tokyo Olympic Games have provided exemplary roles models for the younger generations.  Hockey as a sport caters equally to both genders and all ages, from 4 years to 80 years plus, as evidenced at a recent masters hockey tournament.  As Mr. Pels said, it is also important to note that the sport of parahockey is continuing to grow and provides, through the club system, the opportunity for individuals with intellectual difficulties to participate and enjoy the camaraderie and health benefits of the sport.  The current public profile of the sport was brought to a crescendo at the Olympic qualifier tournament, held in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook at the start of November this year.  While the success of the women&rsquo;s team in such a nail biting finish was fantastic, the fact that over 12,200 people attended over the two nights of the weekend showed that interest in the sport was at an all-time high.<\/p> <p>  While perceived as expensive, hockey is at its most basic level a relatively inexpensive activity.  In essence, there are only three requirements to get a community up and running to get started in the sport; a playing surface, hockey sticks and balls and a coach with an understanding of the basic skills of the game.  The provision of the equipment has an easy solution that Hockey Ireland and the clubs and provinces can provide if appropriately supported.  The two challenges are the sourcing, training and certification of an adequate number of coaches and volunteers and also finding suitable areas for playing and practising.  It is interesting to note that currently a group of 60 girls practise and play regularly on a GAA pitch in Waterford.  We also have a number of examples of schools and community groups, sometimes in conjunction with their local sports partnerships, LSPs, and hockey clubs, taking up indoor hockey in local halls.  Ireland did in the recent past have quite a number of clubs and players playing indoor hockey.  This is an area that Hockey Ireland sees as a potential opportunity for developing the game and introducing it to new community groups of all ages.  Another creative initiative that started relatively recently is the concept of hockey for mums and hockey for dads.  Innovative clubs decided to provide the opportunity for parents to learn and play hockey, at their level, while waiting for their children to complete their training and practice sessions.  In some instances up to 60 adults availed of the chance to try the sport out and as a result started to get more embedded in the clubs and sport as a whole.  Most parishes across the country have access to an indoor hall that can be easily set up to accommodate hockey, thereby subverting the immediate need for expensive outdoor facilities to be developed.<\/p> <p>  The board of Hockey Ireland recently held a full-day session to finalise the strategic pillars for the sport over the next three to five years.  We were joined that day by representatives from Sport Ireland; the Olympic Federation of Ireland; members of the current senior men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s squads; a representative from our junior age group, JAG, teams; people representing the four provinces; Hockey Ireland staff; and, Hockey Ireland's European Hockey Federation representative.  Participation and development was one of the pillars that everyone agreed was key to our strategic development as a sport.  In fleshing out the pillar we called out the need to expand the geographic footprint of the sport, increase the number of players at all levels and all ages and broaden the number and skills of volunteers who are involved in hockey, be they coaches, umpires or administrators.  The consensus was that the main means that will help us to achieve this are collaboration with other sports organisations, local sports partnerships, schools and colleges and local communities, whereby they will provide the people resources be they players or volunteers and Hockey Ireland and the LSPs will work to provide the expertise and infrastructure to allow things to happen.  As an organisation and community, we believe we have much to contribute to a healthy and inspired Ireland.  We thank the Chairman and committee for their time and for affording us the opportunity to meet with them today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Jacob"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pels and Ms Jacob.

The programme in place for 2020 has allowed us to come together a lot more, but we must sacrifice how we live on a day-to-day basis to do that.

I do not think they put down that they won team of the year at the sports awards last year as well, which was another achievement.  I thank them for the opening statement.  There are things about the organisation that I had not realised, so it is very useful to get that context.  It would be very useful if the briefing document was included with the report that goes to Sport Ireland and the Minister because I found that very useful.  There would have been some questions that are answered in this so I thank the witnesses for pre-empting the questions in terms of how one breaks down the various provinces.  It is quite useful to benchmark that into the future regarding where the growth is.  It is nice to have that set as a base.<\/p> <p>  The all-Ireland aspect is very interesting.  It would be quite interesting to hear something about that such as how well that works.  Why would Hockey Ireland not get TV revenues if they are available?  Can something be done about this?  That is one of the dominant forms of income in some of the bigger sports where gate receipts are becoming a more diminished aspect of funding.  It would be interesting to see what is possible there and how that might work.<\/p> <p>  The success of the team has been a shop window for others to get involved.  I am not surprised that there was an upsurge after that.  That kind of mainstream coverage of the events is critically important.  It is quite amazing how women's sports tend to be the under-represented sports, but when they are put out there in a shop window, they are equally attractive.  There is a lesson there for people who are programming to make sure they are properly covered.<\/p> <p>  The other thing I wanted to ask about is VAT in sport.  Will the witnesses send us a note about the shortcomings and what could improve that?  Obviously, there is a differentiation between commercial sports played at professional level from which there is an income and the other side of it where people who are playing are trying to hold down jobs and fundraise at the same time.<\/p> <p>  I was really pleased to see attention paid to the governance - the boring governance aspect.

It is the first Irish team to reach a world cup final.  I watched the final, as most members probably did, or at least the highlights thereof.  It was a significant boost for women and women's sport as well as for hockey.  Women's participation in sport is the overarching theme of this meeting.  Some of the greatest figures in sport in Ireland currently are women.  I refer to Katie Taylor and Kelly Harrington who have reached the top of their sport, as well as Ellen Keane who competes in swimming in the Paralympics.  Without question, women who participate in sport can achieve at the highest level internationally.  The Irish women's cricket team has also performed very well.<\/p> <p>  The issue of television rights and coverage has been raised.  A survey carried out in the past year or two indicates that 12% of sports coverage comprises women's sport.  I was surprised the figure was that high.  Coverage online is between 3% and 4%.  The survey found that 58% of men and 64% thought there should be more coverage of women's sport.  Obviously, far more men than women think there is enough coverage of women's sport.  The standard argument is that if there is audience demand, the coverage will be offered.  It is a case of putting the cart before the horse.  The argument about audience and achievement is rendered meaningless by the US women's soccer team, which is more successful and draws bigger crowds than the US men's soccer team.  As members will be aware, chants demanding equal pay broke out throughout the stadium at the final of the women's soccer world cup.  They are pioneers on equal pay.  Usually, women in sport just look for something a bit better.  For example,the Irish women's soccer team was not looking for equal pay but, rather, for the players to be given tracksuits of their own.  The Irish women's hockey team has definitely added to the empowerment of women in sport.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in Ms Jacob's comment on hockey not being expensive.  I totally agree that one can play hockey without too much expense.  However, there is a class element to hockey relating to the schools in which it is played.  For example, I went to an all-girls school where one could play basketball but not hockey, whereas the boarding school next door offered hockey.  What is the reason for that class element?  Why does it persist?  It should be examined because the more people who play a sport, the better it will be.  I do not blame anyone involved in hockey for the class element but, rather, point out that we should examine it because there would be a higher participation rate if it was offered more widely.  Similarly, it is not expensive to study ballet.  It is less expensive to take ballet lessons than Irish dancing lessons but there is a certain elitism that persists in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  I again congratulate the team on its achievement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#J00400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1112,"content":"<p>I play for a club based in Tallaght, which is not a highly recognised hockey catchment area.

It is easy to deliver but we need the people to deliver it as we cannot get around all the schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Hanaphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1118,"content":"<p>That is a question of linking up with the teachers involved in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#K00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>That is right, and perhaps teaching them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Hanaphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>There could be some sort of website and if they thought they would love to do it, they could get involved.

For all of us who are passionate about sport, these were two special moments with the team's qualification for the world cup when no one expected it, breaking the glass ceiling, and there was the Sunday night some months ago in the terrible weather during dramatic circumstances which were incredible.  Watching the team's sheer joy in its celebrations on the pitch afterwards brought a smile to the nation.  For many years, I have said that sport can do that and no other sector can - certainly politics cannot anyway.  The agonising defeat of the men the previous week showed how thin a line there is between victory and defeat.  It can be millimetres between agony and ecstasy.  Today's presentation has mentioned governance and so on.  The team is on a wonderful journey.  Ironically, it had to make its own success before the goodwill came, and the acknowledgement and the recognition, but that makes it all the sweeter.  The narrow dramatic victories in shoot-outs, after going 3-1 down, is heaven on earth.  Well done to the team on that.<\/p> <p>  I will not cover the question of TV rights again.  The reaction to the team's success and its uplift has been mentioned.  The figures are before me.  I am from Connacht where there are only nine clubs.  Was there an uplift or have any new clubs been formed in the provinces as a result?  The idea that there is a sustainable future with underage teams has been mentioned.  Are there international underage competitions for development squads?  <\/p> <p>  The increasing cost of insurance was mentioned.  That is a very topical issue in every aspect of life.

Being an Olympian is an honour bestowed on very few, no matter what the result.  I am delighted to hear of a hockey team using a GAA pitch.  It is not something that is provided for in the rules of the association.  Kenmare had a hockey team for a while, which used a synthetic grass pitch, which was okay because it is only a training pitch so that is within the rules of the association.<\/p><p>We have bendable rules in the GAA at times in Kerry.  We actually had London Irish playing on the pitch at one stage in 2001.  The whole committee almost got hung, drawn and quartered for that particular outing.<\/p><p> I wanted to ask a question on pensions.  This is relevant for rowing too and I note Sanita Puspure, who is one of our Olympians as well, was before the committee previously.  She pointed out that her pension contribution, like that of many others, will not be at its maximum level.  Her pension is not being assisted by the State.  This is a really technical point.  Is there anything Hockey Ireland would like members to say on its behalf to the Minister on that point when he is before the committee next week?  While no one on the deputation is near pension age, it is something that affects many minority sports people and others playing sports, including rugby and soccer.  It affects them because they are unable to contribute.  Nothing is being put in on their behalf by the State.  That is something we should address.<\/p><p> Another point relates to passports.  This is a bugbear of mine.  We had this with Cricket Ireland as well.  I was trying to get clarification on this for Hockey Ireland.  There are approximately 64 all-Ireland sports teams and associations.  My view is that no one should be required to have a particular passport when playing in Ireland.  It is a requirement in cricket.  It is not a requirement of Cricket Ireland but of the European Cricket Council.  A player must have a passport of the country for whom he is playing.  Obviously, given our unique circumstances, I do not believe that should be a requirement in Ireland.  Again, that may be an argument this committee could make on behalf of hockey players.  Identity is a major issue and we do not want it to be an issue for someone playing for the team.<\/p><p> The Minister is coming before the committee next week.  Thankfully, it is not because of the hockey players or their association.  Is there something Hockey Ireland would like us to say to the Minister?  He made an announcement of &euro;1 million.  That was somewhat overstating the case.  What share of that has Hockey Ireland seen?  What share does the association require?  Having done quite a public relations job for himself on that occasion, the Minister deserves to have to deliver on his fine words and promise.  Is the cheque still in the post?  What cheque should we be asking him for next week?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#K01800","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1135,"content":"<p>The question of pension contributions may be technical but it is true of course that elite athletes basically postpone their career to a significant extent and therefore regular employment income.  That would be a good point to look into.<\/p> <p>  The question of passports is interesting.  I need to say this right.  The passport question is important because of the rules that govern international representative teams.  The rules are in place to protect us because otherwise many countries would basically shop for talent.  The passport rule in the world of sport is recognised as being a good rule.  Even internationally and at International Olympic Committee level there are rules and stipulations to the effect that a person cannot change passport at the drop of a hat.  There is a four-year waiting time.  That is to ensure people do not simply go to the country that pays the most or offers other benefits.  In that sense the rule helps.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be clear: to play hockey at national level - to play for a club - there is no requirement for passports, so there is no concern about that.  In fact, that is a regular occurrence in our sport.  We have Irish players who play in Europe at club level.  They are playing for different clubs in national competitions.  In theory, a person of any nationality could play for clubs in Ireland as well.  When a player represents a country, the passport becomes an issue or is subject to the rule.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Pels"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>It comes from the International Hockey Federation.

Much has been said already and I do not intend to repeat any questions.  I want to pick up on some points made in the opening statement and flesh them out.<\/p> <p>  The first point arises from an infrastructural point of view.  How many employees does Hockey Ireland have?  What is the aspiration when it comes to development officers?  People have talked about broadening the sport in places like Connacht or in the wider society.  However, we have seen from other sports the importance of development officers and co-ordinating with physical education teachers who want to bring in the sport and work with local sports partnerships.  What is the strategy for rolling out, as Dublin GAA did for hurling and camogie ten or 20 years ago?  How can that be replicated?<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe touched on infrastructure and pitch access.  It is great to hear about the new clubs in Tipperary working with facilities in Waterford but hockey pitches are expensive.  I am not only talking about the national stadium, UCD or the temporary pitch that was so brilliantly used by the Irish hockey team in Energia Park.  I have in mind the standard pitch that will run through the day as well.  My constituency is something of a hotbed for hockey.  Two clubs have a waiting list for every girls team from junior infants up to under-16 level.  That is simply because there is insufficient pitch time.  I have spoken to people playing hockey in Australia.  They say they have training sessions at 11 p.m. or midnight.  That may be because it is 40oC during the day but it is a matter of being inventive, as well as being cognisant of planning conditions that only allow floodlights to be on until 10 p.m.<\/p> <p>  The final point has been brushed on briefly by everyone.  It relates specifically to the current players and concern about player welfare.  It is not a professional sport.  How does a player balance becoming an Olympian and playing at elite level with a day job or college?  What is involved in the average day?  What support do the players get from Hockey Ireland?  What if the employer is not sympathetic?  What about family members?  The Hockey Ireland representatives referred to the goal for the hockey league and television rights or aspirations to be online.  Many players have been playing abroad recently, including those on the Irish team.  They have played on the Continent or under collegiate system in the USA.  I assume the aspiration, like other sports, is to have every Irish international playing in Ireland around the clock.  How can that be achieved?  What is afoot to try to achieve that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#L00700","speaker":"1399"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1576022400,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>At the moment the number of employees we have is at 17 or 18.

Following the success in the World Cup and with help from Park Developments, SoftCo and Sport Ireland, we have been able to become a bit more semi-professional since July.  That has been a major driver in getting players to return home.  Five of us were playing abroad last year and we are all back in Ireland now playing on a semi-professional basis.<\/p> <p>  Regarding balancing with work, I have recently started working in a job two days a week.  The coverage we have got over the past two years has made companies and employers buy into our story and they allow us a bit more flexibility.

Some organisations are not making them available to women, which shows the inequality women are facing in sports.  There is no requirement on organisations that are given money.

I previously dealt with senior management in the Coast Guard about the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island and a previous draft report, referred to as the Feron report, which contained scathing criticism of senior management in the Irish Coast Guard service was uncovered by the community group in Valentia.  That report went to senior management in the Coast Guard and all of the criticism of senior management was taken out of the report.  The final report that went to the relevant Minister at the time, Deputy Varadkar, contained no criticism of senior management.  It should be borne in mind that this was years ago.  That was a second attempt to close the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island by giving false information to a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, in the first instance, and, subsequently, to a Fine Gael Minister.<\/p> <p>  There are issues relating to Rescue 116, including the faulty information that it had, rosters and so on in the information we have available to us.  I have information about life jackets and have asked for the correspondence without, and within, the Department.  My information is that the Coast Guard was aware those jackets were faulty when Coast Guard volunteer, Caitriona Lucas, died in Clare.  Senior management was aware that those life jackets were not deploying on impact with water.  While that may not have been the reason that lady passed away, the life jacket did not deploy.  There are allegations that jackets were changed and the life jacket Ms Lucas was supposed to be wearing was not the one she was wearing.  I take all of that with a pinch of salt but, on top of that, there were questions about the procurement of lifeboats of questionable origin and over the use of cars and jeeps.<\/p> <p>  The Feron report, although not an official report, said senior management was critically flawed.  Everything that has happened since should be considered in the light of that draft report stating how bad senior management in the Coast Guard was.  That report dates back to 2007.  Looking at everything that has happened since, the original report was correct and the senior management in the Coast Guard is costing lives, as we saw with the tragedy of Rescue 116 and the life jacket of Caitriona Lucas.  I have asked for the correspondence because my information is that there was a lot of stuff going on about the procurement of equipment by senior management who were also at the back end of the companies that were supplying that equipment.  That is secondary to the fact that people are losing their lives.<\/p> <p>  When the report into Rescue 116 is available, the whole senior management of the Coast Guard and the Secretary General or assistant secretary should be brought before the committee and asked about those life jackets.  We also want to know about the procurement process for the life jackets because concerns were raised prior to their purchase.  I want to put to those representatives that there was a reason they purchased those life jackets and we should be concerned about that, even though they are only allegations.  We should try and get to the bottom of that so I ask members of the committee that when the report on the tragedy of Rescue 116 is available - and please God it will be available before a general election - we bring the whole lot of them in on all of those issues, including Rescue 116, life jackets and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#P00800","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1213,"content":"<p>We want all that correspondence in the interim.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#P00900","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1214,"content":"<p>That would be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#P01000","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>The clerk to the committee has requested that.

The Committee of Public Accounts is also examining that matter but, given it concerns the RSA, it also falls under the remit of this committee.  I did not realise the RSA has &euro;25 million in the bank.  That is a serious amount.  It has &euro;25 million in the bank while charging &euro;72 million per year to people who are trying to export goods out of the country.  The authority does not need all that money.<\/p> <p>  Hauliers have stated that the RSA is looking to consolidate power.  This is why I asked for the regulatory impact assessment.  This also affects the Chairman's constituency.  The current testing system for hauliers means that if a haulier wants to bring a truck for testing, he or she can ring a local CVRT person with whom they have a relationship.  The tester is not going to pass the vehicle because he or she knows the haulier, but the haulier can drop the truck in at 11 o'clock at night when it is back from its journey.  That might shift to an amalgamated system because the RSA wants to put it out for tender and have one body to do it all, as is the case for car testing.  When the road hauliers asked senior management of the RSA if they would be allowed to take the trailer on the truck to a tester at 11 p.m. or 6 a.m., they were told they would not.  If there is a flaw with a truck, for example a brake pad is required on one wheel, hauliers are currently allowed by the operators of test centres to bring in their own mechanic and fix it on site.  That would no longer be the case.<\/p><p>They would have to go to the cost of bringing in a truck to haul it away, which is hundreds of euro.  That is why I asked that, before the RSA goes off and puts this out to public tender for one system, while we are all in pre-election mode and when we might put something in front of a Minister and say \"sign that\", we should ask it not to do any of that until it gives us a regulatory impact assessment on the impact on the average road haulier of its proposed system.<\/p><p> Another point, which is way more serious is that, based on information the RSA gave to Deputy Robert Troy, the level of testing it does on foreign registered trucks is minuscule - by its own admission, it is 5% to 8% - whereas the estimated proportion of foreign registered trucks, although the RSA does not know it exactly, is about 30%, or possibly higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2019121100002#P01800","speaker":"1414","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576022400,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>The Senator is raising serious issues.

If it is in order, given Senator Daly has had a fair run and nobody is fighting with him over this, I propose that we ask the RSA management not just to send on the regulatory impact statement but to come to the committee to discuss it.
