On behalf of the ComReg, I welcome the opportunity to appear.  I am joined today, as the Chairman mentioned, by my fellow commissioners, Mr. Jeremy Godfrey and Mr. Robert Mourik, and my colleague, Donal Leavy, director of the wholesale division.  This is my first opportunity to appear before the committee in my capacity as chair of ComReg.  Mr. Mourik and I only joined the organisation in January, but Mr. Godfrey has been with the organisation for the past six years so he is an old hand.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, ComReg is the national regulatory authority for electronic communications.  We promote competition and investment in the sector, uphold end user rights and manage the radio spectrum.<\/p><p>In our recently published strategy statement, we have confirmed our vision for the sector that consumers and businesses in Ireland have affordable, high-quality and widespread access to communications services and applications that support their social and economic needs.  Our role in achieving this vision is to ensure that communications markets operate effectively in the interests of end users and society.  In recent years, predictable and proportionate regulation has created an environment which has led to investment in high-speed broadband networks covering three quarters of the premises in the State.  At the same time, there has been an increasing choice of service providers.  In the coming years, operators plan to make effective direct fibre connections to most of the premises I mentioned.  There are, however, parts of the State where the population density is lower and high-speed broadband would not be a viable commercial investment.  Consumers and businesses in these areas have not benefited equally.  That is why we welcome the Government's national broadband plan, NBP, which will address this market failure and result in the availability of high-speed broadband to all.<\/p><p> ComReg has two roles in respect of the NBP.  First, we have significant technical and regulatory expertise and have been advised the Government on matters in respect of which this expertise is relevant.  Second, we are the independent regulator of the market.  This includes regulation of certain products that National Broadband Ireland, NBI, may require as inputs to its network.  We are happy to provide more details to the committee, as needed, about ComReg's role to date and in the future.  As we stated in our letter to the committee, however, ComReg has no specific legal functions in determining the roll-out time or in respect of value-for-money or ownership issues.  To date, our primary role as adviser to the Government has been in respect of issues highlighted in the European Commission's state aid guidelines.  More specifically, we have been consulted on the approach taken to define the intervention area to ensure that the NBP does not distort competition in commercially viable areas.  We have also advised on requirements to ensure that the NBP wholesale intervention facilitates an open competitive market among retail service providers that will be selling broadband services in the intervention area.  This has involved matters such as wholesale product design and pricing, access and non-discrimination obligations and enforcement approaches, all of which are very similar to the issues we consider in our regulatory role in respect of Eir's wholesale broadband products.<\/p><p> In connection with the Government's state aid application, and in response to a request from the European Commission, we confirmed in writing last year that we have been consulted on all matters where state aid guidelines recommend consultation with the national regulatory authority, NRA, including, in particular, pricing and the mapping exercise carried out under the guidelines.  We expressed the opinion to the European Commission that the Department has considered our views on such matters.  We confirmed to it that, based on the information available, there were no issues arising from the consultation process that ComReg wished to bring to the attention of the Commission.<\/p><p> The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment established an expert working group, of which ComReg was a member, in order to provide detailed technical and regulatory advice, and detailed technical questions were discussed.  ComReg also attended the Department's steering group as an observer.  The steering group acts as an advisory body and the Minister is the ultimate decision maker.  ComReg did not participate in the steering group's decision-making.<\/p><p> We should add that ComReg had no role in advising on policy matters such as value for money or prioritisation of the NBP within the Government's expenditure plans.  We were not involved in the procurement process and played no role in assessing the proposed roll-out timelines, ownership structures or financial capability of the bidders.  We were not involved in the preparation of the cost-benefit analysis.  That was carried out by others.  These matters are properly the responsibility of Government and its spending Departments rather than an independent regulator with a defined statutory role.<\/p><p> In our role as independent regulator, we established a mechanism for interested parties to pose questions about current and possible future regulation where appropriate.  We have published our responses to these questions on our website.  These have covered issues such as access to Eir's ducts and poles and the possible applicability of significant market power and universal service obligations after the NBP network is complete.<\/p><p>We have also taken the initiative to share our early thinking on the retirement of the copper network once fibre-based services are available.<\/p><p> For the future, it is possible that ComReg could play a role in advising the Minister or his or her representative on certain post-contract governance matters to the extent within ComReg's expertise, primarily involving the issues on which we have been advising to date, such as product design and non-discriminatory access for retail service providers.  The precise scope of any role for ComReg will be determined by the Government in due course.<\/p><p> We will also continue to provide independent regulation of the sector during and beyond the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP, infrastructure.  Regulatory matters relevant to the NBP might include duct and pole access, the application of the significant market power regime, universal service obligations and the upholding of the rights of consumers of retail service providers.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear today and to make this statement.  We are happy to take questions members may have arising from our statement and follow up with written responses on anything we cannot cover specifically today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Garrett Blaney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Blaney.

Last year, when preparing an assignment process for spectrum, which includes one of the spectrum bands identified in Europe as a pioneer band for 5G, we did a study on the connectivity needs of users.  The conclusion was that mobile and fixed services are complementary in ensuring the needs of end users are met.  For a number of reasons, we do not believe 4G or 5G mobile networks can meet the objectives of the national broadband plan.  We modelled a number of scenarios, the most aggressive of which was 99.5% population coverage including a 30 Mbps service to a single user at the edge of the cell.  This would require almost double the number of cell sites that mobile networks have at present, which would be very expensive to put in place and would take a long time.  We are all aware of some of the difficulties mobile operators have in finding cell sites.  Even the coverage we modelled would not guarantee indoor connectivity, only outdoor connectivity.  Many of the more remote premises covered by the national broadband plan would require additional equipment to ensure the signal could be received indoors.  End users of a mobile network could not be guaranteed the same consistent high-quality experience.  The modelling we did was for a single user at the cell edge.  Providing capacity if everybody in the coverage area was streaming video every evening would be another kettle of fish entirely.  Even the very expensive additional mobile network coverage would not be sufficient to meet the objectives of the NBP.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question on the amount of fibre, one of the deployment scenarios for 5G involves what are called small cells.  Our modelling was based on the large macro cells with equipment on towers and masts.  There is a deployment scenario whereby the cell size is a few hundred metres or so.  This has been designed for deployment in urban environments with a big density of demand.  To deploy it in rural environments would require fibre backhaul from each small cell.<\/p><p>If one were to put a number of small cell sites along a rural road, one would still need to have fibre along the road to handle the backhaul from those sites.  The expense would be much higher and the signals could still be blocked by, for example, foliage and rain.<\/p><p> I will make another point about 5G and 4G.  As well as their use in mobile networks, radio technologies can be used for fixed wireless connections.  There is potential in the use of wireless in fixed wireless mode to serve selected hard-to-reach premises.  However, mobile broadband would not be a solution.  Fixed wireless broadband could form part of a solution but only selectively.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about examining 5G deployment in other countries.  There is none really, save for very small trial deployments in the United States where suburban fixed wireless broadband is being used.  They are in environments where there is a much greater demand density than is found in the rural premises served by the NBP; therefore, they are not relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I wish to ask a number of questions.  The committee has previously discussed the 300,000 premises being covered by Eir.  My understanding is Eir is charging a wholesale connection rate of approximately &euro;170 per connection, with a further charge of &euro;170 where someone switches.  Can ComReg do anything about this?  When the NBP is rolled out, there will be an initial &euro;100 sign-up fee and no charge for switching.  The delegates might supply us with some information on the matter.  It appears that existing customers will be at a disadvantage versus those in the intervention areas.  Is there any way to standardise the charges?<\/p> <p>  I understand the regulated part of Eir's fixed-line business is showing profits in excess of 50%.  That figure makes Eir stand out as probably one of the most profitable incumbents in the world and certainly in Europe.  What does that tell ComReg about the extent of its regulatory regime's effectiveness in addressing wholesale charges which also cover poles and ducts?  This will have an impact on charges under the NBP.  From some of the recent information provided, we were led to believe that approximately &euro;1 billion of the supposed &euro;3 billion cost associated with the NBP would go to Eir to pay for access to its ducts and poles.  As such, a profit of 50% seems excessive, but perhaps the delegates might speak about it.  Eir announced a reduction of 20% or so in operating costs in this quarter.  Is the reduction being reflected in the price to the customer and will it be reflected in a reduction in pole and duct charges?  The delegates might have a view on that matter.<\/p> <p>  Recently Eir announced to the market that it had refinanced its debt at a figure of 3.5%.  Essentially, shareholders converted equity into debt by adding more debt to the company's books.  ComReg allows Eir to earn approximately 8% on its cost of capital.  There seems to be something of a mismatch between Eir's cost of capital and its real costs.  This would have an impact on the cost of the NBP.  Do the delegates have a view on the matter?<\/p> <p>  I will turn to an area that has been covered somewhat by the Chairman.  Mr. Godfrey captured some of it in his response.  In trying to understand what the best model for a network in the intervention area should be, there is a view that what has been offered by Granahan McCourt is effectively 100% fibre coverage for the 542,000 premises.  That is having an impact on the roll-out.  It was a shock to many consumers in the intervention area that it would take between seven and ten years to get broadband.  Is it possible for some of the roll-out to be done using fibre and fixed wireless broadband?<\/p><p>I understand fully what is being said regarding 4G and 5G from a mobile perspective.  There is also the issue of the deployment of fixed wireless in some locations.  Has any modelling been done on providing broadband in the intervention area based on a sliding scale of, say, 70% fibre to homes with 30% fixed wireless, or a variation thereof, that would hit the sweet spot in respect of cost and roll out?  I know there are issues with fixed wireless.  There are issues with fibre to the cabinet at the moment for those of us who have to suffer that.  There is not a definite solution for everybody.  Is it possible to look at a mixture of fibre and fixed wireless that will achieve the optimum outcome for the consumer, while reaching the minimum standard of 30 Mbps?  Someone with a child about to enter primary school today could be waiting until after that child completes his or her leaving certificate before a fibre connection will be provided.  Instead of potentially waiting for a decade, those people might instead accept a fixed wireless solution which could be deployed in two or three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#L00200","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The witnesses can address those questions in any order they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#M00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1559689200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We will try to deal with the questions in sequence.

Mr. Mourik will then address the general approach we are taking for the pricing of the poles and ducts.

Some members might remember that this was a bone of contention when I was last before the committee in October.  We made a decision on this issue in December.  Prior to that, Eir was charging &euro;270 for connections to the fibre to the home, FTTH, network.  The decision we made gives Eir a great deal of flexibility in how it prices its wholesale product.  Regarding the issue of fibre to the cabinet, that is now a more mature network.  The demand is more certain and we know what the deployment costs are.  We moved in December to what is called a cost orientation obligation where we determined what price Eir should be allowed to charge for that network.  The fibre to the home network is new and therefore it is much harder to accurately predict the take-up of demand.  We share that difficulty with our colleagues across Europe.  There are also more uncertainties about the cost of deployment.  It is, therefore, much more risky and difficult to set a fixed price.<\/p> <p>  We are taking a margin squeeze approach to Eir.  The company has the freedom to choose its wholesale prices.  It has to ensure, however, that there is enough space between the wholesale price and the retail price to allow companies such as Sky Ireland, Vodafone and other resellers to be able to compete effectively.  We took the view that Eir should not have complete freedom to set the connection charge.  We felt that the company's previous approach of having a very high upfront connection charge had the potential to have anti-competitive effects.  We made a decision, therefore, to give Eir the freedom to choose the connection charge, subject to two constraints.  One was that it should charge the same for a new connection as for a migration.  That was intended to ensure that there was no distortion of the incentives for resellers.  We did not want them waiting until somebody else had the disadvantage of paying for the connection and then coming along and trying to churn the customers.  We wanted to ensure there was no distortion between new customers and existing customers.  The second approach we took was to stipulate that the amount of money that Eir could recover through those upfront charges should, over the lifetime of the asset, be no greater than the cost of building the last connection to the premises of the end user.  Based on Eir's costs and its average customer lifetime, the company proposed a price of &euro;170.  We scrutinised its proposal but we do not approve the company's prices.<\/p><p>It is the company's responsibility to comply with regulation and we certainly did not see any need to intervene.  As the Deputy stated, the Government has taken a slightly different approach in deciding how the wholesale connection charges for the national broadband plan should be arranged.  The &euro;170 will not, as a matter of practice, be passed in full to end users.  The retail connection charge is also &euro;100 in the area with the 300,000 premises being connected.  As a result of the way the regulation works, the reseller can amortise that &euro;170 over the average 42-month customer lifetime.  It amounts to approximately &euro;4 per month so the resellers can charge &euro;100 upfront and recover the remaining &euro;70 over the 42 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The customer still gets hit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#N00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1559689200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The customer is only paying &euro;100.

Of course it is a private asset and there needs to be some compensation or payment made for access to it but &euro;20 seems excessive.  People are rightly concerned that the total amount of taxpayers' money going to a private company for the duration of this contract is &euro;1 billion, considering that Eir will have access to the fibre to sell services through to the end user, but that is a separate issue.

First, as long as Eir remains <i>in situ<\/i>in these areas and is sharing these poles with the NBP company the current rule is quite simple - we split the cost 50-50.  Instead of being &euro;20 per annum, it will be &euro;10 per annum.  That is one observation.  It is quite possible over time that Eir's legacy copper network will be technically inferior to a fibre-to-the-home network.  As a result, I do not know how long Eir will remain <i>in situ<\/i>in terms of it providing services.  Ultimately, somebody has to pay for those poles because there will be a reinvestment rate.  From experience of Eir's footprint in respect of the 300,000 premises, we know that quite a number of poles had to be replaced.  They have to be paid for by somebody.  It is inescapable that there must be some charge.  I will not speculate too much now on how that is to be calculated because we will possibly make proposals on that later this year and I do not want to say anything that would pre-empt what we might do.  In principle, there is a cost.  There is a cost in installing, maintaining and replacing poles.  There are some operating costs and so forth.  If Eir is incurring these costs and this is done incurred efficiently, by law it is entitled to some compensation.  There is no way around that.<br\/><br\/>We are examining this matter.  As Mr. Mourik stated, we are looking at what the price of the poles should be in the intervention area.  Should it be the same as the standard &euro;20 mentioned, divided by two into &euro;10 or are there reasons it would vary?  Are there operational efficiencies one could achieve because the scale is so large?  Are there procurement efficiencies?  On the other hand, will the reinvestment rate into new poles be different from that which Eir has been employing up to now?  All these things work in various directions so it is hard to speculate how it will land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Leavy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1559689200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I wish to stress that this is a maximum rate.

He asked if it is possible to optimise the mix of fibre and fixed wireless.  That is fundamentally a matter for NBI and the Government to work out.  The Government has a service standard that is required in the tender process.  The mix of technologies used to meet the standard is not something that ComReg has modelled.  However, I can provide a little more information because two years ago we completed an assignment of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band.  That spectrum is useful for 5G in urban contexts but is also useful for fixed wireless in rural contexts.  We made sure that we brought forward and progressed that spectrum award so that bidders in the NBP procurement would have the opportunity to buy that spectrum if they thought it was going to be useful.  We also assigned that spectrum on a regional basis with some rural lots and some urban lots so that options were available.<\/p> <p>  What happened is that there is at least one operator deploying fixed wireless using that spectrum on a commercial basis in rural areas.  I take this personally because my family home is in north Cork, 5 km from the nearest village.<\/p><p>I am fortunate enough to be able to see the mast from my house so I have quite a good broadband service; it is much better than I ever had when it was provided on the copper network.  My neighbours keep saying that they cannot see the mast because of the topography and the location of the trees.  I actually put a repeater on my chimney for one of my neighbours in order that they can get service.  That illustrates both the potential and also the difficulties of using fixed wireless in these areas.  What the optimum choice to be made by NBI in rolling out its network will be is unclear.  Many people have been working with the Government on the network design.  For some lucky customers, there is the potential to get services from commercial operators.  It is certainly a possibility but the optimum mix is not something that ComReg has a mandate to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I have a final supplementary question on that issue.

This is an enormous job of work.  When one looks at the structure of this project and design of the tender, as outlined in documents released by the Department, as well as at how the contract will work, it is clear that there is a lot of regulation to be done.  ComReg is going to be busy but it was already under pressure regarding staff.  I do not think there is any dispute about that.  ComReg has been operating with less than one quarter of the staff that it needs to fulfil its regulatory duties.  The commission has made a number of pleas to the Department, according to freedom of information data, seeking additional staff.  When we ask questions of the Minister or of senior officials, we are told that ComReg is looking after this and that it is going to regulate it.  There is an awful lot of weight being put on the commission's shoulders.  I am saying this in an effort to set the scene here.<\/p> <p>  We have been asking questions about how this is going to be monitored because it is a very precarious structure, to put it mildly.  It is going to be very difficult to manage and monitor but, according to the Minister, ComReg will ensure that this is adequately monitored and regulated.<\/p><p>Has ComReg received guarantees from the Minister, the Department or the Government that it will receive adequate finance to do this?  If not, will Mr. Blaney outline the concern in respect of his responsibility because I have many replies to the questions put to this Minister or the previous Minister in charge of putting broadband in place saying that everything will be fine because ComReg is looking after the public interest.<br\/><br\/>Second, in respect of the NDP, the public is looking at this project and saying that the risk for the investor is &euro;180 million.  A number of other risks have emerged over the past three or four years and even in the past 12 months in respect of this project but, from the investor's point of view, the &euro;1 billion will go to another private company - Eir.  The reason Eir has to be paid is it holds the trump card because it has a monopoly on the network because it controls most of the network.  It comprises Eir's poles, ducting and outside of the MANs, it owns almost everything else in terms of getting around the highways and byways and between towns, villages and cities.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Fergal Mulligan, the programme director from the Department appeared before the committee on 22 May and stated:<\/p><blockquote>ComReg is 100% responsible for whether we [the taxpayer] pay &euro;900 million, &euro;800 million or slightly more.  If ComReg were to determine that the pole and duct prices should be slightly more,  we have factored that into our contingency.... <\/blockquote><p>In light of that how does Mr. Blaney intend to regulate the prices?  The subsidy to Eir could be &euro;36 million a year.  The public is looking at the sheer amount involved, with up to &euro; 1 billion of taxpayer's money is going to a private entity, which was purchased by a French investor.  We are, therefore, going to pay an entity owned by an American investor to pay the French investor for permission to hang cables on its poles and put some cables through its ducting. <br\/><br\/>I understand the predicament ComReg is in.  It is not a nice one to be landed with, but how does it intend to manage this and what bargaining power has it?  The private investors who own Eir hold all the cards.  ComReg may under the utility regulations say to them that the company has to give its officials access, but it can make it damn awkward for anybody else.  ComReg is caught arbitrating between two private entities owned by a French investor and American investor and it is going to give an ass and cart load of taxpayer's money one investor to buy off the other so that the public can have this service.  How does the regulator do that, given that it is dealing with two monopolies? What bargaining power has it?

In the case of a residential home it is set at &euro;30 per month per subscriber.  This is an entirely regulated business.  <\/blockquote> <p>Will ComReg confirm the role it played in the decision to charge &euro;30 per month?  What is that based on?<\/p><p>As I recall it, when ComReg issued its regulation on a wholesale access price for broadband last November, it set the price at &euro;19.54 per house.  Why is the contract now stating it will be &euro;30?  What control will ComReg have over the figure of &euro;30 in the future?  Is it index-linked?  Although I know Mr. Blaney will say it has certain powers, the key flaw in all of this is that ComReg is dealing with a monopoly.  If the contract for the NBP plan goes in the direction in which the Government is driving it, the monopoly will have full control of the NBP network.  As Mr. Blaney said in his opening remarks, \"For the future, it is possible that ComReg could play a role in advising the Minister or his or her representative on certain post-contract governance matters to the extent within ComReg's expertise.\"  He went on to mention some of the issues involved.<\/p><p> The board of National Broadband Ireland will have nine members.  ComReg represents the public interest which we are supposed to be representing.  That is why we are having this useful conversation.  Eight people on the board will represent the American investor which will, as we have learned, invest between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million in the early days of the process.  The taxpayer who will put in up to &euro;3 billion in the early years of the process will be represented by one person.  ComReg's interests, our interests and those of the people will be represented by one person.  The loyalty of the others on the board of the corporate entity, National Broadband Ireland, will be to the company.  When I asked for clarification on this matter in recent weeks, I was told that they would be appointed by the investor.  One person and one person only will be appointed by the Minister to represent the taxpayer.  The point I am making relates to how these matters will be overseen.  ComReg will regulate it.  If the single soul who will be on the board has the will to stand up and thump or kick the table at a meeting, he or she will be completely outvoted.  He or she will have little or no say, no authority and no power to try to put the brakes on if it goes off in a certain direction.  <\/p><p> I have asked my three questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#R00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Mr. Blaney can reply in any order to the questions that have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#S00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1559689200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I will answer the first question before asking Mr. Mourik to provide clarity on access to poles and ducts.

The nub of his question is whether we can guarantee that a company such as Eir which has all of those poles will provide access.

As I pointed out in response to Deputy Dooley, we have prices in the market for access to the poles and are looking at whether they need to be revised.  It is to be hoped we can consult on that matter later this year.  Under these powers, we can request information from Eir and dig deep into what the costs should be before we set anything.  We have very strong legal powers.<\/p> <p>  A second important aspect is the more functional requirements of pole and duct access.  In November last year we issued a new decision about the manner in which Eircom must give access to poles and ducts.  The decision is quite detailed, but in summary, there are now very detailed provisions to ensure Eircom will provide access to its ducts and poles in exactly the same manner as it uses them.  For example, it has just rolled out fibre to the home in the 300,000 area.  It must give the same access to any party.  We have ensured the provisions and obligations we put on Eircom are in line with best practice in Europe.  It is not just a matter of having these legal powers.  We have made pricing decisions surrounding functioning access.  It is now a matter of following through.  In this case, National Broadband Ireland can apply for access with Eir.

Many poles throughout the country are falling over and some have collapsed into ditches.  However - hey presto - in recent months new poles have been installed.

I will provide a little bit of background on that.  The key product we are discussing here is virtual unbundled access, VUA.  This is the high-speed broadband connection between the customer premises and the local hand-over point, which in the Eircom network will be the local telephone exchange.  A retail service provider can either provide its own backhaul from the exchange or it can buy a bundle of the VUA products together with backhaul.  Back in December ComReg finished a review of the wholesale local access market, of which VUA is the key product.  As part of that we set a price, as the Deputy has mentioned, for VUA provided over fibre to the cabinet, FTTC, infrastructure.  This is the &euro;19.54 price referred to by the Deputy.  It is for fibre to the cabinet.  As I said earlier, we did not set a fixed price for VUA provided to the home infrastructure, which is the 300,000 premises.  Eircom has also announced that it is planning to roll out a much more extensive fibre to the home infrastructure in the areas where it currently has fibre to the cabinet infrastructure.  We did not set a fixed price for that and have given Eir pricing flexibility for the reasons I have mentioned.  As well as the difficulties in setting a price, it also gives Eir the possibility to choose a pricing approach that is best calculated to drive penetration on that network.  I can inform the committee that the prices do not have a single price for fibre to the home product.

Deputy Eamon Ryan asked the Minister whether it was index linked and the Minister said he would come back to the committee with more information about that.  The Department's synopsis of the contract refers to detailed price control mechanisms, but as it has not disclosed in detail what those mechanisms are, it is not possible for me to go beyond them.  I refer to the precise way in which benchmarking to the market is carried out.  Although the price is not set by ComReg, it is set in the context of a regulated market, so exactly how that price is chosen is a matter for the Department, as I said.  The Deputy will see that it is within the range of prices that Eir charges in the context of the regulation we put in place.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked us what our role might be in the future.  Again, this depends on how the contract finally turns out.  As the Department has said, there are detailed rules to control the prices and how they will evolve over time.  To the extent that ComReg has information, insights or technical expertise that are useful to the Minister or are representative in applying those provisions of the contract, then it would be natural for ComReg to be asked to provide that advice, input or expertise.  Subject to us having the appropriate statutory mandate and resources to do that, we would be happy to do so.  As Mr. Blaney said, the resource conversation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Finance has resulted in us getting the resources we required for our day-to-day business, which includes the resources we would need for continuing wholesale regulation under the significant market power regime, which includes the continuing scrutiny of the duct and pole price.  That is just part of business as usual for us.  It is not specifically national broadband plan related, although it is relevant.

I want to ask Mr. Godfrey about this issue of what percentage of fixed wireless might be appropriate.  I know he avoided saying that ComReg came to a conclusion on that but my understanding is that the Government is indicating less than 2% or around 2% in the national broadband plan.  Many people in the industry or people with knowledge of the sector think that what we are doing here is gold plating and that, as Mr. Godfrey says, we have the technology and the spectrum to carry out fixed wireless solutions.  While one's neighbours in north Cork might have difficulty, a person would know straight away whether he or she can connect from a mast to a house by line of sight or otherwise.  Does Mr. Godfrey not have a view on what the percentage would be?  The fixed wireless does meet all the technical specifications the Government is looking for in its deployment.  ComReg is there to protect the consumer.  As Deputy Dooley says, it may well be in the consumer's interest to have fixed wireless.  It has the advantage that it can be deployed more quickly.  Has ComReg not done an assessment of what the percentage might be with fixed wireless and what the capabilities would be?  Let us look at it as a capability within the national broadband scheme area first of all.

One of the problems with fixed wireless is that it is difficult to see it being used as a comprehensive solution in any geographical area because of these line of sight issues.  Even though I can get it, my neighbour may not be able to.  If my neighbour is going to be served with fibre, they may as well serve me with fibre as well.  It has not been our role to do that detailed planning but we are not surprised that the choice has been to use fibre.  The Deputy also talked about the technical characteristics.  Fixed wireless can certainly provide a good service.  It tends to be a contended service so it could become overloaded if it was used to try to provide universal service to everybody in an area.  The other issue with wireless is the requirement for future-proofing.  Fibre is certainly better able to meet the requirements because the upgrading of the speeds and capability of fibre can be done merely by changing some of the equipment at the end.

For example, while the electronic equipment is certainly much cheaper per unit than it was 20 years ago and thus the cost of transmission per megabit much lower, the underlying civil engineering infrastructure, that is, the ducts and poles, is not as susceptible to the same technological change.  That is why the cost of line rental, for instance, has not really gone down in price over the years, whereas the cost of a call or a megabit of broadband has reduced substantially.

The delegates stated the ownership issue was not a matter for ComReg.  However, I argue that it must be at the heart of its mission to regulate a market in which we do not have competition in circumstances where the State is effectively creating that monopoly.  In the case of the previous monopoly, when Eir was transferred to private ownership, the State was paid &euro;3 billion, of which the union received one third.  That was the deal - the private operator got the network and the State the money.  In the case of broadband, we are creating a monopoly where we give the money and the private operator gets the network.  The ownership question is fundamental in all of this.  Is ComReg not concerned, in its role as regulator, about the nature of the monopoly we are creating?  As Deputy Stanley said, it is a strange monopoly in that it involves both the monopoly of the pole owner and the monopoly of the fibreglass owner.  Surely ComReg has an interest in the wisdom of creating a private monopoly which will be in place for 40, 50, 60 or 70 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#Y00900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1559689200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>As regulator, we care a lot about monopolies or, to use the technical term we use, where there is \"significant market power\".  It matters much less to us whether it is a private or publicly owned monopoly; we regulate in exactly the same way in either case.  Our role is to make sure that if there is an entity with significant market power, it is not allowed to abuse that market power.  We are concerned to ensure it cannot use its power to prevent competition in downstream markets and expand the scope of its monopoly beyond where it naturally arises.<\/p><p>In rural areas, it is not a commercial proposition even for one network to be deployed.  The Government subsidy scheme is there to ensure that there is one network.  Inevitably if there is one, it is an monopoly.  The state aid guidelines recognise when there is a market failure and a Government intervention that will create a monopoly.  That is a phenomenon not only in Ireland but in all the other markets across Europe where there have been public interventions to provide broadband.  The state aid guidelines effectively require the state, the Irish State in our case, to put in place provisions in the contract that look very similar to the sorts of remedies a regulator would apply if it found significant market power in the commercial area.  That is why it must be a wholesale network that is provided.  It must be open to the participation of third parties, non-discriminatory in the way it treats the retail service provider and open to reasonable access requests and so on.  Some of the provisions in a contract, given the state aid rules, look quite similar to a ComReg decision that imposes obligations on an operator with a significant market power.  As a regulator, we are used - as the Deputy stated, this is core to our job - to looking for where there is significant market power and putting in place remedies to mitigate the impact of that significant market power.

I am the KPMG lead partner on the national broadband plan.  Joining me today are my colleagues, Mr. Robert Costello and Mr. Chris Rainbird, who are directors on my team.<\/p> <p>  In this opening statement I will provide some background on KPMG.  I will then take the committee through the scope of our engagement, followed by a summary of some of the key aspects of our advice.<\/p><p>I am a chartered accountant by profession and I have been a partner in KPMG since 2005.  I lead our government and infrastructure practice in Ireland.  For more than 20 years, I have provided financial and commercial advice to public and private sector bodies on major infrastructural projects in Ireland and overseas.  From a telecoms perspective, the team has advised on a range of projects in Ireland and internationally, including similar broadband projects in northern England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Australia.<br\/><br\/>We were appointed in December 2014, following a competitive tendering process, as financial and commercial advisers on the national broadband plan.  Our scope of advice was split into three phases.  During phase 1 KPMG advised on the ownership options, funding, governance and the financial appraisal of the project.  Phase 2 involved the state aid processes, which were led by PwC with Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran, which we supported.  Phase 3 was the procurement phase, during which KPMG provided advice on the design of the process, the commercial deal structure, the commercial contract terms and negotiations, the funding requirements and the overall process from pre-qualification to contract award together with a range of other <i>ad hoc<\/i>matters.  Analysys Mason is the technical adviser on the procurement and Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran is the legal adviser.<br\/><br\/>I will now describe in more detail some of the key areas of our advice, turning first to the ownership question.  Our 2015 ownership report examined five main options that were identified as potential vehicles for delivering the Government's national broadband plan intervention strategy.  The report provided a financial and non-financial appraisal of various ownership options.  Its preferred option was that the private sector design, build, operate and own the infrastructure.  We refer to this as the gap funding model.  This option was assessed as the least expensive in monetary terms and ranked highest on deliverability of the non-financial objectives.<br\/><br\/>There were a variety of reasons for this recommendation.  Some of the over-riding ones were that where the private sector owns the infrastructure, it is incentivised from a commercial perspective to continue to invest in and upgrade the infrastructure and to continue to drive additional usage from the infrastructure indefinitely.  This, in turn, drives additional economic benefit to Ireland.  This could be achieved under other options but it would be through a contractual obligation, which we believe is not as strong as a commercial imperative.  Under the recommended option, the State transfers significant downside risk to the private sector, such as technological obsolescence and long-term renewal of the asset, while retaining upside through a variety of financial sharing mechanisms over the life of the contract.<br\/><br\/>I shall turn next to some key aspects of our role during the procurement.  As the committee is aware, shortly before detailed solutions were to be submitted SIRO withdrew from the procurement.  The Department received detailed solutions from the two remaining bidders, namely, Granahan McCourt and Eir, in September 2017.  In their detailed solution submissions, both of the bidders that remained in the procurement projected significantly higher levels of subsidy than the Department's budget model.  The Department, therefore, made the decision to reappraise the project in accordance with the public spending code and asked KPMG to assist.  The reappraisal identified a long list of eight options.  The results of our assessment indicated that the current approach should continue.  This assessment was made based on looking at the then current situation against the same criteria as the original ownership report.<br\/><br\/>Following Eir's withdrawal from the process, the Department requested that KPMG undertake a review of the available procurement options at that point.  The review concluded that the current process should continue but came with a clear recommendation on including initiatives to address the lack of competitive tension.  The report also considered the methodology regarding how we would assess whether a bid received in a single bidder situation was acceptable to meet the requirements under the public spending code.<br\/><br\/>The final tender was received in September 2018.  The overall finding of the tender evaluation completed by KPMG and Analysys Mason was that the final tender was now capable of satisfying the Department's requirements as set out in the tender documentation.  A tender evaluation considers how well the bid meets the requirements of the Government.  This is different from the cost-benefit analysis as prepared by PwC, which compared costs to economic benefits delivered.<\/p><p> I turn to the concept of value for money.  In light of the fact that two bidders had withdrawn from the procurement process before the final tender stage, it has not been possible to compare the final tender received with any competing bid, which is the traditional means of assessing value for money.  Using the methodology that we had set out previously, additional detailed analysis was undertaken by KPMG, with support from Analysys Mason, to inform the Department's consideration of whether the final tender submitted by the remaining bidder was an acceptable outcome for the Government by reference to the public spending code.  This analysis examined various means by which to verify or benchmark key components and assumptions in the tender, and it concluded that the bidder's final tender pricing was higher than expected in some key areas.  The detailed technical assessment undertaken by Analysys Mason concluded that the bidder proposed a technical solution that was capable of delivering on the Government's requirements.<\/p><p> Each of the areas of difference between the bidder's key assumptions and the Department's was then considered to ensure that the Department was adequately protected should its assumptions prove to be more accurate than the bidder's.  In a number of areas, we made additional recommendations to try to enhance the relevant contractual provisions in favour of the Department further.  However, a contract is only effective if it is appropriately adhered to and implemented by both parties.  We have made a series of recommendations throughout this report as to the level of effort and skills required to monitor and oversee the various contractual provisions.<\/p><p> This has been a protracted procurement process to this point, but that is reflective of the complexity of the infrastructural deficit that the project is trying to address.  It is a large and complex project with significant inherent risks.  It has also had to address varying challenges along the way.  The level of detailed work that was undertaken at key stages to assess and reassess the optimal route forward as circumstances changed has been significant.  The solution on the table now, which is more expensive than originally envisaged, has been assessed as capable of delivering on the Government's requirements.  It is underpinned by a contract that, if implemented and monitored appropriately, should provide the Government with the mechanisms to exercise oversight over the deployment and long-term operation of the network, share in certain upsides, and limit the downsides of the project.  I am happy to take questions on the advice that we have provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#UU00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Connolly.

No one-size-fits-all approach has been adopted across a range of other jurisdictions.  Each jurisdiction has come at it slightly differently.  Many other jurisdictions have encountered similar issues in the transfer of risk, particularly in terms of the degree to which one can use existing infrastructure within the jurisdiction.  In terms of two key projects that we examined, one followed a similar approach and the other followed a different one.  The one that followed a different approach was Australia.  It started out in 2008 seeking to deliver a similar level of coverage, that is, 100% coverage, and a similar standard of broadband.  It initially sought to deliver that using a concession model involving the private sector designing, building and operating the network, but the public sector owning it.  One of the challenges that Australia encountered early on was access to the existing infrastructure which was owned by the incumbent private sector operator.<\/p><p>That did not prove possible to deliver within the confines of the procurement process and it pressed stop on its concession procurement.  It reappraised its options and went a different route, which was to set up a publicly owned State-owned company, with the view the State-owned company would design, build, own and operate the network.  That has been under way since the entity was established in 2008 and 2009.  The entity has not proceeded according to plan.  The roll-out is over budget.  It is quite significantly behind schedule.  It also has encountered the difficulty that with changing administrations, there have been changes in policy positions that have resulted in changing technology being used across the project.  As a range of different technologies is being used, it is not fibre to the premises, which is used in Ireland.  That is one option of which we were well aware.<\/p><p> A second option is what is used across the water in the UK.  In the UK, a State company, BDUK, was established to manage the delivery of its objectives.  Its objective is comparable to ours because it is set by the European Commission objective, which is to deliver nationwide coverage of 30 Mbps and above.  It went through three phases.  The first phase was to try to deliver 90% coverage with a second wave to identify 95% coverage and a third wave to deliver the balance.  The approach was to let a series of framework contracts from which local authorities and regions throughout the UK could draw to then deliver broadband.  As its approach is gap-funded the same as ours, the private sector will design, build, own and operate those networks.<\/p><p> Let me outline a couple of key points to note in terms of progress to date.  Its initial first wave of framework agreements to deliver the 90% phase had only one bidder.  That bidder was the incumbent, BT.  Later waves had a broader range of bidders.  The initial contracts have been under way for a number of years at this stage and we can already see the contractual mechanisms, which were adopted and which in particular included a range of the clawback provisions similar to what we have in the current contract here, and under those clawback provisions, more than &pound;700 million is already due to come back to BDUK from differing levels of take-up on the ground compared with what was expected.<\/p><p> When we set out to look at the ownership options and reappraise them, on each occasion we looked around to see what had happened elsewhere, what had worked well, what had perhaps not worked so well, making sure to look, in particular, to adopt comparable mechanisms to what had worked well such as the clawback mechanisms, and to build on and enhance them.  Just as importantly, we looked to see where there were areas of difficulty with a view to know how to avoid it in the projects we have here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#BBB00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele Connolly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#CCC00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>My first question is on the options paper, which formed the basis of the Government's decision afterwards, which was the gap model.  The paper stated the gap-funding model had a number of advantages and outlined them: it was the cheapest option to the State overall, minimising exposure to risk.  It recognised that it would take the advantage of competition between bidders to further lower the contribution from the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  Of course, that was then and this is now.  The situation has changed.  We have only one bidder as the other two pulled out fairly quickly after Eir secured the 300,000 easiest-to-reach households.  We have no competition for the contract.  The cost to the State has gone from &euro;800 million to almost &euro;3 billion.<\/p><p>If one examines the way this is set out over its first years, one will see that the State is front-loading the contract with &euro;2.95 billion worth of risk.  The private bidders are putting in less than &euro;200 million.  I ask Ms Connolly to explain this.  Certain advantages were heavily leaned on and highlighted as reasons to go with the gap model in the first instance.  Now we are in a different place.  We have been in it for well over a year.  Which of the advantages that were set out in the initial appraisal still exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#CCC00300","speaker":"1232","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1559689200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>As I have mentioned, when we looked at the original ownership report, we assessed the gap-funded option against a series of objectives that existed at the time.  If we go through the objectives to see which of them still apply, one of the first ones we will see is coverage.  It is projected that the option which is on the table now will deliver 100% coverage at speeds of 30 Mbps or above.  The second criterion - market effectiveness - assesses whether the option on the table delivers the minimum intervention necessary in the marketplace that leaves it open and transparent and non-discriminatory to any of the retail service providers.  The option that is on the table, with the tender we have, delivers that.  It offers openness, transparency and certainty of pricing to the retail service providers that might come forward.  It intervenes only to the extent that the private sector will not provide services on a commercial basis.  The third criterion - assessing whether there was an incentive to invest - involves looking at whether the option ensures that whoever owns the network is incentivised to continue to invest in, repair and maintain the network and to future-proof the network over its lifetime.  The bid that is on the table now includes such an incentive within it.  The private sector is taking the risk of continuing to invest in the network and to future-proof it over its lifetime.  The final criterion I will mention involves protecting the public interest.  Various mechanisms within the option that is now on the table seek to ensure the State is protected from bearing further downside risk while being able to share in the upside to this project through the deployment, internal rate of return and terminal value clawback mechanisms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22019060500002#DDD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Michele Connolly"},{"type":"speech","time":1559689200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Like others, I contend that some of the objectives could have been achieved by using a different model.  Some of what Ms Connolly has stated is incorrect.  I have been monitoring the overall project.  I have been discussing it with various people in this room and elsewhere for three years.  This is the most unusual contract I have ever seen.  It is a most unusual process.  There were five interested parties at the start.  Three of them got involved in the bidding process.  This entity spawned from Enet.  I was told by representatives of Enet that the company's preferred option was for the main infrastructure to be in public ownership.  That is what was stated at the time.  There were changes among the personnel in that entity, including the people in charge.  SSE, Enet and Laing were involved when the bidding part of the game and the tender process got under way.  There have been others along the way.  All of them have big economic firepower and a history of being involved in major infrastructural projects in England, Scotland, Wales and other parts of the world.  They have pulled out.  I do not know whether Ms Connolly agrees with what I have to say about the cost.  If it emerged at a county council meeting that the cost of a project had multiplied almost fourfold, it would not get off the blocks.  The extent to which taxpayers will be leaned on to pay for this project has increased from &euro;800 million to &euro;2.95 billion.<\/p><p>That is extraordinary.  The changes in entity that took place since the earlier changes and since Eir and the ESB pulled out changed the whole game.  Once Eir and the ESB pulled out, the tendering process was banjaxed.  I have listened to the delegates explain their view and it is good that they are here because I am interested to hear their explanations, they having designed the tendering process.  Government spokespersons have defended the process, but no matter what way one turns it, reliance was placed on the examination and a lot of faith put in ComReg, representatives of which appeared before the committee this morning and which does not have enough resources to do what it is now doing, even before this show gets on the road.  We know that from documents it released on foot of freedom of information requests.  Even at this late stage, Enet has changed again, with Frank McCourt turning out to be the main investor.<\/p><p> Another unusual aspect to the process is that the original cost seems to have been based on it being likely that SIRO, comprising the ESB and Vodafone, or Eir, which had just been bought by a French investor and is in its ownership, would be the chosen bidder.  Now that neither of those bidders was chosen, the taxpayer will fund a subsidy of between &euro;900 million and &euro;1 billion - nobody has disputed this - which is to be paid to hang cables on their poles.<\/p><p> Those are just some of the highlights that stick out as being extraordinary, to say the least.  There are other extraordinary things about the process.  By any standard, it does not have an ounce of credibility in the eyes of a large section of the public and many in the industry.  It was the wrong process from day one to go with the gap-funding model, but that is a separate issue.  Even assuming that we put our faith in the gap-funding model, it is extraordinary in terms of the standards by which it ought to operate and with what we have been left.  I do not see any advantage to it.  I listened very carefully to what Ms Connolly had to say and I respect that she is here to do a job, but I do not see the advantages as outlined in her initial appraisal.<\/p><p> On page 8 of the 2018 reappraisal it is stated that the purpose of the report is to provide a reappraisal of the NBP in line with the public spending code.

That is the calculation and the Government would then be entitled to get 40% of that terminal value of whatever that is the valuation.  What those numbers are will be dependent on what the actual performance of the business is at that point, both in terms of the level of demand, as the Deputy mentioned, and the function of the not insignificant cost involved to operate this network, including the cost of using the existing infrastructure owned by Eir.
