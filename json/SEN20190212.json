It is always great when a senior Minister comes in to deal with this type of very serious issue.  I do not want to give its name, but a small school in west Clare has a student who is visually impaired.  A vital piece of equipment has been purchased between the school and the parents of the child, in order for him to access vital statistics from the whiteboard and to be able to operate on a level playing pitch with the other boys and girls in the school.

I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on the status of broadband services in schools.  The delivery of high quality Internet connectivity for all schools is a key objective of my Department.  It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools can progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and facilitate the implementation of new and revised curriculums.  An interdepartmental group involving my Department and officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is working to determine how best to address high-speed broadband connectivity to all primary schools.  This group will take account of developments in the Government's national broadband plan and its associated intervention strategy, which targets areas for the State intervention element of the national broadband plan.<\/p> <p>Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local available infrastructure, which can impact on the level of service that can be provided.  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the school location.  In terms of the broadband services in the school referred to by the Senator, it should be noted that the school is located in the national broadband plan intervention area and services in this area are targeted under the national broadband plan.  This school currently has a service which provides broadband speeds of up to 3 Mbps on a DSL line.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In an effort to improve services to the school, it was recently the subject of a broadband mini-competition organised by the Department.

Equipment under the scheme is provided for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment.  Funding was provided under this scheme to the school in the case referred to by the Senator.  It should be noted that the equipment provided does not require an ongoing broadband connection to facilitate access to the curriculum.  If the school has concerns or needs advice, it may consult the visiting teacher service of the NCSE, which will be able to assist.<\/p><p>Under the current schools broadband programme, the Department's practice is to review constantly the availability of broadband with the aim of improving services to all primary schools as broadband connectivity improves throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#B00400","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

A similar scheme has been announced by SIRO in the larger towns.  Ennis in County Clare might have been covered by that.  There are other options through Eir and through copper connectivity.  The focus in the short to medium term - not the medium to long term - has to be on the national broadband plan.  The schools that are not getting broadband at the moment will be covered by that.  It is important.  I appreciate the Senator's decision to raise this matter.  It is about equality of access.  People cannot be discriminated against just because of geography.

The people in Rush are very anxious about their personal security and the security within the town.  We were very happy when this reopening was announced.  I would like an update on what stage it is at.  The last time I raised this issue was in May 2018 and at that point there was a discussion between the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to an assessment of needs.

The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on my Department's website, recommends that Rush Garda station be reopened along with the following stations: Ballinspittle, County Cork; Bawnboy, County Cavan; Leighlinbridge, County Carlow; Donard, County Wicklow; and Stepaside, County Dublin.<\/p> <p>It is important to recognise that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works.

The Minister has been informed, however, that at the outset of the pilot reopening process the Garda authorities provided a brief of requirements to the OPW on the reopening of each of these six Garda stations and requested that the OPW carry out technical surveys to determine the works necessary to enable the stations to reopen.<\/p> <p>The Senator is aware that following the consideration of the OPW technical surveys of each of the six stations, the Commissioner identified the organisation's preferred way forward bearing in mind operational needs, costs, timeframe for delivery and other factors.

We are informed that the OPW is currently preparing tender documents to procure the required works at Rush station via the OPW measured term maintenance contract.  Some interim minor maintenance works such as clearing pathways and so on will be carried out by the OPW regional office in advance of those works.  The OPW has said it expects works to be complete and the Rush station to be handed over to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by this year, summer 2019.

I was contacted recently by an Irish woman whose British wife recently gave birth to their son, who was conceived through assisted human reproduction methods.  They are both legally recognised as parents in Britain on all statutory documents, including the birth certificate.  However, when the Irish mother, who is the non-biological mother, wished to apply for an Irish passport for her child, she was told that she was not recognised as a mother under law and, therefore, was not entitled to apply for an Irish passport for her child.<\/p> <p>The reply from the Department to a recent parliamentary question that I submitted through Deputy Crowe confirmed the position and stated that, for the purposes of Irish law and with specific reference to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, a parent is understood to mean either the mother or father of the child.  It further stated that for the purposes of Irish law the mother of a child is the person who gives birth to the child or a female adopter of the child.  What this means in reality is that same-sex parents are excluded.  These parents frequently rely on assisted human reproduction methods to conceive.  Parents who are legally recognised and hold Irish citizenship cannot extend their citizenship rights in the same manner as everyone else.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is clear discrimination and a very real denial of rights and would certainly not withstand legal challenge.<\/p><p>It bears some resemblance to the time when we did not have marriage equality, before we held the referendum on civil marriage equality, and the relationship of couples who had been married elsewhere was relegated to a civil partnership in this State.

The referendum that followed brought with it very hurtful conversations on the validity of same-sex parent-led families, when posters stating \"Every child deserves a mother and a father\" were put up around the State.  The people's vote said that there is no single proposition for a family in Ireland, only diversity.<\/p><p>We urgently need relevant legislation to catch up and it is unacceptable that a passport form in this day and age would ask for a mother and a father and exclude same-sex parents.

While much of my response is quite technical in outlining the situation as it stands, the Senator has brought it back to what it should be about, namely, families, children and their parents.  While he, I and many others would recognise both people in the example he gave as parents, the letter of the law says otherwise.  We have to work to bring about change, as we have done in the past and as the Senator outlined.<\/p> <p>All passports are issued in accordance with the provisions of the Passports Act 2008, as amended.  Pursuant to section 7 of the Act, a passport cannot be issued unless the Minister is satisfied that the person is an Irish citizen and as to the identity of the person.  Citizenship is governed by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, which is under the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Legislative measures relating to citizenship do not fall within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I will therefore confine my remarks to an explanation of the current citizenship legislation under which the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates.  I will also explain the current legislative situation relating to guardianship of children.<\/p> <p>The Department, specifically the passport service, is tasked with processing passport applications in line with the requirements of the Passports Act.  The passport service has received several applications from same-sex married couples seeking to obtain Irish passports for their children born abroad and, in giving due consideration to these applications, has rightly raised a number of issues relating to both citizenship and guardianship with the relevant Departments and the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>I would like to set out the current legislation on citizenship.  Section 7 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, addresses citizenship by descent and provides that a person is an Irish citizen from birth if at the time of his or her birth either parent was an Irish citizen, although an additional requirement of registration is imposed in respect of children born outside the island of Ireland where the Irish citizen parent was also born outside the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>For the purposes of the 1956 Act, a parent is understood to mean either the \"mother\" or \"father\" of the child.  For the purpose of Irish law, the mother of a child is the person who gives birth to the child or a female adopter of a child.  In general, the \"father\" is the person identified as the genetic father of the child or a male adopter.<\/p> <p>The passport service has received passport applications for children born outside the State to same-sex couples where one member of the couple is an Irish citizen and the other is not.  Following consideration of the 1956 Act, the passport service understands that, under the current legislation, where the Irish citizen is neither the birth mother nor the genetic father or neither the male nor female adopter of the child, the child does not qualify for Irish citizenship by descent.  The passport service sought and received advice on its understanding of the 1956 Act from the Office of the Attorney General.<\/p> <p>While the passport service's understanding was confirmed, the Office of the Attorney General was of the view that further confirmation from the Department of Justice and Equality was required.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The passport service has sought clarification  from the Department of Justice and Equality on this and many other related matters, including the effect on citizenship of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, once commenced by the Minister for Health.  <\/p><p>I would like to outline the current legal status and position on guardianship.  There are particular provisions in the Passport Act dealing with applications for children.  Under the terms of the Act, the passport service requires the consent of a guardian or guardians before issuing a passport for a child under the age of 18 years, subject to very limited exceptions.  Section 14(1) of the Act provides, \"The Minister shall, before issuing a passport to a child, be satisfied on reasonable grounds that where a child has two guardians, each guardian of the child, and where a child has two or more guardians, at least two of those, consent to the issuing of a passport for the child\".  In line with section 2 of the Act, \"guardianship\" is a term with a defined legal meaning.  For the purposes of that section, \"a guardian\" means a person who, first, is a guardian of the child pursuant to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 and, second, is appointed to be a guardian by either the child, deed, or will or order of court in the State and has not been removed from that office.  In cases where a child has only one guardian within the meaning of the legislation, the guardian is required to complete a sole guardian affidavit to confirm that there is no other person to confirm that no other person holds guardianship rights in respect of the child applying for a passport.  This is necessary in order to verify that the requirements for guardian consent have been satisfied.  It is my understanding the Minister for Health has recently met civil society representative groups from the LGBTI community to discuss a range of issues, including the rights of same-sex couples and their children.  I will bring this debate to the attention of the Minister, the Minister for Justice and Equality and my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney.  This is an issue we need to address and it is an area in which I would like to see further progression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#F00200","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I hope the Minister of State will appreciate that she has provided a lot of information and that I will not be able to extract the key points in just one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#G00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I might give the Senator some latitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#G00300","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>People have a reasonable expectation, after the big national conversation we had on foot of the referendum, that relevant obstacles will be dealt with.

Last week there was an announcement that the 40 housing units to be provided in the South Lotts Road area, which is in a strategic development zone, SDZ, were to be provided instead in Rialto.  The units were to be part of the community gain from the SDZ covered under Part V of the legislation.  Following on from the media coverage of the issue, it was announced by senior officials at Dublin City Council that there would be no social housing in Dublin 2, Dublin 4 or Dublin 6 without a special case being made for it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Another senior official said there would be no affordable housing in Dublin 2, Dublin 4 or Dublin 6.  The best they can expect is to build them out in the suburbs.  This has led to fears, which I can understand, that the 350 social units promised for the strategic development zone in Poolbeg West will not be delivered, never mind the 550 affordable and affordable rental homes promised by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney.<br\/><br\/>The deposits have been paid on the sites in the strategic development zone, SDZ, in Poolbeg West and on the Poolbeg Peninsula.  Some &euro;30 million has been set aside for a bridge over the River Dodder to give access to the Poolbeg West development site.  The taxpayers paid for the decontamination of the site and there is a blank cheque from the Department for the plinth that has to be put in place but which is, so far, uncosted.<br\/><br\/>It is unacceptable for senior city council officials to say there will be no social or affordable housing in these areas and to be left unchallenged by the Department.  The previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, gave a firm commitment to the delivery of 900 units and this is written into the strategic development zone plan that is before An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the moment.  Fine Gael has been saying that the housing crisis can only be solved by delivery but we know there is a strong lobby for going higher.  I do not necessarily have a problem with height or density but there are three strategic development zones in the Docklands - the North Lotts, the South Lotts and Poolbeg West.  There is speculation that building on the North Lotts will go higher.  The Minister needs to take note of the fact that strategic development zones have clear objectives and integrated planning schemes.  If one goes higher in one location one has to do the same for all developments in that location and if one increases commercial development, one also has to increase residential, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  With the height strategy outlined by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Government is running the risk of undermining the three strategic development zones.  The outcome will be that over 5,000 units in this city will be delayed.<br\/><br\/>I am not sure if the Government has the competence to manage this issue.  All I see in the attempts to increase the supply of housing is mistake after mistake.  There have been three delays in supply, all caused by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These were the change in apartment sizes, the change in car parking spaces and the change relating to the height strategy.  All led to further planning applications, even though developments of over 100 units can go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There has been delay after delay with applications being withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#G00600","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with the question that was asked, as well as the ten other questions that were added in during the Senator's contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#H00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>They are related issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#H00300","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>My role regarding Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is to provide the policy and legislative framework, while the day-to-day administration and operation of Part V are a matter for the local authorities.  Senator Humphreys will, no doubt, be aware that following an independent review of Part V, completed in 2014, which included a detailed and lengthy consultation process and which took into account the general housing market trends at that time, the requirement was reduced from 20% to 10%, effective from 1 September 2015.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->My Department subsequently issued statutory guidelines to local authorities on the amended Part V rules.  These guidelines recommended that the acquisition of units on the development site be the preferred option for local authorities.  However, each local authority must make sure its Part V agreements constitute the best use of financial resources available and that unit sizes meet social housing requirements.<\/p><p>My Department considers all requests from local authorities for sanction for funding of the acquisition of units under Part V in light of construction costs in the area, and also one of the key aims of Part V, the general social integration, which is a very important one. <\/p><p>Senators will know that Part V is just one constituent part of the significant efforts being made by this Government to deliver the social housing supports that Ireland needs in the coming years.  These efforts are backed up by an unprecedented level of investment under the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  More than &euro;6 billion of taxpayers' money will be spent during the lifetime of that plan delivering in excess of 50,000 social housing homes, as well as many more supports through the private rental market.  Part V homes are expected to deliver just under 5,000 of the overall total and as the construction sector recovers and delivery increases, so too does our dividend in terms of Part V.  It is encouraging to see their numbers increase year on year because they not only deliver additional stock but make a vital contribution, as I mentioned, in terms of promoting social integration and developing more positive sustainable communities - a benefit to all of Irish society.  I know Senator Humphreys agrees with that.  That is probably part of what the debate on this Commencement matter is about, namely, to ensure that we still achieve that.  <\/p><p>We are very much about delivering the social housing we need as a nation.  We are also very well aware of the need to build those sustainable mixed tenure communities all over Ireland.  In general, this approach works well across the country.  Unfortunately there are occasions when our two key objectives of increased delivery and social integration can come into some conflict.  When this happens we must be pragmatic, constructive and seek to strike the right balance.  Such a scenario tends to happen in what might be termed more \"high-end\" developments.<\/p><p>As to areas such as the Dublin Docklands, all options for the delivery of Part V homes are explored, including the most cost-effective way of delivering much-needed social housing units in these specific electoral areas.  Alternatives can, if required, be explored, particularly off-site development nearby which delivers more homes for the same price.  In other words, there is the option in some scenarios for some land swaps or for some land to be given in terms of housing.  My Department is committed to working with the council to help find that balance and to deliver solutions that increase our social housing stock in the places where they are needed but at a price that is acceptable to the Exchequer.  That is a decision that has to be made locally as we tease through the different sites.<\/p><p>On the Deputy's attempt to suggest that changes we have made with respect to apartments sizes, car parking spaces, and height strategy are delaying matters, we have to make necessary changes to effect the overall supply of housing now and well into the future.  We have the Rebuilding Ireland document, which is a strategy for social housing and housing in general.  We are reaching all the targets set in terms of what we want to deliver, both in the private sector and the public sector.  We are bang on target right across the board.  The Central Statistics Office figures confirmed that last week.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the changes we have made might in some cases on different sites generate new applications, but it has been confirmed that the overall supply of housing is up by 25%.  Commencement notices are up by more than 50%.  With respect to some sites, there will be chop and change but the overall delivery is up and the trend is positive.<\/p><p>We believe the changes we have made regarding the height strategy, car parking spaces and so on will increase the supply and mix of housing coming onstream which we badly need.  Those are changes that were probably put off for many years by previous Governments but we have made them now and I have no doubt they will effect supply in a positive way in the future.  One can select one or two sites and argue over them but we have had to make decisions in the round to increase the supply of housing well into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#H00400","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Minister of State clearly knows what I have said to him.

I raise this issue because the House voted to express concern about the prospect of an investor court system that would allow corporations to sue states for lost future profits when new regulations are introduced by elected representatives in response to the needs of the electorate.  There would be what has been termed a significant chilling effect on our ability to pursue good policy, respond politically and regulate.  With these courts comes the risk that any new regulatory decision could be a hostage to fortune because a blank cheque had effectively been given to any corporation looking for lost future profits, which is a wide scope.  The House debated the matter at length.  It is unfortunate that problematic elements in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, are raising their head again in the EU-Singapore investment treaty.  I have urged our MEPs to vote \"No\" because we can have a better kind of trade deal.  We all want trade, but it has to work for citizens as well as corporations.<\/p> <p>The House will hold further debates on the issue, as we cannot afford to introduce such courts, particularly in light of our climate change commitments.  The idea that strengthening those commitments would come with a \"hostage to fortune\" cost is in conflict with our international obligations.  Of particular concern is that the EU-Singapore treaty also asserts the right to overturn local government decisions.  I say this on a day when Dublin City Council produced a climate change action plan for Dublin, for which I applaud it, that is more ambitious than the Government's action plan for the State.  Dynamic actions are being taken on issues like climate change at local level, but these new treaties would not only lead to challenges to the State, but also to local authorities, and would have a chilling effect on them and stop them taking proactive actions.<\/p> <p>I wish to make a specific request.  I thank the Leader for arranging improved debates on climate change in recent weeks, with witnesses appearing before us.  However, there is a linked, but different, crisis.  Will the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment address the House on the ecological crisis?  Certain areas are seeing a 60% extinction level and there are reports of a 40% decline in the number of insects, something that has been called a catastrophic collapse.  At the beginning of our term in the Seanad, we debated the pollinator plan, our hedgerows, and the importance of insect life and green corridors.  These issues are linked to, but distinct from, climate change.  Will the Leader arrange a specific debate on this matter and will he pass my request on to the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#P00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the determination and dignity of the nurses.

A previous Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform challenged all spending, as Senator Reilly, a former Minister for Health, will attest.  It was a challenging environment in the previous five-year Government term when it came to expenditure matters, and each item of spending was put under a magnifying glass to ensure we could get full value for money for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>There has been a change in the structure of the Department of Finance and it has caused cost overruns, including with the children's hospital.  When we speak of accountability, we must understand the reasons.  We cannot lay this at the door of one person as there is collective Cabinet responsibility.  This must be taken seriously as too often, under every Government, there have been overruns.  We must examine the people getting the contracts and how they legally challenge those contracts if they do not win them.  We must consider how they enlarge their cost base when they get those contracts.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kevin Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to raise a very serious issue which was on the front page of<i>The Irish Times<\/i>today.  The article said that families who turn down offers of social housing are to face a five-year wait.  To be honest, I believe this is spin.  This is about blaming people who are on the housing list for the housing crisis.  I know of very few people on the housing waiting list who have refused housing units.  I deal with a huge number of applicants week in and week out and the vast majority are delighted when they get an offer.<br\/><br\/>There have been some refusals.  I accept that.  Sometimes there have been very good reasons and sometimes there have been poor reasons, but we should not blame people who are on the housing list.  The issue should not be spun on the front page of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>and it should not be suggested that all those poor people on the waiting list are refusing housing, which is the subliminal message.  They are not.  I am only aware of one person who refused an offer of housing from Dublin City Council in the last six months and that was because the person would have had to give up their job because they would have had to surrender the support of their family in minding their children, which allowed them to go out to work.  The person would have then been caught in an unemployment-based poverty trap and housed well aware from their family.  I was disappointed.  The headline was spin rather than substance and blamed the people who are on the housing list.  It gave the message that they get loads of offers and keep saying &quot;No&quot;.  A tiny percentage refuse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#Q03000","speaker":"1417","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I want to raise a very important issue which affects the entire north of Dublin city and county, namely, metro north.  On Thursday Fingal County Council will present details of four master plans for Swords, involving 67 ha of land, 218,000 sq. m of commercial space, and 55 acres of office space in buildings four, five, six and seven storeys high.  Some 18,000 jobs will eventually be created in this area.  The plans include 2,700 badly needed homes.  There will be 10,000 new residents.  Another 3,500 homes are to be constructed as a result of the funding the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has made available under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  That represents another 12,000 residents, so there are to be 22,000 extra residents for Swords.  Swords has a population of 40,000 at the moment.  The Fingal development plan for 2017 to 2023 projects that the population will grow to 100,000.<\/p> <p>I would like the Leader to bring in the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport because we need the first phase of MetroLink to start as soon as possible.  I know there are issues and disputes about the route on the south side but there are no such disputes on the north side.  This has been in planning for more than 20 years.  It is very clear that MetroLink will take pressure off the city of Dublin by allowing access to the city from these lands by rapid transport.  It will connect the airport, DCU and Swords with the city.  As previous speakers have said, Fingal has the youngest population in Ireland and, possibly, in Europe.  These are talented, well educated people who are looking for jobs and who want to stay in Fingal.  The north end of the MetroLink line has to go ahead while the south side sorts itself out.  <\/p> <p>This initiative is close to my heart.  I fought for it during my time in Cabinet when there was no money and people wanted to kill it.  I wanted it to be kept alive.  We have the money now and we have a plan and preferred route for the north side.  Can we please proceed with this?  The Minister needs to come in here urgently to explain to us why it cannot go ahead on the north side now while the arrangements for the south side of the city are finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#R00200","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I would like to raise my concerns about the imposition of the 23% VAT rate on food supplements.

I call on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to revisit this decision before any further decisions are made on it.  This proposal will affect and hurt the most vulnerable in our society, namely, the people who are under severe financial pressure due to the rising costs of living.  People take food supplements for a variety of reasons, but they primarily take them to stay healthy, to stay away from their local GP and to stay away from hospitals that are already under pressure.  With Brexit just around the corner, the timing of this proposed increase is wrong.  I am disappointed to say that it is yet another example of the Government's total lack of understanding of what life is like for those of us who live in the Border counties, or what life is like for those who are trying to run a business in the Border counties.  It is difficult enough without making decisions like this.  If this decision goes ahead, it will result in people travelling across the Border to shop, which will have a very negative impact on the businesses that are struggling to stay open along the Border counties.  Consider the fact that this also follows on from the increased VAT rate for the hotel industry.  It does not fill me with confidence that the Government gets it when it comes to businesses and people and what they are going through in the Border counties.  I ask the Leader to bring our message back to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to press the stall button on this decision, for the benefit of people's health and for those who are trying to run and keep open businesses while employing people in Border counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#R00300","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as ucht deis labhairt anseo inniu mar gheall ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; gn&oacute;tha&iacute; beaga small and medium sized enterprises.

There is a major issue with insurance.  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, has conducted research recently on 850 SMEs that shows 83% of those SMEs are experiencing increases in insurance premiums.  We will debate the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 in this House later.  I very much welcome that legislation.  I received a phone call this morning on my way to the House from a person who has a business in the midlands.  Three years ago he employed 65 people and today he is employing about 115 people.  He has four cases of people looking to bring insurance claims against him.  A person can bring a claim against an employer and I have no problem with that.  I do have a problem, however, when on some occasions the claims are vexatious and may not be 100%.  I very much welcome the Bill.<\/p> <p>I am the rapporteur for the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which has drafted a comprehensive report that is very near completion and will be published shortly.  This report will give us an indication of the roadmap of the SMEs in Ireland.  Subject to the committee's approval and under the chairmanship of the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Coghlan, it is hoped we will have an opportunity to debate the issue and have a full session debate in this House with the relevant Ministers.

We have already seen tens of thousands of people in the UK and farther afield take the opportunity to seize Irish citizenship and apply for a passport.  The numbers of those applying to the Irish Embassy in Britain have multiplied every year-on-year.  We have serious questions to ask about the capacity of the passport service to meet these demands.  The passport service, much to the credit of the Ministers and officials working there, has vastly and greatly improved in recent years with the rapid online system and improvements in many others processing areas.  However, I have fears in respect of the capacity and I believe it is our absolute responsibility to meet the demand with a proper information campaign for the Irish diaspora.  This is something Senators Lawless and &Oacute; Donnghaile have worked hard on, whether in the US or the North, to ensure those who are Irish citizens know their entitlements, the processes and procedures and their rights.  We should ensure the process is met in the most speedy and proper manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#S00300","speaker":"1399","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Thank you for your brevity, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#T00200","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I salute my colleagues, the nurses and midwives of Ireland, following their great successful rally on Saturday and the extraordinary support of the public through the streets of Dublin.

Right now F&oacute;rsa estimates that 10% of the country's approximately 3,500 school secretaries are paid directly by the Department of Education and Skills, with their salaries varying from &euro;24,000 to &euro;44,711 per year.  The other 90% are paid through their schools' ancillary grant leaving some of the salaries as low as &euro;12,000 per year.  This grant is decided by the Department of Education and Skills and is sent to the school each year.  It then has to be paid out to the secretaries.  The majority of schools are forced to employ their school secretaries through their ancillary grant.<\/p> <p>This two-tier system means that in some schools there can be two secretaries doing exactly the same job in the same office, but one is paid &euro;44,000 per year and the other &euro;12,000 per year.  In any other walk of life this discrimination would be illegal.  Currently the majority of Ireland's school secretaries have to work for poor pay and without the most basic of employment rights such as sick pay or secure contracts, and they are mostly let go for the summer months and have to sign on for social welfare.  I know school secretaries who have been signing on for the summer or Easter breaks for years.  It is degrading to have to go to a social welfare office every July, and it is frustrating as the money they are entitled to can take up to six weeks to process.  <\/p> <p>Approximately 90% of all school secretaries have no pension rights.  These are people we all know in our communities.  This is a scandal.  I am crying out to all parties in the House to please support the school secretaries.  There is a F&oacute;rsa Support Our Secretaries campaign.  In addition, will the Leader please ask the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, to come to the House to discuss this issue?

It is a charity and it needs support.  Former members of the Defence Forces are going to highlight the plight of homeless veterans by camping on the streets of Dublin in sleeping bags made of fabric in the colours of the national flag.

I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the issue and will come back to the issues that individuals have raised.<br\/><br\/>Senator Humphreys should recognise that under regulation 12 of the Social Housing Allocation Regulations 2011, a household that refuses two reasonable offers of tenancy in any 12 month period other than an offer in the choice-based letting procedure will not receive any further offers from any housing authority for a period of one year from the second refusal.  That is already <i>in situ<\/i>.  We need to get some perspective on the issue of housing.  People refuse housing for a variety of issues.  Some are serial refusers.  Others have particular reasons and we accept that, but we must try to get a balance.<br\/><br\/>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of food supplements.  It is an interpretation of the tax code by Revenue which is independent of Government.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has a tax advisory group.  As I said in the House last week, some people are peddling a specific line but should also recognise that certain medicines, folic acids, vitamins and mineral products, as licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, are still zero and will remain at that.  We should have balance in what we say about the matter here.  I hope that we can have common sense with regard to some of the issues addressed by Senator Gallagher.<br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be the author of a very fine report regarding small and medium enterprises.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, coming from the Border, is well aware of the complexities and importance of small and medium enterprises.  I would be happy to have her to come to the House to address the matter.<br\/><br\/>Senators Richmond and Horkan raised the issue of passports and the need for debate on the passport system, which I would be happy to have.<br\/><br\/>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the F&oacute;rsa campaign to support school secretaries.  It is an important issue which requires clarity and parity.  We would all support it.<br\/><br\/>Senator McFadden raised the ONE campaign.  To be fair to the Senator, she has raised the matter on many occasions, both in and outside this House.  There is an issue relating to bed nights.  We need to compliment ONE which has provided 44 bed nights, which I think the Senator said has covered 900 veterans and includes approximately 16,000 bed nights per annum.  It is important that we support it and that we work to ensure that visibility and recognition is given to our veterans.  To be fair to the Senator, she has raised this in the past.<br\/><br\/>Senator Norris raised the issue of the inquiry into Shane O'Farrell's death.  We want the O'Farrell family to have full information, there has to be due process, and there has to be full accountability for those involved.  On completion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission inquiry, the Minister appointed Mr. Justice Haughton to carry out a scoping exercise.  From any point of view, that should be able to continue and to carry out its work rather than having a debate on that.  I am cognisant of the involvement of Senator Norris and do not want to be seen as offensive or unhelpful to the O'Farrell family and the need for full action.  I know the Minister is not available today and he is certainly not available tomorrow, because if he was, he would be having more debate on the very important Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, about which I will speak to Senator Craughwell.  I am prepared to offer Senator Norris a debate on the matter tomorrow afternoon without the Minister being present, if the Senator is amenable to that.  I do not want to be unhelpful and do not want to be seen to be obstructionist.  That is not my style.  A scoping inquiry has been put in place.  A process has been established.  I do not think that we should have debates in the House in parallel with that.  If Senator Norris is amenable to having a debate for an hour tomorrow without the Minister, I would be happy to do that, but otherwise I do not think that I can ask the Minister to come to the House at such short notice, knowing that he is not available today or tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#Y01900","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Will the Government oppose the motion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#Z00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":222,"content":"<p>On the basis of Senator Norris wanting the Minister to be here today, I will oppose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#Z00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":223,"content":"<p>The Government will oppose it tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00100","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>No.  I am offering Senator Norris an hour's debate tomorrow, without the Minister's presence, to allow the Senator the opportunity in the Seanad to have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00200","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I am asking the Leader whether the Government will oppose the motion tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I am making an offer to the Senator of an hour's debate tomorrow on the Senator's motion without the Minister's presence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00400","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00500","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I cannot answer the Senator's question right now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00600","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>The Leader does not know whether the Government will oppose the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00700","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>As of right now, I do not, but I will make-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019021200002#AA00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1549981800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I see.
