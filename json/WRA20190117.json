The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which has been accepted by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The increases due from 1 January 2018, 1 October 2018 and 1 January 2019 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled in 2019 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled as part of that agreement.<\/p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, can also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales for all such new entrants to the public service. This measure, should it be accepted by the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, will be effective from 1 March 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many factors and personal circumstances which can give rise to an individual needing support and advice in respect of particular financial difficulties. The Personnel Support Service provides a confidential information, education, support and referral service to Defence Forces personnel and their families, giving access to information and services within and outside the military community. <\/p>  <p>  Like other military organisations, turnover of personnel is higher than that which normally prevails in other sectors. In this context, there is ongoing recruitment and promotion to replace personnel who depart. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission is currently examining recruitment and retention issues in the Defence sector. This is on foot of an initial submission from the Department which highlighted certain recruitment and retention issues. The Commission's work is on-going.

Until recently, Irish troops served as part of a joint Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL.  The Finnish contingent also included an Estonian Platoon comprising some 36 personnel.  Due to other National commitments both Finland and Estonia withdrew from the Irish-Finnish Battalion in UNIFIL in November 2018.  As an interim measure, an additional contingent of approximately 106 Defence Forces Personnel have been deployed to the UNIFIL mission to cover the backfilling of the Finnish contingent for a 12 month period.

There are a number of factors, some of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.  As at 31 December 2018, the most current figures provided by the military authorities, the whole time equivalent strength of the Permanent Defence Force was just below 9,000 personnel, 8,957 to be exact. <\/p>  <p>  Recently, I met with senior civil and military officials to review recruitment plans for 2019. A range of options to enhance recruitment were considered. The target for inductions in 2019 is approximately 800 personnel. As outlined, the precise net gain in strength will be dependent on a variety of factors. This includes the number of trained personnel that depart, the achievement of recruitment targets and the number of trainees that successfully complete training. This can vary year on year.<\/p>  <p>  I have acknowledged that challenges do exist in recruiting and retaining some specialists such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers, and certain Technicians. These specialist can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic environment and jobs market, there are demands for such specialists in other sectors. I understand that this is a challenge being faced by military forces elsewhere and is not confined to Ireland.<\/p>  <p>   As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Service Pay Commission has been tasked with examining recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Sector. This work is underway and when the Public Commissions reports, its findings will be considered at that point.<\/p>  <p>   In addition to traditional recruitment methods, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing such vacancies in specialist areas. A scheme has been introduced which permits former Officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel. <\/p>  <p>  Currently there is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications which is utilised for the recruitment of Medical Officers and Engineers.  A working group is examining the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.    <\/p>  <p>   With regard to other retention measures, there are a range of actions outlined in the White Paper on Defence (2015) which are aimed at enhancing the capabilities of the Defence Forces. These include HR initiatives which impact on retention such as providing career development opportunities and accreditation.  The criteria for extending service beyond twelve years have been revised and this has ensured that personnel who would have had to depart could remain. An examination of age profiles for enlisted personnel has been prioritised and this is being progressed. In addition, the military authorities have introduced further initiatives to enhance work-life balance and this is also to be welcomed. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700057#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service Operations","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700057#WRA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[1958\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700057#WRA01700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has had discussions with senior officers in the Naval Service in regard to the fact that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has significant concerns in regard to the potential negative impact on Ireland's fishery protection through a decrease in the seagoing effort of the Naval Service; if so, the outcome of those discussions; and the next steps decided on to address those concerns.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":24,"content":"<p>My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going  agency tasked with a variety of defence and other roles.

It is also important to note that participation in each project is on an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; basis and is therefore entirely voluntary.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the role of the European Union in peacekeeping and crisis management operations and initiatives which enhance deployability and deployment on operations are essential to this. Under PESCO, Member States will come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  <\/p>  <p>  PESCO will also enable our Defence Forces to further develop their capabilities in support of peacekeeping through participation in joint projects with like-minded partners.  Joint projects should also drive down the costs of developing and procuring capabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Through participation in all aspects of CSDP, including PESCO, Ireland has been able to influence the overall direction of CSDP, in particular ensuring recognition by the EU of the UN as its key strategic partner and ongoing support for the UN and multilateralism.  Participation in PESCO will continue to be important in fostering that influence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700057#WRA02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":37,"content":"<p>Question No. 23 answered with Question No. 12.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Medicinal Products","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700058#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[1800\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700058#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the actions taken on foot of the two reports of the working group on Lariam.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>A Malaria Chemoprophylaxis Working Group was established in January 2011 and reported in April 2013.

Moreover, it will accelerate the provision for EU training missions due to a higher situational awareness regarding trained, educated and available personnel for current and future EU training missions. <\/p><p><b>Upgrade of Maritime Surveillance Systems<\/b>&ndash; This project will integrate land-based surveillance systems, maritime and air platforms in order to distribute real time information to Member States, so as to provide timely and effective response in the international waters.  The main objective of the program is to enhance the Maritime Surveillance, Situational Awareness and potential Response Effectiveness of the EU, by using the existing infrastructure, deploying assets and developing related capabilities in the future. It aims to address timely and effectively new and old threats and challenges (such as energy security, environmental challenges, security and defence aspects); thus ensuring accurate Awareness and Rapid Response, so as to contribute to the protection of the  EU and its citizens.<\/p><p>Ireland is an observer on the following projects:<\/p><p><b>Maritime (Semi) Autonomous Systems for Mine Countermeasures<\/b>will deliver a world-class mix of (semi-) autonomous underwater, surface and aerial technologies for maritime mine countermeasures.  This project will enable Member States to protect maritime vessels, harbours and off shore installations, and to safeguard freedom of navigation on maritime trading routes.  <\/p><p><b>Cyber Threats and Incident Response Information Sharing Platform<\/b>will develop more active responses and defences to cyber threats.  This project also aims to help mitigate these risks by focusing on the sharing of cyber threat intelligence through a networked Member State platform, with the aim of strengthening nations' cyber defence capabilities.<\/p><p><b>Energy Operational Function<\/b>based on lessons learnt from recent operations, this project has two objectives. It aims at developing new systems of energy supply for camps deployed in the framework of joint operations and for soldier connected devices and equipment.  It also aims at ensuring that the implications for energy are taken into account in capability development planning and implementation as well as operational planning.  <\/p><p><b>European Software Defined Radio <\/b>aims to develop common technologies for European military radios.  The adoption of these technologies as a standard will guarantee the interoperability of EU forces in the framework of joint operations, regardless which radio platforms are used, thereby reinforcing the European strategic autonomy.  <\/p><p><b>Deployable Military Disaster Relief Capability <\/b>will deliver a multi-national specialist military package for the assistance to EU and other States, which can be deployed within both EU-led and non EU-led operations.  The new EU capability will manage a range of emergencies including natural disasters, civil emergencies, and pandemics.  This project aims to include the establishment of a new EU Disaster Relief Training Centre of Excellence, and ultimately a Disaster Relief Deployable Headquarters.<\/p><p><b>Military Mobility <\/b>will support Member States' commitment to simplify and standardise cross-border military transport procedures.  It aims to enhance the speed of movement military forces across Europe.  It also aims to guarantee the unhindered movement of military personnel and assets within the borders of the EU.  This entails avoiding long bureaucratic procedures to move through or over EU Member States, be it via rail, road air or sea.<\/p><p><b>EU Radionavigation Solution (EURAS)<\/b>is to promote development of EU military PNT (positioning, navigation and timing) capabilities and future cooperation taking advantage of Galileo and the public regulated service.<\/p><p><b>Counter Unmanned Aerial System <\/b>aim is to develop an advanced and efficient system to counter the threat posed by Unmanned Aerial Systems.  It aims to deliver protection for personnel. <\/p><p>The above projects are still in the early stages of development and accordingly the budgets and timeline for participant's involvement has not yet been fully determined.

The Agreement also provides a forum for sharing information between parties and for dealing with fishery control and enforcement issues.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials, members of the Naval Service and the Air Corps, continue to meet with officials of the SFPA at formal and informal meetings and enjoy a good collaborative working relationship in relation to sea-fishery protection matters. My officials also meet regularly with officials from the Department of Agriculture and the Marine, which is the parent Department of the SFPA.  These close working relationships will continue in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the fleet, the White Paper on Defence 2015 underpins the on-going replacement of the Naval Service fleet which has enjoyed a significant investment in the new ships programme of over &euro;250 million since 2010. The Naval Service accepted delivery of the newest ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, in late 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is also investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). Delivery of these aircraft will start later this year and conclude in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence 2015 also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more suitable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft is underway in my Department at present, following the publication of a  Request for Proposals on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in May, 2018.   <\/p>  <p>  As I have previously outlined to the House, the UK decision to exit from the EU does not of itself give rise to greater responsibilities for the Defence Forces. Prudent planning in relation to all situations that may require a Defence Forces response, including fishery protection, is undertaken by the Defence Forces in the normal course. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700058#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":66,"content":"<p>Question No. 34 answered with Question No. 30.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Gender Balance","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700059#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[2094\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700059#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which gender balance remains an objective in the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>As of 31 December 2018, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force stood at 8,957 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) personnel.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.

Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas.<\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2018,  20 minibuses, 22 saloons, 61 logistics vehicles and 2 recovery vehicles were purchased for the Defence Forces,  and funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance).

While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they quickly developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.<\/p>  <p>  President Omar al-Bashir reacted by closing schools and declaring a state of emergency in some regions.  Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds.  It is reported that almost 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began. The Sudanese Government has said that 24 people have been killed during demonstrations, while Sudanese activists and medical workers say that the number killed is at least 40.  The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU's 24 December 2018 call on the Government of Sudan to exercise restraint, respect the right to peaceful protest and ensure that all law enforcement and security bodies act under its direct control and in accordance with Sudan's constitutional and international commitments.  Ireland also stands fully behind the EU statement of 11 January 2019 which calls on the Government of Sudan to release all journalists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained, and to guarantee the independence of the Investigation Committee tasked with the investigation of abuses.  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, driven by protracted conflicts, inequality and climate change.  These feed into the popular disaffection leading to protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children.

Violations of human rights and international humanitarian law serve to perpetuate the crisis, with a negative impact on its scale and with devastating consequences for the people of South Sudan. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and over 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.<\/p>  <p>  Drought has exacerbated the effects of conflict, leading to severe food insecurity.  There has been massive population displacement throughout the country.  Conflict, food insecurity and drought have affected women and girls particularly. <\/p>  <p>  On 12 September 2018, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with a number of the opposition forces. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders maintain their commitment to its effective implementation. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. Since the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s visit to Addis Ababa in 2017, when he met representatives of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union, Ireland has provided funding to IGAD to support negotiation of the peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November last year.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.<\/p>  <p>  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November 2018.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding was provided in 2018, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $178 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which provided more than &euro;90 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700059#WRC05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD00400"},{"type":"question","counter":123,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[2214\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent peace monitoring report published by an organisation (details supplied); his plans to discuss this report with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the parties represented in Stormont; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":124,"content":"<p>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers.<\/p>  <p>  The recent peace monitoring report from the Community Relations Council is extensive and covers topics ranging from the Northern Irish economy to LGBT rights.

Most recently, a cross-departmental delegation travelled to Paris for consultations on Brexit preparedness where the issue of the landbridge was comprehensively discussed, including the need for infrastructural solutions, such as designated lanes, at French ports to facilitate the free movement of Irish trucks transiting the UK. Officials also met with the European Commission for technical consultations on the landbridge in December 2018. In addition to meetings of Irish based officials, Embassy Paris has met with French authorities in relation to port infrastructure, including the Mayor of Calais, the Port of Calais, and the operators of Eurotunnel, and made representations regarding the segregation of Irish traffic arriving at the port of Calais and the Eurotunnel after transiting through the UK.<\/p>  <p>  These meetings have been productive and there is an openness at all levels in France to work with us to ensure the efficient transit of Irish trucks through French ports.

The Government will continue to work with our partners in France to seek suitable temporary solutions as part of our no deal planning, while, at the same time, working with them on permanent solutions, particularly in an orderly withdrawal scenario, so that the landbridge can continue to be an effective route for our operators trading with the rest of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[2237\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the talks that have taken place at EU level and commitments sought and secured in relation to state aid and EU financial support post-Brexit to assist Ireland; if no talks have taken place and no commitments sought, his plans in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>Making the case for supporting measures at EU level that recognise where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy is a key pillar of the Government&rsquo;s response to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  There is a firm understanding at EU level of the unique and disproportionate impact that Brexit will have on Ireland.

Some of these issues are discussed in general in the OECD report, including the design of financial incentives and drawdown products and the IDPRTG will consider this work in completing its report.<\/p>  <p>  ARFs were introduced in Finance Act 1999 to provide control, flexibility and choice to the holders of personal pension plans and proprietary director members of occupational pension schemes in the drawdown of their retirement benefits.  Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a defined contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible retirement lump sum. These options have since been extended to the benefits taken by any individual from DC pension arrangements generally.<\/p>  <p>  An internal review of tax relief for pension provision, undertaken by my Department and Revenue in 2005, found that the ARF option was largely not being used to fund an income stream in retirement as was intended, but rather was being us to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term.  To counteract this, Finance Act 2006 introduced, with effect from 2007, an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year.  This was phased in from 2007 to 2009: 1% in 2007; 2% in 2008; and 3% from 2009. The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.  Finance Acts 2011 and 2012 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5%, and 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.<\/p>  <p>  To reduce the risk that individuals in the age group 60 to 70 years might out-live their ARF funds, Finance Act 2014 reduced the 5% rate to 4% for ARF owners under the age of 70, where the value of assets in their ARF is &euro;2 million or less.  <\/p>  <p>  While most ARF owners take drawdowns at least equal to the notional distribution rate, there is no obligation on them to do so.  The requirement in the legislation is not a statutory minimum drawdown condition.  The only requirement is that tax is paid from the ARF on either the notional drawdown amount, whether it is drawn down or not, or on the amount actually drawn down if that is greater than the notional amount.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that on drawdown of retirement benefits, the decision regarding the purchase of an annuity or an ARF is a decision made by an individual based on that individual&rsquo;s specific requirements for retirement. Due to the current perceived poor value in annuities, ARFs are often a more popular post-retirement choice. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important that we protect the integrity of our Exempt, Exempt, Taxed (EET) approach to pension taxation by ensuring income is drawn down in retirement. Our system of pension tax relief ensures contributions and investment returns are exempted from tax and the pension drawdown amount is subject to tax. As stated previously, the IDPRTG, as part of its overall work is currently conducting a broad review of the utilisation of the ARF option, which in conjunction with its other work will inform future policy in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tracker Mortgages Data","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD04200"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[2226\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700060#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of complaints that have been taken to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to the tracker mortgage scandal; the value arising from these complaints; the number that have been decided on; the number that have been decided in favour of the complainant; the number that are still outstanding; the value of those complaints still outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Firstly, I must point out that the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman is independent in the performance of his statutory functions.  I have no role in the day to day workings of his office.<\/p>  <p>  However, I have been advised by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman that he currently has 1,221 complaints on hand in January 2019 which relate to tracker mortgage issues. Of those, 723 complaints were received in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has maintained that the most effective and efficient way to provide redress and compensation to borrowers who have been wrongly denied tracker mortgages was for the banks to co-operate fully with the Central Bank Examination. Therefore, whilst the Examination was still underway individual tracker mortgage-related complaints were placed on hold pending confirmation that the Central Bank Examination had concluded in respect of those complainants. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2018, a decision was taken to begin to take complaints that could potentially progress, off hold. The duration required to investigate a complaint can vary depending on the number of submissions made by the parties to the complaint as each one will trigger a transparent and sometimes extensive exchange of evidence and submissions. Each complaint is considered on its own merits.  No legally binding decisions on trackers were issued by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The, now dissolved, Financial Services Ombudsman dealt with tracker complaints since 2009.

Neither may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:<\/p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.<\/p>  <p>  There have to date been 28 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further 5 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006, any proposed community CCTV scheme must have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.  I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November 2018  the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office issued a note (available on its website www.dataprotection.ie) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Data Protection Commission confirmed that:  &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The Data Protection Commissioner's Office is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to engagement with the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and the County and City Management Association (CCMA).  I can confirm that my Department is engaging positively and on an ongoing basis with the LGMA and the CCMA, as well as with any individual local authorities making separate contact, to clarify any queries arising and to assist those interested in availing of the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, details of the grant aid package are available on my Department's website www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address communitycctv@justice.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700061#WRE05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Properties","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700061#WRE05500"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[2109\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700061#WRE05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the refurbishment and reopening of Wicklow town courthouse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions. <\/p><p>However, a number of developments in relation to Courts Service accommodation requirements are outlined in the Government's recent National Development Plan 2018 - 2027.

The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.

A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase the overall strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members will be achieved by the target date of 2021. The Government fully supports the Commissioner&rsquo;s management decision which will ensure that increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; are available for frontline duties in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences crime or otherwise in 2019 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700062#WRF06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consumer Protection","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[2183\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of complaints lodged with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in each of the years 2015 to 2018, relating to the sale of tickets and or ticket touting practices; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition and consumer law in the State. <\/p><p>Section 9(5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including its day to day operational work regarding complaints made to it and I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, have no direct function in such matters.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, the CCPC have informed me of the aggregated figures for consumer and competition-related complaints in relation to ticketing by year that have been logged on their consumer contact line (supplied below). <\/p><p><b>Year  No. of complaints<\/b><\/p><p>2015104<\/p><p>2016220<\/p><p>2017332<\/p><p>2018350.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Eligibility","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[2208\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if entitlement to work in the case of persons (details supplied) can be transferred; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The Employment Permits Section of my Department inform me that the individual referred to by the Deputy does not currently hold an employment permit but may have immigration permission allowing the individual to work without an employment permit.

The Irish Research Council (under the Department of Education and Skills) launched the Frontier Research Programme or Laureate Awards in April 2017 with an initial fund of &euro;2.5 million, to support researchers to undertake project-based frontier research and to develop as Principal Investigators. A total of &euro;29.6 million was subsequently announced for investment by the Irish Research Council in &ldquo;frontier research&rdquo; projects in March, 2018.<\/p><p>As in previous years, the 2019 PRTLI allocation of &euro;24.3 million is being used to part pay outstanding bills for PRTLI Cycle 5 projects.  It also funds vital shared infrastructure essential to the third level research sector, including part payment of an annual subscription for e-Journals.  E-Journals funding provides Irish based scientists online access to a wide range of leading international scientific journals and is a necessary tool to enable them to conduct their own research. E-Journals formed part of the transfer of functions between my Department and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills as decided by Government order in May 2010. <\/p><p>In addition, some of this money will be used to allow for the commencement of dedicated funding for PhD\/Research Masters enrolment through the new Centres for Research Training.

The Government&rsquo;s ambition is for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader and this is the key vision of the Innovation 2020 Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The details supplied by the Deputy refer to the recent report published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The report highlights Ireland&rsquo;s gross Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;D) expenditure as a percentage of GDP compared with other EU member states. Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, signed up to the Europe 2020 Strategy in 2011. Under Europe 2020, Ireland committed to raise gross (public and private) investment in R&amp;D to 2.5% of GNP by 2020. We reiterated this commitment in Innovation 2020.  Ireland determined to use GNP as the intensity rate denominator and not GDP due to the effects of foreign owned companies on our economy.<\/p>  <p>  The key Innovation 2020 commitment to increase public and private investment in RDI to 2.5% of GNP by 2020 is challenging and it is unlikely that we will meet this target within the given timeframe. <\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Strategy in 2015, direct Exchequer funding of RDI has increased steadily- from &euro;736m in 2015 to an estimated &euro;751.7m in 2018. This is the highest level of public expenditure on RDI since 2012. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Irish economy is experiencing far higher economic growth than most other European countries. This is one of the main reasons for our lack of progress on the RDI intensity rate. In 2018, Ireland&rsquo;s GDP grew by 7.8%, the fastest in the EU.<\/p>  <p>  It is noted that only four member states have reached their Europe 2020 targets and the EU as a whole remains below its target of 3% of GDP.<\/p>  <p>  The Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP intensity rate of 1.05% of GDP for 2017 from the Eurostat report is calculated using preliminary figures for Business Expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) and Higher Education Expenditure on R&amp;D (HERD). Surveys on both are currently being compiled and are due to be published later this year from the Central Statistics Office and my Department respectively and will give the full picture on RDI expenditure for 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In October 2018 my Department published the Research &amp;amp; Development Budget 2017-2018 which estimated that GERD as a percentage of GDP was 1.15% in 2017. The figure for the GERD as a percentage of GNP for 2017 was 1.46%.<\/p>  <p>  The report showed that in 2017, the business sector contributed 71% of Ireland&rsquo;s gross expenditure on RDI, the third highest private investment figure in the EU. A very significant part of public policy has been to align our efforts in a manner that maximises the capacity to leverage RDI activity in the enterprise sectors. We are frequently cited as one of the most R&amp;D-effective countries in the EU, maximising innovation output per euro of public funding.<\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020 recognises that innovation is central to ensuring that our enterprise base is resilient and internationally competitive and a key goal is to increase enterprise engagement in RDI. Under the National Development Plan and as part of Project 2040, the Government launched the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, or DTIF, in 2018. It is being delivered through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and its agencies with a resource allocation of &euro;500 million over the period 2018-2027 consisting of an initial Exchequer allocation of &euro;180 million to 2022. As a first tranche, &euro;20 million will be allocated during 2019, which will leverage the same again in private sector matched funding. 27 projects have been announced from the first tranche of funding, worth &euro;75m to 2021. All projects include collaborations between start-ups, SMEs, multinationals and academic institutions. Every project involves at least one SME and many are led by an SME. Over the next ten years &euro;500 million will be allocated through the fund, which was announced as part of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  In the European Innovation Scoreboard 2018, Ireland remains in the category of &ldquo;Strong Innovator&rdquo; and has moved up a place to 9th in the EU. Ireland is placed first in three out of the ten dimensions considered - innovative SMEs, employment in knowledge-intensive activities and sales due to innovation activities. Ireland is ranked higher than 12 other member states that invest a higher amount of public funds as a percentage of GDP. Ireland has also retained 10th place in the Global Innovation Index, out of 126 countries assessed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":334,"content":"<p>Question No. 128 answered with Question No. 126.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG04400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Staff Remuneration","counter":335,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":336,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[2253\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700063#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures he plans to implement to improve the pay and conditions for nurses in the health service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":337,"content":"<p>The Government has already approved a range of measures that would improve the pay and conditions of nurses and midwives in the health service. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) is delivering wage increases of 6.4% to 7.2% over 2018-2020.

The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.

The Access Plan will also set out activity levels for the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) who, following an increase in funding in Budget 2019 to &euro;75 million, will supply additionality to HSE activity by arranging both insourced and outsourced appointments and treatments to reduce waiting times experienced by patients. <\/p><p>The Access Plan is being developed to ensure an appropriate balance between high volume activities and offering treatment to complex long waiting patients. The NTPF will do this by inviting public hospitals to seek solutions for very long waiters either in the private sector or through insourcing. The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate. In this context, the NTPF advises that a proposal to fund a further 100 cases in 2019 has recently been received from IEHG.  <\/p><p>In addition, the HSE advised my Department in late November 2018 that they had raised the issue of bariatric waiting times with both Saolta and Ireland East Hospital Groups.

It is acknowledged that GUH continue to be challenged in relation to theatre and bed capacity and in this context they have prioritized efforts to recruit additional staff including nursing staff and a senior dietician. <\/p><p>The HSE further advise that Galway University Hospital currently has two initiatives running with a focus on improving access to Obesity clinics.

The medical multi-disciplinary weight management component of the programme is delivered in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, whilst patients deemed suitable for surgery are referred to the surgical component of the programme in SVUH. <\/p><p>The patient pathway is such that all patients are initially referred to a Multi-Disciplinary Weight Management programme in SCH. Participants in the programme undergo a nine-month out-patient based multidisciplinary behavioural programme with input from dieticians, physio therapists and psychologists. Midway through the programme participants are assessed by the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) for suitability for surgery. <\/p><p>Since 2015 funding of &euro;300,000 has been allocated to SVUH to support the provision of bariatric surgery enabling on average 30 bariatric surgeries to be undertaken per annum.

That is why we propose to establish a statutory scheme for home care which will improve access to the service on an affordable and sustainable basis while also introducing a system of regulation that will ensure public confidence. <\/p>  <p>  Details of the breakdown of home support packages and number of home support hours per region is an operational matter for the HSE and this aspect of Deputy&rsquo;s request has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700065#WRJ05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital Expenditure","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700065#WRJ05700"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[2186\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700065#WRJ05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost of the proposed new national children's hospital; the reason the cost is higher than the original estimate; and the steps he plans to take to control the cost and to minimise the impacts on other capital projects.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":465,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[2228\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700065#WRJ05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated overall cost of the children&rsquo;s hospital; the cost expected to be incurred by the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":466,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 180 together.<\/p>  <p>  The children&rsquo;s hospital is one of the most complex and important public capital projects that this country has ever embarked upon. The hospital will facilitate the implementation of a new model of care that will have a profound impact on all paediatric services once the new hospital is open.<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken on the project since April 2017 when Government gave the green light for the construction of the hospital. Enabling works on the main hospital site are complete and Phase A construction works (substructure works on the main site), which commenced in October 2017, are also now nearing completion.  The Phase B 7-storey above ground works will begin early this year. Development is also well advanced on the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centres.  Works at Connolly are on target for practical completion of the building in the Spring with the opening scheduled for July 2019.  Works at Tallaght are underway with a target handover date of July 2020, and the construction of the main hospital to be completed in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  At an early stage in the process, it was determined that the traditional method of procurement was not suitable or realistic for a project of this size and complexity. Accordingly, the contract is subject to a two-stage process with stage one consisting of a scope refinement and value engineering process, based upon tendered rates, to finalise the Phase B works (above ground). This approach allowed the early phases of work to commence on site while also allowing for the detail of later phases to be finalised and agreed.  This approach brings issues on cost to the fore much earlier in the life of the project than is the case where traditional procurement approaches are deployed.<\/p>  <p>  Following the completion of the second stage of the two-stage tender procurement process, the final cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is responsible is now at &euro;1,433 million, &euro;450m more than advised to Government in April 2017.  &euro;319m of the additional cost relates to construction costs, and the balance of &euro;131m, which includes &euro;50m in VAT, relates to costs associated with staff, consultants, planning, design team fees, risk\/contingency, and Management Equipment Service.<\/p>  <p>  There have been conflicting total cost figures mentioned in the media over the last few days, in particular a reference to &euro;1.7 billion, and I would like to provide some clarity on the issue. &euro;1,433m is the capital build cost of the project. There is additional investment from other sources associated with broader programme which is outside of these capital costs. This relates to investment in ICT and the Electronic Health Record rollout funded through the ICT capital programme, the comprehensive Children's Hospital Integration Programme which is well underway, funded through revenue, to ensure the successful clinical and operational merging of three paediatric hospitals, pre-2013 project expenditure relating to the former Mater project, and the planned construction of the Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre to be funded through philanthropic funding.<\/p>  <p>  As I have already stated the increased cost is a matter of great concern and I have made it clear that Phase B of the construction project must be delivered within budget and timescale. Accordingly, there will be an independent review, commencing in January, of the escalation in cost in determining the adjusted contract sum, the contributory factors and associated responsibilities so that any potential weaknesses are identified and comprehensively and speedily resolved in the interests of the successful completion of the project and the effective management of public funds. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will be required to provide on-going assurance to the HSE, Department of Health and Government that Phase B of the project is being delivered within budget and timescale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700065#WRJ06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[2187\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting times for cervical smear test results; the number of tests which have timed out; and the steps he is taking to address the backlog.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>In May 2018, I asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements to provide that any woman who had had a CervicalCheck smear test, and whose GP considered that they should have a further test, to access such a further test without charge. This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April.  <\/p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. <\/p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and the HSE has advised that, currently, results of smear tests may take up to 20 weeks from the time of the test, and that it may take longer in a small number of cases. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. <\/p>  <p>  While the provision of out of cycle smears ceased on the 31 December 2018, it is important to be clear that this backlog will take some time to resolve. It remains a priority concern for me, for my Department and for the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Smear test samples must be sent to the laboratory and made into slides within six weeks of the smear test date. After six weeks, the sample is deemed expired and cannot be processed. Transferring slides to samples in this timeframe was being achieved by the laboratories used by CervicalCheck until they experienced a high demand on resources following the announcement of free repeat smear tests in April. In some cases, the increased volume resulted in a delay transferring samples to slides. <\/p>  <p>  However, as of 30 July 2018, the HSE has advised that the majority of smear test samples are now transferred to slides within the six week timeframe. There may be a small number of cases where the vial used to contain the sample expires before the laboratory has an opportunity to carry out the analysis of the sample and in some cases a sample may be insufficient. Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues. In such cases, a woman and her GP are advised of the need for a repeat test in three months&rsquo; time by letter from CervicalCheck. <\/p>  <p>  From April to October 2018 the rate of expired samples and vials was 0.29%. This compares with 0.25% for the same period in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific number of tests which have expired, this is a matter for the HSE and accordingly I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":471,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00500"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[2201\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card renewal will be concluded in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":474,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":475,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[2202\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if urgent steps will be taken in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":476,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[2209\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card renewal will be completed in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[2227\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of appointing a company (details supplied) to review the costs at the children&rsquo;s hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>Government has approved the commissioning of an independent review of the escalation in costs and the effective management of public funds. <\/p><p>This review is being commissioned by the HSE.

This includes research by Teagasc into, for example, the effects on the sector more widely as well as on farm incomes, by the ESRI, by the Department of Finance, by Copenhagen Economics and by Inter Trade Ireland, which looked at the potential impact of WTO tariffs on cross-border trade. All of the analyses undertaken to date show that Brexit will be unambiguously bad for the sector, particularly given the fact that the sector&rsquo;s regional spread underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in Ireland. The work is not based on a specific regional basis but analyses the overall sectoral impacts.<\/p>  <p>  The most immediate challenge for industry has been the impact caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro. A considerable amount of work has also been put into intensifying our market diversification efforts in order to reduce our exposure to the UK market.<\/p>  <p>  I have been addressing these challenges through a range of Budgetary measures aimed at improving competitiveness, and developing market and product diversification. These measures include a &euro;150m low-cost loan scheme in 2017 to help reduce farm-gate business costs, and a dedicated &euro;50m Brexit package in Budget 2018 which included further additional funding to Bord Bia and Teagasc as well as a contribution to a &euro;300m (joint DAFM\/DBEI) &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo;, at least 40% of which is available to food businesses. In Budget 2019 I announced a &euro;78m Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  On market and product diversification, the additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia has been used, inter alia, to conduct a market prioritisation exercise which is now informing our approach to market diversification activities, including the choice of destinations for Trade Missions. Product diversification has also been supported through additional funding of &euro;8.8 million to Teagasc to develop its National Food Innovation Hub, and funding to support investment in the prepared consumer foods sector. <\/p>  <p>  It has been clear from the beginning that a hard Brexit would be very damaging for the agri-food sector given the potential impact of WTO tariffs on trade. We have been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to these potential impacts, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required for the sector. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of agriculture, there is of course a toolbox available to assist with severe market disruption in the Common Market Organisation Regulation put in place during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency in 2013, and this will be part of the discussion. I am in regular and on-going contact with Commissioner Hogan on these issues. <\/p>  <p>  As regards contingency planning, my Department has been actively participating in the Whole-of-Government approach to preparedness and contingency planning. We have fed into the overall Government Contingency Action Plan which was published on 19 December, and we have been working very closely with colleagues in other Departments and agencies to address in particular the requirements that will arise in relation to the implementation at ports and airports of import controls on agri-food products coming from the UK.<\/p>  <p>  These requirements are significant, and arise in relation to the carrying out of documentary, identity and physical checks on imports of animals, plants, and products of animal and plant origin, as set out in EU legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Work in this regard has been focused on three key areas, namely, infrastructure, staffing and information technology, and in three key locations, that is Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport.<\/p>  <p>  On infrastructure, we have been engaging very closely with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Transport, the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the physical facilities that will be required to carry out import controls at the three locations. This work had been proceeding in any event in the context of dealing with the central case scenario, and has been adapted in order to meet the requirements in the event of a disorderly Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  On staffing, the Department is working very effectively with Customs and others to provide the resources needed to apply the necessary controls, and I am confident that the state will be in a position to apply controls at the appropriate time.  <\/p>  <p>  On information technology, my Department has established a project to coordinate the identification and delivery of ICT Infrastructure and systems to support the additional requirements of staff engaged in control processes in Dublin Port, Rosslare and Dublin Airport. The delivery timelines in the event of a disorderly Brexit are extremely challenging, but officials are working with the greatest urgency to ensure that the required ICT services are in place by 29 March 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout all of this work, the focus of the Department will continue to be on the need to discharge its legal responsibilities while ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700066#WRK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700067#WRL00300"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[2254\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700067#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount spent in each year for the past five years on accountancy and consultancy firms in relation to capital projects; the specific capital project in which the costs were incurred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy on the amount spent in each of the past five years on consultancy firms in relation to capital projects can be found in the following tables.

Ireland was the first EU Member State to be granted beef market access to the USA in 2015. In July 2016, my Department received approval to send Beef Intended for Grinding (BIFG), also known as manufacturing beef to the US. A total of 10 Irish plants have been approved for the export of raw intact beef to the US, of which 2 are also approved for BIFG. Ireland does not have access for processed beef, which may also be called manufactured beef. <\/p><p>Ireland has enjoyed uninterrupted access to the US market for raw pork since 2001 and a total of 3 plants are approved for the export of raw pork to the USA. <\/p><p>Sheepmeat exports from the EU to the US are currently banned due to the presence of TSE in certain EU Member States. Sheepmeat access to the USA will depend in the first instance on the USA lifting its TSE ban on EU Sheepmeat. My Department submitted a sheepmeat questionnaire (SRT) in 2017 in preparation for the lifting of this ban and continues to raise this issue with US officials, both as part of the Trade Missions to the USA and with visiting US officials to Ireland. However, it is not possible to predict a timeline for sheepmeat market access to the USA.<\/p><p>The role of my Department is to open new markets and maintain existing markets for Irish food exports and overall targets are set out for agri-food exports in Foodwise 2025, in terms of an increase to &euro;19 billion by 2025. My Department works very closely with the meat and dairy industry but once a market has been opened trade arrangements are left to individual companies and exporters and the actual trade volumes will vary depending on a range of factors such as currency fluctuations, global supply and demand, and local and international factors.  <\/p><p>In 2018 Irish agri-food exports reached an estimated &euro;13.6 billion.

This plan aims to increase international market access for Irish food and drink exports and focuses on seven particular elements including barriers to trade. My Department actively works and engages with various competent authorities in third countries in order to try and remove various technical barriers to trade and to improve certification conditions. <\/p><p>In relation to meat, my Department has undertaken a review of existing export markets in which conditions of certification present barriers to trade or additional costs for exporters.  This review was carried out in collaboration with the industry. The work involved in this review is by its nature on-going and is subject to on-going review, again in collaboration with industry.<\/p><p>Barriers to trade tend to arise in relation to meat products rather than dairy and an example of the work around removing barriers to trade and improving certification conditions relates to the agreed bilateral veterinary health certificates for beef. During the period, since the launch of the Action plan, enhanced beef access has been achieved for the export of Irish Beef to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Africa as follows:<\/p><p>- Israel - the main changes from the previous certificate are that the new certificate provides for the export of bone-in beef cuts derived from cattle of all ages as well as boneless beef cuts and offal from cattle of all age. The previous certificate restricted exports to boneless beef only.<\/p><p>- Saudi Arabia -<b><\/b>the new certificate covers the export of beef and processed beef products including minced beef and cooked beef  <b><\/b><\/p><p>- Singapore  - the new  certificate provides for the export of boneless beef derived from cattle of all ages as well as bone-in beef from cattle aged less than thirty months. The previous certificate restricted exports to boneless beef only  derived from cattle aged less than thirty months.<\/p><p>- South Africa - the main change is that there is no longer a requirement that animals aged over 72 months be tested for BSE. <\/p><p>My Department has also launched an online Market Access portal which provides a one-stop-shop for detailed market access and export information on open agri-food markets around the world, <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The information on the portal includes certification arrangements, exporter terms and conditions, individual country trading statistics and the typical products exported to individual markets.

They play a significant role in stimulating price competition and provide an alternative market outlet for farmers. They are however commercial transactions which can be impacted on by various factors. My Department continues to engage with authorities in third countries to seek to agree market access and to agree relevant health certification requirements to facilitate such trade.<\/p><p>In 2018 live exports totalled 246,226 head of cattle, up 31% from 188,334 for on 2017.  This change was driven by a significant increase in exports to other EU countries.  Calf exports to Spain increased by 66%, to over 72,500 head in 2018. Exports of Irish calves to Italy and the Netherlands also increased last year, to over 12,500 and 48,500 head respectively.

Nevertheless, nearly 13,000 head of cattle were exported to Turkey last year.<\/p><p>In November my Department reached agreement with the Libyan authorities on veterinary health certificates for the export of breeding, fattening and slaughter cattle.  A new certificate for breeding cattle and an amended veterinary certificate for the export of fattening and slaughter cattle were agreed.  Having an agreed health cert for breeding cattle provides much more clarity for exporters, as previously exports of breeding cattle to Libya had to be agreed on a load by load basis.  The age of cattle that can be exported to Libya increased, from 24 to 30 months &ndash; this increases opportunities for exporters to export a wider range of cattle.  Live exports to Libya more than doubled in 2018 over 2017 to 5,450 head.<\/p><p>Details of all cattle exports in 2018 are set out in the following table. <\/p><p>In December 2018, Minister of State for Trade, Employment, Business, EU Digital Single Market and Data Protection, Pat Breen TD, discussed animal health certificates with the Egyptian Deputy Minister for Agriculture.

Decisions on all aspects will be informed by the final outcome of CAP negotiations at EU level, the available budget, empirical data and extensive stakeholder consultation.   The organisation referred to by the Deputy has made a submission as part of my Department's public consultation process. All such submissions will be considered in the context of developing a National CAP plan.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post-2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  My view is that such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I was pleased to secure  an allocation of &euro;20 million in the 2019 Budget for a new pilot scheme for suckler farmers, specifically aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of beef production. The Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP) will target the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves - measuring the liveweight of the calf at weaning as a percentage of the cow's liveweight. This data will be used to target improvements on a herd basis by giving the farmer detailed feedback on the performance of individual animals. The data collected will also be a valuable addition to Ireland's already impressive database on cattle genomics. <\/p>  <p>  I am also confident that suckler farmers will be significant beneficiaries of the additional &euro;23 million in funding which I announced in Budget 2019 for the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period. This will improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for beef farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups. Suckler farmers also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700067#WRL05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":572,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700067#WRL05300"},{"type":"question","counter":573,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[2287\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700067#WRL05400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on recent comments by the UK Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. George Eustice (details supplied); and if he has contacted his counterparts in the UK Government since these comments were made.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":574,"content":"<p>The reported comments by George Eustice MP are somewhat speculative in nature, and I would point out by way of counter-argument that, according to the UK National Beef Association, the UK is about 75% self-sufficient in beef. In addition, Bord Bia&rsquo;s recently published Export Performance and Prospects 2018\/2019 report, it states that exports of beef to the UK, continued to increase, increasing by 4% in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, retention of the UK market for the Irish beef and other sectors is a key component of the Government's response to Brexit. For example, the range of support measures that I have introduced over the last three budgets has been particularly aimed at cost reduction so that our producers can maintain their competitiveness to the maximum possible extent. In addition, I have met with the chief executives of all of the major British retailers to impress upon them the commitment of Irish suppliers in continuing to supply the UK market post-Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that the additional funding that I have provided to Bord Bia since the UK referendum - a total of &euro;19.5 million - is being used, among other things, to provide direct support and advice to individual companies in the context of its Brexit Barometer initiative, including in relation to how they can maintain customer relationships, and deal with supply chain and logistics challenges. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, the pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports, including beef exports, is an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming years. Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Gulf region. This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700067#WRL05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700068#WRM00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicle Grants","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700068#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[2068\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700068#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) who bought a 100% electric vehicle and applied for a grant was refused funding despite the vehicle complying with the conditions of the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is referring to the electric vehicle home charger grant which provide up to &euro;600 to support the installation of a home charger.

The total value of our trade using the landbridge has been estimated to be approximately &euro;21 billion. Goods using the landbridge include many time-sensitive or perishable goods, and are transported by truck on Roll-on \/ Roll-Off (&ldquo;RoRo&rdquo;) shipping services to and through the UK.  Dublin and Rosslare ports handle almost all of this traffic<\/p><p>In a no-deal scenario, the ease with which these movements of goods currently take place will no longer be guaranteed. Additional customs, agriculture and health controls will be required at EU ports that trade with the UK.  In the case of the landbridge route, the ports of Dublin, Rosslare, Holyhead and the Dover-Calais link are of paramount concern.  In Ireland, the OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners are already preparing by developing the necessary plans within Dublin and Rosslare Ports to allow for these controls. I am aware that similar preparations are ongoing in Calais. <\/p><p>The scale of the checks required will likely result in delays for goods moving through the ports but there is a focus on preventing congestion through the provision of appropriate measures. <\/p><p>The Brexit-related infrastructure work for both the no-deal and central case scenarios is focused on Dublin Port, Rosslare Port, and also Dublin Airport. This is based on an assessment of the scale of trade in goods that are moving between these locations and ports\/airports in the UK.  Other ports are separately assessing and planning for Brexit as part of the internal organisational functions.  Final costs of works for the establishment of additional controls in Dublin and Rosslare Ports have not yet been determined. Costs in relation to other ports are an operational matter for those ports.<\/p><p>Some trade currently using the landbridge route may, depending on the nature of the product, switch to the direct routes to the continent. For others, some delays at UK and other EU ports may not be such as to constitute a significant deterrent to the continued use of the landbridge. However, the use of the landbridge for some other products that are perishable or very time sensitive may become unviable and may also not be viable on the longer direct maritime links.  <\/p><p>The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) study into the implications of Brexit on the use of the landbridge, published last November, estimated that approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) travel between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge each year. This would equate to a weekly average of approximately 2,880 HGVs moving between Ireland and the continent via the landbridge, although there can be peak times within each week, and also on a seasonal basis.  <\/p><p>Officials from my Department have assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative for trade that currently takes place using the Landbridge. Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider stakeholders, my preliminary assessment is that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019, and should demand for further capacity arise, the shipping sector can respond quickly to meet such demands. I will, however, keep this under review and report back to Government with a further assessment before the end of February. I will keep under review, in particular the emerging picture in relation to the degree and nature of customs and SPS controls at domestic, UK and relevant EU ports and the likely impact on traffic flows.<\/p><p>A cross-departmental Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was established in October 2017 and has been working on measures aimed at ensuring the ongoing effective and efficient use of the landbridge post-Brexit. The EU has agreed that the UK may join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU <i>on 29 March 2019<\/i>, and a number of formal steps were taken to allow this to happen on 4 December 2018. This will enable the use of the EU&rsquo;s internal transit procedure. <\/p><p>In its communication of 19 December, the European Commission states that in case of no deal, simplified border controls, limited to documentary checks for instance, would apply to live animals and animal products coming from a Member State but transiting through the UK. This would reflect the fact that this would be considered an intra-EU (Single Market) transfer.<\/p><p>The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) has a range of supports available to business and details can be found on their website <i>www.dbei.gov.ie<\/i>. In addition, it has been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. <\/p><p>My Department is also working with Chambers Ireland to provide advice and information to their members throughout the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700068#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700068#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[2054\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019011700068#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when he expects the main construction work to commence at the Dunkettle interchange, County Cork; the expected duration of the works; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

On completion of the 6 month period, the tenant accrues specific protections under the Residential Tenancies Acts as long as the tenant complies with their own obligations.

Excessive usage is determined by reference to the threshold amount of 213,000 litres per household per annum as specified by ministerial order with effect from 1 January 2018, in line with provisions contained in sections 8 and 9 of the Water Services Act 2017.<\/p><p>Irish Water is responsible for developing and implementing the necessary administrative arrangements, including billing arrangements, subject to oversight and approval by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).  The amount to be charged will be determined by the CRU and I understand the process that is to lead to a decision in this regard will commence early in 2019.<\/p><p>Once administrative arrangements and charges have been approved by the CRU, Irish Water will be in a position later this year to notify relevant customers who, having regard to their consumption patterns during 2018, appear to be consuming water services excessively and therefore potentially liable for excessive usage charges.

On this basis, I understand that Irish Water will work proactively with relevant customers to identify whatever practical steps may be necessary in order to address their situation and bring their consumption back within the threshold level.
