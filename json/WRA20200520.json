We firmly believe that this is the only outcome which will provide long term security, freedom and prosperity to both peoples.\"<\/p>  <p>  The unilateral annexation by Israel of any part of the occupied Palestinian territory would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland or the international community more generally. I have in the past made my views on this clear to Israeli leaders, including during my most recent visit to Israel in December 2019. My officials continue to convey our views to the Israeli authorities at appropriate opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  The Middle East Peace Process, including the issue of annexation, was discussed at the 15 May videoconference meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. In advance of that meeting, I and senior officials in my Department discussed the issue with a large number of EU Member States to encourage a clear and united position. <\/p>  <p>  During the VC discussion, the strong view expressed was that annexation was completely unacceptable and, if implemented, would be a grave violation of international law. This is not just a principle that applies to Israel and Palestine but one which is global. I, and many other Ministers, emphasised the need for EU action to deter such a damaging unilateral action, which would inevitably have negative consequences for the EU-Israel relationship. There was broad agreement that the EU and its MS need to engage in outreach with the new Israeli Government and make clear our deep concerns.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the very clear statements that have been made on this matter in recent weeks by EU High Representative\/Vice President Josep Borrell, who has said that any annexation would constitute a serious violation of international law that could not pass unchallenged.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to prioritise this issue, working closely with EU partners and countries in the region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Cases","counter":85,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[6007\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding the human rights situation in Bahrain including the detention of political prisoners; if this situation has been discussed at EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[6325\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland will consider introducing a joint statement on Bahrain at the Human Rights Council in Geneva regarding that country&rsquo;s treatment of political prisoners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1477","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 33 together.<\/p>  <p>  The human rights situation in Bahrain remains a matter of concern. Although progress has been made in certain areas, there continue to be instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including the targeting of human rights defenders.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland participates actively in the UN Human Rights Council, and regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, both in national statements and in our support of EU Statements, which I believe is the right way to highlight this issue. <\/p>  <p>  Discussions are still ongoing on how the next session of the UN Human Rights Council will be held, in view of the current situation. No decision has yet been taken on national or EU interventions at that session. In our planning for the next session, we will consider carefully which priorities to set, with a view to focusing the weight of Ireland's efforts, and the Council's attention, on the most grave and troubling situations globally.  <\/p>  <p>  While the issue of Bahrain has not been raised at the EU Foreign Affairs Council recently, the EU and Bahrain hold regular discussions on human rights issues. At the most recent informal EU-Bahrain Human Rights dialogue in November 2019, issues discussed included the right to a fair trial, prison conditions (including the need to ensure adequate medical treatment for prisoners), and the overall human rights situation in the country. The EU continues to follow up directly with the Bahraini authorities; for example, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, recently wrote to the Bahraini Minister for Foreign Affairs specifically highlighting the ongoing detention of Human Rights defenders and the conditions of their detention. <\/p>  <p>  We also raise our concerns about the human rights situation, and the treatment of detainees in particular, in our bilateral discussions with Bahrain. When I met with the former Bahraini Minister of Foreign Affairs at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2019, I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. Officials from my Department met with a delegation from Bahrain in November 2019 and had an in-depth discussion on prison conditions and the justice system in Bahrain. Among the issues raised were Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the imprisonment of certain individuals, apparently on the basis of opinions they had expressed; and the provision of healthcare for prisoners in Bahrain. The Bahraini officials outlined specific plans to improve prisoners&rsquo; access to healthcare, and my officials continue to follow up on this matter. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":89,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":90,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[6105\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000107#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a service (details supplied) will resume; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":91,"content":"<p>The Passport Service is operating a limited service at this time which has allowed us to both reassign staff to our consular services, assisting our citizens abroad\u00a0and redeploy staff to critical areas including contact tracing for the HSE and Covid-19 payments for DEASP, all critical services at this time.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Passport Service continues to process emergency passports for our citizens at home and abroad in cases of emergency.\u00a0 Our WebChat service and a dedicated travel emergency mailbox continue to operate through which we can be contacted in such circumstances.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Passport Service will continue to follow Government guidelines regarding Covid-19.

They are illegal under international law, notably being contrary to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and actively undermine the prospects for a two-state solution. <\/p>  <p>  As I have said many times in the D&aacute;il, the regulation of international trade, including in relation to settlement goods, is a matter of exclusive EU competence. The Occupied Territories Bill asks the Government to do something which is not legally in its power. The European Commission confirmed to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence in June of last year that \"...the EU has exclusive competence on the common commercial policy, and that as a\u00a0customs union, the EU applies common arrangements for imports of goods from third\u00a0countries uniformly across the Union. In principle, only the EU can decide to prohibit the importation of goods and services and not the Member States individually.\" <\/p>  <p>  To introduce such an EU-wide ban on the importation of settlement goods would require consensus among EU Member States, and the political will for such a policy does not exist. For that reason, I have focused my energies at EU level on other aspects of the Israel-Palestine issue, in order to ensure the best possible policy outcomes. <\/p>  <p>  As it stands, however, EU law does already make a meaningful distinction between Israel, and settlements in occupied territory. This distinction has important practical effects. Since settlements are not part of Israel, the EU-Israel Association Agreement does not apply to them. This means that different tariffs apply to goods from settlements, and settlements are not eligible for participation in EU-Israel programmes. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been vigilant to ensure that EU law in this regard is upheld. For example, in 2018, Ireland, as an interested Member State, lodged observations in a case which was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union, challenging the implementation of EU rules on the labelling of foodstuffs originating from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. The court&rsquo;s judgment, issued on 12 November 2019, confirmed that foodstuffs originating in territories occupied by the State of Israel, must bear the indication of their territory of origin, and when these products originate from an Israeli settlement, this must also be made clear on the label. Clear and non-misleading indication of origin for certain goods is an essential part of the EU's consumer policy. <\/p>  <p>  EU law and guidelines on goods from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory clearly differentiate between settlements on the one hand, and Israel, on the other. As such, they are an important part of the EU constribution to the implmentation of UN Security Council Resolution 2334. Ireland will maintain its vigilance to ensure full implementation of these laws and guidelines.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Bodies","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[6990\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland will seek observer member status of the Arctic Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>In recent years, the Arctic has become a region of increasing geopolitical importance.\u00a0 The growing environmental and strategic importance of the Arctic has very significant impact, with melting ice having far-reaching implications for climate change and maritime access across the region. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been undertaking a mapping exercise to assess Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the Arctic and related issues across a range of areas and to determine the merits of a closer engagement with the region.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is clear there is a rationale for enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s engagement on the Arctic across the range of established fora, including the potential to submit an application for observer status with the Arctic Council.\u00a0 It is clear that any application would have to be underpinned by a very strong case detailing how Ireland could contribute to the Council&rsquo;s work.

In that regard it is noted that as of 14 May, over 54,100 employers and over 464,400 employees have thus far benefited from the measure.  <\/p>  <p>  It ultimately gives a sum to employers to cover a portion of their wage bill in circumstances where the employer&rsquo;s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  The sum the employer receives is based on the employees who were on their payroll on 29 February 2020, the net salary such employees received in January and February 2020, as well as the extent to which the employer remains able to continue to discharge their legal obligation to pay their employees&rsquo; salaries.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue.  One of the core principles of the scheme that is necessary to prevent abuse is the requirement that the employees for which a claim is submitted must be on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020.  Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after 29 February 2020, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, whether maternity related or otherwise, that salary cannot be included in the calculation of the sum that is available to the employer under the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  The 29 February payroll decision has consequences for many groups, however, the scheme is being administered in a manner that is fully compliant with all relevant legislation and no discriminatory treatment of workers arises.  <\/p>  <p>  Further, the position in relation to the TWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay.  The question of an individual&rsquo;s employment entitlements following their resumption of work after a period of leave, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters between the employee and the employer &ndash; and the entire period of pregnancy and maternity leave is a special protected period under the law.  <\/p>  <p>  It is understood that although the employer may not be able to claim the TWSS for a person who has not been on the payroll on 29 February but is entitled to return to work after this date, they remain obliged to honour their obligations as an employer as the full suite of employment rights legislation continues to apply in relation to all employees and their employers for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the operation of the TWSS, I am aware of the matter that has been raised by the Deputies and have instructed officials to re-examine whether such workers may be accommodated at this time within the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":134,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[5564\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if cr&egrave;ches that filed their P30 form and other documentation before 1 April 2020 are eligible for full payment under the temporary wage subsidy scheme.","asker":"1484","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":135,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s priority in so far as the Temporary Wages Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is concerned was and is to ensure that all employers experiencing significant negative economic disruption from COVID-19 can register for and start to receive payment quickly. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that the relationship between employers and employees is maintained to the greatest extent possible so that businesses can restart operations quickly once that becomes possible. The scheme is available to eligible employers across all sectors, excluding the public service and non-commercial semi-state sector, this includes businesses that have closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions and those that continue to operate and employ their workforce.\u00a0The\u00a0main eligibility criteria for the scheme are that:<\/p>  <p>  - the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic;<\/p>  <p>  - the employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020; and, <\/p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that following a review of cases since the TWSS commenced, it became apparent that a number of employers have been unable to access the scheme because they failed the 15 March 2020 rule, but had qualified under all other conditions of the scheme and were otherwise tax compliant.\u00a0Given the purpose  of the scheme, Revenue decided, under its care and management provisions, to allow such employers access the scheme provided: <\/p>  <p>  - the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020<\/p>  <p>  - the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted to Revenue before 1 April 2020, and<\/p>  <p>  - the payroll submissions for all previous months were submitted to Revenue before 15 March 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSS builds on payroll data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. Where a business qualifies for the TWSS under the revised criteria, the wage subsidies under the scheme are payable for eligible employees in respect of payroll submissions made on or after 24 April 2020, with a pay date on or after 24 April 2020, and are not retrospective.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Eligible employers can participate in the scheme in respect of any eligible employees on their payroll at 29 February 2020, including rehired staff who had been temporarily laid off after that date.\u00a0Where an employee previously laid off has been re-hired, the employee will qualify for the scheme once their claim for social welfare benefit (Pandemic Unemployment\u00a0Payment\/Jobseekers Benefit) is ceased.

In this regard, I held a teleconference meeting with a representative from the Alliance for Insurance Reform on 1 April to hear the concerns of their membership.<\/p><p>I, and my officials, have been engaging with the insurance sector in an effort to get some much needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on the 27th of March and indicated amongst other things the following: <\/p><p>(i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.  <\/p><p>(ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed, as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.<\/p><p>Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on the 3rd of April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close. <\/p><p>Following on from my correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on the 17th of April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating their customers fairly. I also discussed a range of other insurance related matters on the teleconference, including motor insurance premium refunds, and a statement outlining the nature of my engagement with Insurance Ireland was issued by the Department and can be found here:   <\/p><p>In addition, the Deputies should note that the Central Bank wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. The key messages that the Bank conveyed are as follows:<\/p><p>- Insurers must put forward consumer-focussed solutions on policy payment breaks, rebates and claims. <\/p><p>- While most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. <\/p><p>- The Central Bank expects the CEOs of Irish authorised firms to take responsibility for the oversight of how their firm is managing determinations of whether claims are covered or not in the context of COVID-19. <\/p><p>I also understand that the Central Bank is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p><p>In conclusion on this issue, I have already set out to the House that I strongly believe that insurers should treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally and honour those elements of the policies covered including business interruption claims in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.  The Deputies should note however that neither I, as Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank have any role in adjudicating on such matters.  If there continues to be a disagreement between an insurer and a policyholder, then the appropriate channels for resolving them must be followed i.e. use of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or litigation.<\/p><p>With regard to the other issue raised on insurance cover for businesses required to close during the Covid-19 emergency, I and my officials have also had extensive engagements with the industry.  In that regard, it should be noted that in my letter of the 27th of March, I also requested that Insurance Ireland press its members to provide some reliefs to their customers to alleviate the pressures brought on as a result of the current situation and for insurers to have a common approach on how they are supporting their business customers in this difficult time.  The outcome of this engagement is an agreement that I announced on the 10th of April whereby most of the key insurers in the Irish market - namely Allianz, AIG, AXA, FBD, Liberty Insurance, RSA, Travelers Insurance and Zurich - will apply the following common measures which will be available to their business customers:<\/p><p><b>Forbearance<\/b><\/p><p><b>- <\/b>Insurers will reduce premiums for business customers to reflect reduced level of exposure as a result of COVID-19 restrictions for Employer Liability\/ Public Liability and Commercial Motor.<\/p><p>- Insurers will allow up to 28 days after renewal for payment.  <b><\/p><p>Business Premises<\/b><\/p><p>- Insurers will maintain cover for unoccupied commercial buildings\/ premises not in use due to COVID-19 restriction (for a maximum of 90 days). Appropriate supervision and security of the premises is required.  <\/p><p>- Insurers will support requests for a change of property use during the crisis.<\/p><p>It is important that businesses contact their insurers or brokers to avail of these offers.  <\/p><p>In terms of this agreement, I believe that it should provide some assistance to businesses.  I have asked Insurance Ireland to put in place a mechanism, which will provide proof of delivery on these commitments.  My view, is that it is in Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s interest to put in place a credible tracking mechanism, as they need to be able to demonstrate that the 10 April agreement is being implemented properly.  I have also asked my officials intend to monitor the implementation of the agreement, both through the activity tracker, as well as through the regular engagement with other relevant stakeholders such as the Alliance for Insurance Reform.<\/p><p>Finally, with regard to any further engagement with the insurance industry, it should be noted that my officials are in regular contact with Insurance Ireland and the Central Bank and keep me updated on developments. For now, while I don't have any meeting arranged with individual insurance company CEOs, I am keeping that issue under review as matters develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Building Finance Ireland","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[6153\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000108#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if an application will be reviewed and approved (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>HBFI was established, in January 2019, to increase the availability of funding for the residential development market.

As of 30 April, the Governing Council of the ECB has set the entry rate on the TLTRO programme to be -0.5%. The interest rate then decreases on a scale depending on developments in a bank&rsquo;s eligible lending. The minimum rate on the borrowing can be as low as -1% if a bank exceeds its lending benchmark for eligible lending. <\/p>  <p>  Access to TLTRO funding is available to banks across the euro area, including to Irish banks, but is optional and is a decision for a bank itself to make. Up to now, take-up from Irish banks in previous TLTRO programs has been limited. Importantly, the TLTRO program does not specify the interest rate at which the bank lending to business (or households) should take place.\u00a0 However, banks do not just use TLTRO to fund their activity. In practice they utilise a diverse range of funding sources, including consumer deposits, which are relatively more expensive for the bank compared to the funding available under TLTRO.<\/p>  <p>  Neither the Central Bank of Ireland, the ECB, nor the Government plays a role in determining the interest rate on a loan from a private bank in Ireland. However, one would always expect a spread above borrowing costs to reflect various costs associated with lending, such as credit risk premia, operating costs including credit assessment, and the cost of equity. All of these factors are particularly high in the Irish SME lending market.\u00a0 Banks are also required to hold an adequate level of capital against SME lending this also contributes to the interest rates charged by banks.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, banks are offering a payment break up to six months for business and personal customers affected by Covid-19. A payment break as a response to COVID-19 is not identified specifically on credit reports. If a lender agrees to a payment break with no payments at all, then no &ldquo;missed payments&rdquo; will be submitted to the Central Credit Register by the lender during this period.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a suite of measures to assist SMEs during these difficult times. These include measures to help viable businesses access the liquidity that they require. There is a range of Government supports available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. &euro;200 million is currently available for COVID 19 affected customers through the SBCI COVID19 Working Capital Scheme.\u00a0 The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, has recently announced the expansion of two SBCI Loan Schemes by &euro;450m to provide an extra &euro;250m for working capital and &euro;200m for longer-term loans, bringing the total allocation to support liquidity in companies affected by the COVID-19 crisis to &euro;650m. The SBCI also has existing supports in place that can help SMEs, including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, which has current lending capacity for SMEs. The Credit Guarantee Scheme supports lending through the provision of an 80% Government Guarantee for qualifying businesses.\u00a0 The Microfinance Ireland Loan Scheme has also introduced loans of up to &euro;50,000 for micro-SMEs affected by COVID 19.\u00a0 The expansion of Microfinance Ireland funding by &euro;13m to &euro;20m for COVID-19 loans has also been recently announced with interest rates falling from 7.8% to 4.5%.

The background to this decision was a series of meetings with the major insurers where significant concerns were expressed about the early implementation of certain aspects of the Act.\u00a0 Specifically, it was indicated to me that sufficient time would be needed in relation to the implementation of Sections 8 (Pre&ndash;contractual duties of consumer and insurer) and Section 12 (Renewal of contract of insurance). \u00a0In addition, Sections 9 (Proportionate remedies for misrepresentation) and 14 (Duties of consumer and insurer at renewal) are sufficiently interrelated with Section 8 that it is reasonable to consider that the concerns expressed also apply to these sections.

Officials understand that such a development would most likely to impact the employer\/public liability part of the market.

Urgent action needed to be taken to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. <\/p>  <p>  However, the legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it had to be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.\u00a0 Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits. <\/p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies has been used to protect and create jobs and this helped to\u00a0improve the\u00a0financial and economic position of the State.

While interest rates in Ireland remain higher than in many other European countries, there has been significant reduction in interest rates on new mortgage lending over the last 4-5 years. For example, the new business interest rate, excluding negotiations, on loans with fixations over one year, was 4.02% at Jan 2015 and is now 2.72%. These are significant reductions that benefit borrowers greatly over loan lifetimes. <\/p>  <p>  A number of important factors determine the interest rates charged on mortgages. These include the fact that the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks and capital requirements (which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience), operating costs, structural factors (for example the offering of cashback and other incentives in the Irish market) and weak competition in the domestic mortgage market. However, neither the Central Bank nor I have a statutory role to prescribe the lending, or indeed deposit, rates charged or paid by commercial banks or other commercial lenders.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has put in place a range of measures in order to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage.\u00a0 The consumer protection framework requires\u00a0lenders to be\u00a0transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle; for example, through protections at the initial marketing\/advertising stage, in assessing the affordability and suitability of the mortgage and at a time when borrowers may find themselves in financial difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  In particular, the Central Bank introduced of a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders.

Last month the NTMA successfully borrowed &euro;6 billion in the bond market for 7 years at less than &frac14; of 1 percent.<\/p><p>The interest rate environment remains accommodative owing to European Central Bank policy action and the introduction of its &euro;750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the actions of the European Central Bank (ECB), I have previously welcomed its monetary policy response to the pandemic, and particularly the PEPP and greater flexibility in its refinancing operations. \u00a0I expect banks to use the positive effects of these measures to support the economy and I know that the Central Bank of Ireland shares this view. \u00a0In terms of changes to ECB operations, I should point out that Article 130 of the Treaty for the European Union sets out that Government must respect the independence of the European Central Bank and not seek to influence its decisions.<\/p><p>Finally, I agreed with my fellow Euro&ndash;area finance Ministers the features and standardised terms of the European Stability mechanism (ESM) Pandemic Crisis Support instrument. This ESM instrument has been tailored to meet the challenges of this crisis and will provide a safety net\u00a0of\u00a0c.&euro;240 billion\u00a0for Euro-area Member States.<\/p><p>I consider this instrument to be an important and credible safety net for the euro area, both in terms of its magnitude and availability to all euro area Member States, however, I do not envisage that Ireland will avail of this instrument for the reasons I have already set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000111#WRG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":309,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 answered with Question No. 61.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000111#WRG02400"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[6434\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000111#WRG02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the tax credit given to the carers of incapacitated persons will be increased in view of the fact that carers are providing full-time care and attention and will have no entitlement to a contributory State pension in due course; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1552","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>There are a number of tax credits and reliefs available to individuals who are carers of incapacitated persons.<\/p><p>The Incapacitated Child Tax Credit is a tax credit of &euro;3,300, which can be claimed by a person in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education.\u00a0More information is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website: <i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-05.pdf<\/i>. <\/p><p>The Home Carer Tax Credit is available to married couples or civil partners that are jointly assessed, where one spouse or civil partner stays at home to take care of a dependent person.

Their website also includes a car insurance shopping around checklist and other tips on cutting car insurance costs which may prove useful to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000111#WRG04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000111#WRG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[6619\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000111#WRG04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if employees enrolled in the TWSS will have non-statutory deductions automatically reapplied after exiting the scheme while remaining in employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)\u00a0is provided for\u00a0in section 28 of the recently enacted Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020).\u00a0 Of necessity, the underlying legislation and the scheme itself have been developed very quickly, having regard to the overarching, urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees, where businesses have been seriously affected by the pandemic and the necessary restrictions introduced to fight the spread of the Covid-19 virus.<\/p>  <p>  The intention of the TWSS is to maintain employees&rsquo; net income as close as possible to normal net income and to ensure that the employees receive the full subsidy payment value.\u00a0 Non-statutory payroll deductions, for example, credit union deductions, union fees, etc., are normally deducted from net pay after tax.

The <i>In This Together<\/i>campaign draws together the huge range of advice and support that is available for people of all ages. To support the wellbeing and mental health of our Leaving Certificate students at this time, a dedicated page on the <i>In This Together<\/i>site contains online advice for Leaving Certificate students.  This webpage includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, stress and anxiety, developed by NEPS. The webpage also includes links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. It is recognised that some vulnerable groups of students may require a more focused, stepped-up level of intervention and the Department has worked with the Department of Health and HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for those students. A planning group has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Health and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE, and the NGO sector, in recognition of the fact that prior to, during and following national emergencies there is a need to support certain members of the population with their emotional, cognitive, social and physical needs. <\/p><p>The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.  These services augment the work of NEPS and assist students who may be feeling anxious at this time. In addition, additional support services have been identified for the general population that can assist students and their families at this time. <\/p><p>During this challenging time the school building may be closed but schools have structures in place to support students. It has often been the case, that the first port of call for Leaving Certificate students who are experiencing distress has been their school. Schools have developed excellent and flexible systems of support. Many schools have a designated Student Support Team, while other schools have equivalent systems and structures, but may use different terminology to describe their arrangements, such as &lsquo;Care Team&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pastoral Care Team&rsquo;. Either way, the structures schools have in place will continue to have a key role identifying issues and students for discussion by the Student Support Team with appropriate action\/ follow-up. In these uncertain times, the familiarity of these school structures and personnel will offer continuity and reassurance to students. A guidance document for Post-Primary Schools on supporting the wellbeing of students and the role of Student Support Teams has been published by my Department.<\/p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to be available to provide advice and support to school principals, teachers and school communities. NEPS provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for students with identified difficulties and in signposting to more specialist support, when needed, including onward referral to the HSE and other local mental health services.  <\/p><p>NEPS is proactively exploring a number of innovative ways to continue to provide educational psychological services to school communities at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000113#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Administration","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000113#WRJ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[6023\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000113#WRJ03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to ensure that private bus operators that undertake school runs will be provided the same 50% payment as those operating under Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts.","asker":"1451","askee":"1548"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[6370\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000113#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if taxi drivers subcontracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to drive a taxi on a school run are to be recompensated by 70% of their earnings and not the 50% they are currently receiving;

The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including\u00a0where\u00a0a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or\u00a0where there are\u00a0newly\u00a0enrolling pupils\u00a0to the school.<\/p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p><p>Accordingly, a\u00a0number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p><p>A process\u00a0is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule each year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify\u00a0for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy\u00a0received an additional allocation for the 2019\/20 school year to take account of the fact that the school had increased enrolments.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process\u00a0is available where schools can\u00a0seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>This school referred to in this question also\u00a0made an application to the NCSE for a review of the schools allocation of special education teachers on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising in the school.<\/p><p>The NCSE has completed the review of the school and has now made an additional allocation to the school.<\/p><p>This school currently has an allocation of 132 Special Education Teaching hours.

A working group on mitigating educational disadvantage is supporting on-going responses to what is an evolving situation, to ensure the continuation of crucial funding sources such as SUSI grants, the 1916 Bursary Scheme, the Student Assistant Fund, Fund for Students with a disability and other allowances. All stakeholders in this group have worked to support learners without access to sufficient technology and to ensure the continuation of services offered by access and disability offices, guidance counsellors and counselling services. <\/p><p>My Department is conscious of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.<\/p><p><b>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: <\/b><\/p><p><b>SUSI<\/b><\/p><p>- Student grant payments for academic year 2019\/20 will continue as normal. The duration and value of the grant will not change. <\/p><p>- Student grant applications for academic year 2020\/21 will be assessed based on income earned in 2019. <\/p><p>- If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.<\/p><p>- The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.<\/p><p>- The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).<\/p><p><b>Student Assistance Fund<\/b><\/p><p>- The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.\u00a0 Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018\u00a0a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund\u00a0for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty.

The way these two sources of information are used is interconnected.<\/p>  <p>  The first of the two further sources of information for the National standardisation process is the Junior Cycle\/Certificate actual marks attained by the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 taking a particular subject in the given school, and the second is about the general pattern of results in the subject from Leaving Certificate classes in that school over a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  This information will all be assembled and will be used to predict the level of achievement that this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate group would have been expected to reach in that subject if they had sat the Leaving Certificate examination in the normal way. This means that if a given class is a particularly &ldquo;strong class&rdquo;, the expected level of achievement of that class would reflect that fact and so the National standardisation process will take full account of it. If the school&rsquo;s estimated marks reflect this properly, then there will not be a need to move them up or down.<\/p>  <p>  Research and statistics allow my Department to understand the extent to which groups of students in a school have results that are similar from one year to the next. These sources also allow my Department to take account of the fact that individuals within those groups can have levels of achievement that can vary quite a lot.<\/p>  <p>  The information about each individual and their peers is combined with the information about the school&rsquo;s previous results and previous groups to allow checks that the marks and rankings for each subject in a school and all other schools are reasonable. This means that all candidates across the country are treated fairly.<\/p>  <p>  Most importantly, I can confirm that the statistical process being applied will not impose any predetermined score on any individual in a class or school.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000119#WRT02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1548"},{"type":"question","counter":742,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[6232\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000119#WRT02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to ensure that the appeals process for calculated grades for leaving certificate students will be transparent and that details of the way in which the determination is reached is made available to the pupil; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1548"},{"type":"question","counter":743,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[6725\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000119#WRT02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if clarity will be provided regarding the leaving certificate exams appeal process; the date from which students can appeal their exam results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1548"},{"type":"speech","counter":744,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 359 together.<\/p><p>As part of the calculated grades process where a student is not satisfied with their calculated grade it can be appealed to my Department.

The increase to the levy was accompanied by a programme of reforms in how the NTF is managed, evaluated and reported on.<\/p><p>An independent review of the National Training Fund was commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills as part of the package of reforms and this review was published by the Minister for Education and Skills on 17 August 2018.  The report made 14 specific recommendations across 4 key areas:<\/p><p>- Reform of the future direction of the NTF.<\/p><p>- Utilising the NTF to support investment in Higher Education.<\/p><p>- Enhancing enterprise engagement and input to NTF priorities.<\/p><p>- Improvements in monitoring\/evaluation of the NTF<\/p><p>An Implementation Plan to deliver these recommendations was published alongside the announcement of Budget 2019 along with details of a new NTF advisory group. This advisory group is a permanent resourced structure to optimise enterprise engagement on NTF priorities. The membership of the group consists of key stakeholders from the enterprise sector, Department officials, and bodies who have a strategic and oversight role in delivery of skills provision. The Group has met on three occasions in 2019 and have informed the priorities and direction of funding from the NTF for Budget 2020.  <\/p><p>In recent years, there has been a need to change and rebalance the suite of funded programmes to reflect the changing labour market conditions and areas of skills needs. Programmes are now more focused on labour market skill needs across higher education, further education and training and other partners. The NTF Advisory Group has been considering the implications for the Fund in light of the transformed economic and labour market landscape arising from COVID-19 and have fed into the overall skills policy as part of the immediate response to the current crisis and also the future world of work. <\/p><p><b>Amount Collected from the NTF Levy 2018 &ndash; April 2020<\/b><\/p><p>The NTF levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners as part of the PRSI collection system. The funds collected is included in the transfer of gross PRSI from the Revenue Commissioners to the Social Insurance Fund of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP). Each year DEASP undertakes an apportionment exercise to analyse PRSI collection data and to apportion funds to the Social Insurance Fund; the Health Levy and the National Training Fund.<\/p><p>At the end of April 2020, the National Training Fund had received &euro;261m in respect of NTF levy receipts.  This would represent the contributions from employers in respect of the four months from December 2019 to March 2020. The following table shows the income generated by the levy from 2018 to 2020. In the 2020 Revised Estimates for the Public Service, the levy is profiled to collect &euro;823m, although this estimate was made before the current COVID-19 crisis. NTF income is now likely to be significantly reduced given the economic impact of COVID-19.

It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.<\/p><p>The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. <\/p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning.

These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: <\/p><p>Student grant payments for academic year 2019\/20 will continue as normal. The duration and value of the grant will not change. <\/p><p>Student grant applications for academic year 2020\/21 will be assessed based on income earned in 2019. <\/p><p>If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. Following such a review, the applicant may fall within the thresholds to become eligible for grant assistance or be entitled to an increased rate of grant or the special rate of grant.<\/p><p>The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.<\/p><p>The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years).<\/p><p>The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards the rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. The total allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million which includes an additional &euro;1m added to the Fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone-parents or members of the other access target groups.\u00a0 Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. In December 2018\u00a0a further &euro;1 million was added to the Fund\u00a0for students attending Professional Masters of Education courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This funding continued into 2019 and 2020. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the funding allocation for the student grant scheme and the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) is\u00a0determined in the context of the overall estimates and budgetary process undertaken by all Government Departments.\u00a0 However, all proposals made in relation to education expenditure will be considered in the context of Budget 2021, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.\u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

It will combine estimates of a student&rsquo;s expected performance \u00a0in a subject and level, with information about how students in the school have fared in this subject in recent years in line with national performance standards over time. <\/p>  <p>  The first source of data will be provided by the subject teacher. It will then be aligned in the school, with teachers consulting on the results before the school&rsquo;s principal reviews the process applied to assure the fair treatment of students. The school then sends the data to my Department.<\/p>  <p>  A detailed document A Guide to Calculated Grades for Leaving Certificate students 2020 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. It explains further how the system will work. Detailed guidance for teachers on the operation of the calculated grades system is being finalised for issue to schools shortly.<\/p>  <p>  There will be strong oversight and control and a number of inherent quality assurance measures to ensure students receive as fair a result as possible. The principles of equity, fairness and objectivity are paramount in the calculated grades system. Teachers are to focus objectively on information that is clearly about attainment in the subject and not about other factors such as the student&rsquo;s background or circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Teachers are being asked to draw on existing records and other available evidence, to provide a fair, reasonable and carefully considered judgement of the most likely percentage mark that each student would have achieved if they had sat their examinations and completed coursework under normal conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Teachers will use a number of records in assessing a student&rsquo;s performance and progress; for example, classwork and homework; class assessments; examinations in school at Christmas or summer, mock exams and also coursework. They will not be simply passing on results from mock examinations or other tests. Junior Cycle results are not being used at an individual student level as a prediction of a student&rsquo;s likely performance in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate.<\/p>  <p>  The teacher&rsquo;s judgement will be based on evidence of learning and achievement such as that indicated above up until the point of school closure on the evening of 12 March. Teachers will not set additional assessments for the purposes of determining an estimated percentage mark.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of coursework that has already been completed, a teacher&rsquo;s overall estimate should incorporate the mark they think that this coursework would have achieved if it had been marked in the usual way.<\/p>  <p>  If a teacher has a real or perceived conflict of interest with a student in their class they must declare this to the school principal. There will be additional oversight by a nominated teacher and a deputy principal in such cases.<\/p>  <p>  Where a student is studying one or more subjects outside of a recognised school, the Department will be flexible in accepting estimated marks and rankings from other schools or colleges, and will look at this issue on a case-by-case basis. In general, I can say that, provided an estimated mark and ranking can be generated from a teacher in a way that is fair to all candidates, my Department will seek to provide a calculated grade. Students will be able to use this calculated grade in the same way as a Leaving Certificate grade to satisfy minimum entry requirements.<\/p>  <p>  When it was thought possible to hold written examinations but not orals or music performance tests, 100% marks were awarded for the cancelled orals and performance tests. \u00a0Awarding 100% for orals and music performance tests in the calculated grade system would not be fair to students. Calculated grades are the best way of getting an accurate estimation of what a student would have achieved across all components of their examination. <\/p>  <p>  Teachers of languages will assess the student&rsquo;s oral performance as well as their written skills to come to an estimated mark for each student. It was never intended to offer 100% for all practical or project work. Detailed guidance to assist teachers in formulating the estimated grade for each student will issue shortly and will address these components.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of students who are entered to take their examinations through Irish, the teacher will base the estimate of the student&rsquo;s likely performance on the assumption that this bonus is included in the estimate.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the thousands of students who have applied to study in Northern Ireland, Britain, Europe and elsewhere. Contacts with the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland continue, as well as contacts with officials in the other devolved Governments in the UK.

This was formally adopted by Member States on 16 April 2020 and it illustrates how to ensure continuity of procedures as much as possible while fully ensuring the protection of people&rsquo;s health, given the healthcare measures introduced by Member States.<\/p><p>The Commission advices are that in order to prevent and contain the spread of Covid-19, public health measures such as medical screening, social distancing, quarantine and isolation should be applied as necessary for third-country nationals, including applicants for international protection, resettled persons or third-country nationals illegally staying in the Union provided that these measures are reasonable, proportionate and non-discriminatory. <\/p><p>In line with the EU Commission guidance I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to follow HSE and Public Health guidelines in relation to measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 within our Direct Provision accommodation system and our international protection system generally. We will continue to follow the Commission&rsquo;s guidance as regards asylum measures in the context of the pandemic as appropriate to Ireland. For example, Ireland continues to accept new asylum applications as normal as per the EU advices. <\/p><p>As regards our Direct Provision system, together with the HSE, we have put in place a range of measures in all of the Department&rsquo;s Accommodation Centres to address any cases of Covid-19 if or when they arise.\u00a0 This includes provision for self-isolation facilities in Centres and a number of offsite self-isolation centres around the State. \u00a0In all matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic, we work collaboratively with the HSE to implement their public health advice. <\/p><p>We are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.<\/p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my Department has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.<\/p><p>The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. We have opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities (with capacity for 299 people) in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. <\/p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.\u00a0 <\/p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The vast majority of the rooms in the new accommodation being used to support social and physical distancing are twin rooms accommodating two people. If any person is being accommodated in these locations based on an identified vulnerability (age or medical condition), they have their own bedroom and their own bathroom to facilitate their cocooning.<\/p><p>We have cocooned all residents over the age of 65 and anyone advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness. <\/p><p>In addition to the formal guidance provided by the EU Commission, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), will continue to assess how the Covid-19 pandemic affects asylum services within Member States.

There are now also 19 Garda staff,\u00a0an increase of 73% in the same time period. Taken together, this increase in the Garda workforce represents a very\u00a0significant increase in operational policing hours in Drogheda. In addition, these are supported and supplemented by personnel from the Regional Armed Support Unit, Divisional Detective, Drugs and Crime Units as well as\u00a0 Divisional Roads Policing Units as required. Liaison is ongoing with relevant stakeholders, including the Local Authorities, Tusla and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I further note that a key principle arising from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing is that policing is not the responsibility of the police alone, but\u00a0also involves other agencies of Government, such as health or social services, as well as other sectors of society.\u00a0 This principle is at the centre of a new policy on community safety which is being developed in my Department.\u00a0 The policy, which will be given a statutory basis in the new Policing and Community Safety Bill, proposes to establish and support a system of community safety at local level across the country.\u00a0 Through cross-sectoral collaboration, and by drawing on the available services, these\u00a0systems will be best placed to identify, support and implement, community safety according to the needs of the local community.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, officials in my Department are examining how the community in Drogheda can be better supported in the more immediate future including through engagement with the local authority who I know have been very active in delivering on actions to support local communities affected by the increase in violence.\u00a0\u00a0If it would be of assistance, officials in my Department are available to meet with the Deputy to further discuss the situation in Drogheda and the possible responses and, if you agree, I can have that meeting arranged.\u00a0The further advancement of the specific commitment referred to by the Deputy is a matter for the next Government.<\/p>  <p>  Finally I can reassure the Deputy that\u00a0my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keep all criminal legislation under continuous review and that unprecedented resources are being provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help them address the challenge of gangland activities and other forms of criminality in the State - the Garda budget for 2020 amounts to &euro;1.88 billion.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000128#WRCC03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1154,"content":"<p>Question No. 421 answered with Question No. 408.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000128#WRCC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1156,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[6339\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000128#WRCC03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the nationalities which refused to give details of the locations they would quarantine for the 14 day period as reported recently at airports here.","asker":"1569","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1157,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that Border Management Unit Immigration Officers at Dublin Airport, on behalf of the Health Authorities,\u00a0commenced recording Passenger Locator Forms on 28 April 2020.<\/p><p>The\u00a0table below\u00a0provides the\u00a0nationalities of individuals who refused to complete a Passenger Locator Form when entering the State at Dublin Airport between 30 April 2020 and 13 May 2020.<\/p><p>Between 30 April 2020 and 13 May 2020, a total of 55 passengers refused to complete the form, 20 of whom were in transit to locations outside the State.

Instead, the centre chefs are preparing the specialist meals for residents to the best of their ability and using Halal meats. Special dates and drinks, herbs and spices, which are traditional during Ramadan, are also provided on a weekly basis to residents. \u00a0<\/p><p>-All medical prescriptions are being delivered to the centre by local Community Garda&iacute;.\u00a0<\/p><p>-The playground is currently\u00a0closed in order to adhere to\u00a0social and physical distancing requirements. \u00a0<\/p><p>More generally, residents in all centres have been made aware of the need to practice social and physical distancing and good hand hygiene and coughing\/sneezing etiquette. Translations of public health advice have been provided to centres. During this time, centres have been asked to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser is in place for all centres and this is distributed as needed. Other PPE is also distributed as needed and in line with HPSC guidelines on its appropriate use in residential settings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000129#WRDD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1207,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000129#WRDD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1208,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[6064\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000129#WRDD03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a reply will issue to an organisation (details supplied) regarding the refusal of a scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1209,"content":"<p>All applications for funding under the 2019 European Social Fund (&ldquo;ESF&rdquo;) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (&ldquo;PEIL&rdquo;) Gender Equality Call for Proposals are subject to a rigorous assessment and moderation process by the Department of Justice and Equality.

We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.<\/p><p>All accommodation centres, including Ciuin House, are carefully\u00a0following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website\u00a0<i>www.hpsc.ie<\/i>. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. <\/p><p>The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.<\/p><p>The established procedure across all Centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. <\/p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.\u00a0 <\/p><p>We have\u00a0relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.\u00a0 <\/p><p>All residents aged 65 or older and those advised to the Department as having a\u00a0serious medical illness have\u00a0been cocooned due to their particular vulnerability to this virus.\u00a0 <\/p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website <i>www.accommodationcentres.ie<\/i>. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing\/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.<\/p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. <\/p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my\u00a0Department\u00a0has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used\u00a0to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.<\/p><p>Generally, residents of Centres are subject to the same current public health measures as the rest of the population, for example, the right to exercise within a 5km radius, attend medical appointments or to shop for food or other necessities as set out in Government guidelines. However, as with everyone else, where a public health issue arises, Public Health officials may advise that residents stay in their centre and restrict movement for a time while they monitor the situation. <\/p><p>Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision accommodation are eligible to apply for accommodation under the HSE&rsquo;s Temporary Accommodation Scheme announced on 10 April 2020.\u00a0 We are actively encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have provided information, forms and guidance. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.<\/p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department takes any complaints from residents very seriously and all residents are made fully aware of their ability to contact the Department at any time in confidence. If a complaint is not resolved to the satisfaction of the resident, they can\u00a0also avail of the services of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children, as appropriate. If the\u00a0Deputy wishes to raise any specific\u00a0concerns regarding this particular\u00a0centre with me, I would be happy to have my officials follow up.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the Deputy can be assured that my Department\u00a0will continue to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000129#WRDD05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19

together.<\/p><p>I want to assure the Deputy that I, Minister Flanagan and our officials take the safety and wellbeing of all international protection applicants and the community in which they reside extremely seriously.  That has always been our priority.<\/p><p>I do appreciate that the circumstances in which the Skellig Accommodation Centre was opened did not allow for full engagement with local representatives, communities and services; to inform and reassure them and to answer their questions. That is certainly something that I, Minister Flanagan and our officials regret. But, during a public health emergency the decision to move people to a dedicated accommodation centre was seen as an appropriate positive response. <\/p><p>All centres are following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at its website <i>www.hpsc.ie<\/i>.  That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic. My Department is working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.<\/p><p>At the very outset of the crisis, my Department discussed with the HSE the fact that we were accommodating some people in commercial hotels that the Department did not have exclusive use of. This was seen as higher risk at that time in the early stages of the pandemic.<\/p><p>For that reason, we needed to move people to dedicated accommodation centres where they could receive the full set of State supports and services. To do this, we needed to open more accommodation. The Skellig Star hotel in Cahersiveen had been offered to us and was available for immediate occupancy.<\/p><p>We also opened new centres in Rosslare Harbour and Tullamore and temporary accommodation in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.<\/p><p>In total, 600 people were relocated to support social and physical distancing including just over 100 people to the new centre in Cahersiveen.<\/p><p>The residents arrived in Caherciveen on March 18th and 19th.  Some of them did come from a hotel in Dublin at which a case of COVID-19 was subsequently confirmed in an unrelated guest.  My Department was not told of that confirmed case until it was brought to Minister Flanagan&rsquo;s attention by Deputy Catherine Murphy on 6 April 2020.<\/p><p>From subsequent discussions with management at the hotel, our understanding is that the guest involved had only stayed at the hotel for one night in early March when they fell ill. The guest was removed to hospital and their close contacts were asked by the HSE to self-isolate for 14 days as is the norm. No one that we were accommodating in the hotel was approached as a traced contact, and there was no indication whatsoever that anyone we relocated from that hotel was in any way unwell, was awaiting a test or a test result.  In fact, it was well over a fortnight after they arrived before any of our residents in Cahersiveen began to show symptoms and were confirmed as positive for COVID 19.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, medical information such as testing, test results and the release of data relating to same are matters for the HSE in a public health context. We can confirm that, in line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone who has tested positive has been moved to a dedicated self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. Everyone else in the centre was asked to self-isolate while the HSE continued to monitor the situation. Thankfully, the HSE has confirmed that that period of self-isolation has ended today (20 May 2020) and all residents are now subject to the same restrictions as anyone else under Phase 1 of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap.  <\/p><p>There are currently 69 residents (including 9 children) onsite in the centre, which has capacity for 150 residents, and 56 bedrooms. Residents are a mix of single people and small sized families. All single residents have been offered their own bedroom and all bedrooms in the centre are en suite. Some residents have declined this offer and have indicated that they wish to self-isolate with their roommate as a family unit. We continue to encourage these residents to accept the offer of their own room at this time.<\/p><p>Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. This is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff.<\/p><p>My Department is working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There is a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the Centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents.  This person is supported by a wider healthcare team.  Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, exercise equipment has been set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. This outdoor equipment has been installed with the knowledge and support of HSE public health, and will be operated under their direction for safe use.<\/p><p>The residents are currently provided with three meals and snacks daily. However, in line with the overall policy objectives for accommodation centres, the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, the chefs in the centre are working with the residents to find out about preferred meals and staff have been asked to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms. The centre has a good Wi-Fi service and phone credit has also been provided for residents so that they can keep in touch with family and friends.<\/p><p>The current restrictions are especially difficult for children. In addition to the upgrades to the outdoor space, toys, puzzles and tablets have been being provided for children and laptops have also been provided for residents&rsquo; use. The Tusla official seconded to work with my Department has contacted the families to see what additional supports they need and to discuss any concerns they might have.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department began virtual clinics with residents earlier this week and a telephone support service for residents is also being established with the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS).<\/p><p>The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to work with accommodation centre management, health agencies and NGOs to provide every support possible to residents at this unprecedented and difficult time for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000130#WRGG02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licences","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000130#WRGG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[6446\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000130#WRGG04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding licences for public houses to be extended that are due to expire in August 2020 in view of the fact that they have been closed for a considerable period of time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>The position is that the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 contain statutory provisions for the issue and renewal by the Revenue Commissioners of excise licences for the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor in premises to which on-licences are attached, such as public houses, restaurants, and theatres, as well as those premises to which off licences are attached, such as specialist off licences and mixed trading premises.

Since enactment of that legislation, an applicant does not have to apply to the annual licensing District Court for a certificate as to their good character and the peaceable and orderly manner in which the premises have been operated. Where premises have been licensed in the immediately preceding year, licences may, on application prior to expiry of the existing licence, be renewed by the Revenue Commissioners without production of any such court certificate unless an objection to such renewal has been lodged in the District Court.

They aim to support young people to develop and mature through positive interventions and interactions with a local project.\u00a0 GYDPs provide a range of education and training programmes e.g. academic support, IT, employment preparation and specific job training.\u00a0<\/p><p>Since 2015, GYDPs have been co-funded under the Programme for Employability Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) of the European Social Fund (ESF) 2014-2020.<\/p><p>My Department is pursuing an ambitious programme for the future development of GYDP services, working closely with community organisations and with expert support from the Research Evidence into Policy Programmes and Practice project in the University of Limerick. <\/p><p>The funding provided for Garda Youth Diversion Projects in the years 2018 to date is\u00a0set out in the following table.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Amount<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;13.7m (expenditure)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>&euro;15.8m (expenditure)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>&euro;18.3m (allocation)<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> The Deputy may also\u00a0wish to be aware that the\u00a0draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026 has recently been published for\u00a0public consultation\u00a0by my colleague the Minister for State David Stanton.\u00a0 An online questionnaire is available until the\u00a0end of\u00a0June to allow members of the public, including of course\u00a0young people, to express their views.\u00a0 Further information is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000131#WRHH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dublin Airport Authority","counter":1287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000131#WRHH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1288,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[6530\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000131#WRHH01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he engaged in or received correspondence with the management team at Dublin Airport or the Dublin Airport board of directors in relation to flights from northern Italy from January 2020 to date; if so, the nature of the correspondence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1504","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1289,"content":"<p>My Department has no record of any engagement or correspondence with either the management team at Dublin Airport or the Dublin Airport board of directors in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that in the interest of public health, the Government is requesting that operators of aircraft ensure that all persons entering the state are aware of the requirement to complete an Irish public health passenger locator form on arrival into Ireland.

We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate. <\/p><p>All accommodation centres are carefully\u00a0following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which can be found on its website\u00a0<i>www.hpsc.ie<\/i>. That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. <\/p><p>The direction from the HSE is that during the COVID crisis non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.<\/p><p>The established procedure across all Centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. My Department has opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities for residents in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and Dundalk, with a total capacity of 299 rooms. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. <\/p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Caherciveen and Tullamore.\u00a0 <\/p><p>We have\u00a0relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any of our centres. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over.\u00a0 <\/p><p>All residents aged 65 or older and those advised to the Department as having a\u00a0serious medical illness have\u00a0been cocooned due to their particular vulnerability to this virus.\u00a0 <\/p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website <i>www.accommodationcentres.ie<\/i>. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing\/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.<\/p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as required. Other PPE is distributed, as needed, and in line with the HPSC guidelines for its appropriate use in residential settings. <\/p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, my\u00a0Department\u00a0has put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. It is also being used\u00a0to advise, support and work with locations where vulnerable groups are present relating to the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.<\/p><p>Generally, residents of Centres are subject to the same current public health measures as the rest of the population, for example, the right to exercise within a 5km radius, attend medical appointments or to shop for food or other necessities as set out in Government guidelines. However, as with everyone else, where a public health issue arises, Public Health officials may advise that residents stay in their centre and restrict movement for a time while they monitor the situation. <\/p><p>Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision accommodation are eligible to apply for accommodation under the HSE&rsquo;s Temporary Accommodation Scheme announced on 10 April 2020.\u00a0 We are actively encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have provided information, forms and guidance. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.<\/p><p>We will continue to work closely with the HSE and centre management during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000131#WRHH02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1515"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service","counter":1299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000131#WRHH02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1300,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[6668\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000131#WRHH02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a further extension on all emigration permissions will be issued from 20 May 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1301,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that in light of the current uncertainties caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, I have\u00a0announced that immigration permissions, due to expire between 20 May 2020 and 20 July 2020,\u00a0have been\u00a0automatically extended for two months.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>This includes people in Ireland on short stay visas and those whose permissions have already been extended by the previous notice, which extended permissions between 20 March 2020\u00a0and 20 May 2020.

Covid-19 in a prison setting would present significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners, and the provision of appropriate medical treatment to affected persons and the maintenance of staffing levels.<\/p><p>A significant amount of work has been carried out by the Irish Prison Service to address this challenge, informed and guided by the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Council of Europe. <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, in March this year, I approved a number of actions to assist the Irish Prison Service to reduce the numbers of prisoners in custody, including the temporary release of low-risk prisoners, in order to ensure effective infection control measure were possible. <\/p><p>In the first instance, the approach adopted included granting temporary release to low risk prisoners who were serving sentences of less than 12 months for non-violent offences. Subsequently, prisoners assessed as low risk who had less than 6 months to serve were also granted temporary release from some prisons depending on the risks present.<\/p><p>I am informed that all prisoners granted temporary release were assessed on a case-by-case basis.  The primary factor in the consideration of any prisoner for early release remains public safety and risks assessed included any convictions for domestic abuse, such as breach of barring orders which present significant risks at the present time. I am informed that, on 19 May 2020 there were 752 prisoners in custody with less than 6 months remaining on their sentence. It is important to note, however, that many of these prisoners will not be eligible for temporary release due to the nature of their offence, the risk to public safety or further charges pending which remand them to custody beyond the expiration of their current sentence.<\/p><p>As a result of the measures taken, I am informed that an initial 470 prisoners were granted temporary release and that, since then, further periods of temporary release have been granted resulting in a total of over 600 prisoners receiving temporary release, including community return, since the outset of this pandemic. As the Deputy will appreciate, the size of the prison population changes on a daily basis, as new committals and remands are made by the courts and releases occur as prisoners reach the end of their sentences. However, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that, due to the granting of temporary release and a reduced number of committals from the Courts, the prison population has reduced from 4,235 on 11 March 2020 to 3,763 on 20 May 2020. This represents a reduction of 472 or just over 11% over this period.<\/p><p>I am informed that the following table sets out the prison population and the number of prisoners on temporary release for dates within the period in 2019 and 2020 referred to by the Deputy.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Date<\/th>       <th>Total Prison Population <\/th>       <th>Number on Temporary Release <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11 March 2019<\/td>       <td>3984<\/td>       <td>217<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>20 May 2019<\/td>       <td>3999<\/td>       <td>243<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11 March 2020<\/td>       <td>4235<\/td>       <td>343<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>20 May 2020<\/td>       <td>3763<\/td>       <td>427<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> As the Deputy will appreciate, given the current number of prisoners in custody, the Irish Prison Service is not in a position to provide single cell accommodation to all prisoners. I am informed that single-cell occupancy across the system would result in a bed capacity of less than 3,000 and would not be possible to achieve without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered to represent a threat to public safety. I am further informed that, in some cases, prisoners are housed together for reasons other than lack of capacity. I understand that family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell. I am further informed that shared cell accommodation can in certain cases be very beneficial from a management point of view, particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm, and that there will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.<\/p><p>I am informed that information regarding in-cell occupancy is collated by the Irish Prison Service on a quarterly basis. The data for the April Census is currently being finalised for publication.

In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.<\/p><p>The established procedure across all Centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre.

This is an essential step in the process.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An applicant's good character is assessed in a number of ways; including but not limited to: <\/p>  <p>  - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetting; <\/p>  <p>  - Home Country Police clearance; and\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Adherence to the laws and regulations of the State, including regarding revenue matters. social welfare matters and in relation to driving offences. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that everyone&rsquo;s case is different, for example, many applicants provide dog licences as an indication as to their adherence to the laws of the land, whereas others provide fishing licences and permits. An increasing number of applicants provide tax clearance certificates. In fact, my Department officials and the Revenue Commissioners have collaborated on making this process easier by the provision of a Citizenship e-tax clearance selection within the drop down list on the Revenue website. \u00a0Accordingly, the good character assessment cannot be captured in a prescriptive list, rather the entirety of the case will be assessed on its own merits.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Other applicants, in addition to providing evidence of their adherence to the rules of the State, go further and provide evidence as to their active contribution to their communities. This can take many forms including letters from members of their communities relating to their involvement in their communities, e.g. volunteering on schools committees, local development committees, fund raising, volunteering in charities, faith communities, sports and social organisations, etc. These acts of active Citizenship are to be commended. However, my officials\u00a0fully understand\u00a0that everyone&rsquo;s circumstances are different and applicants may not be in a position to be active in their communities for various reasons. <\/p>  <p>  I&rsquo;m sure the Deputy would agree that the rich tapestry of\u00a0a person's\u00a0interactions with the State and their involvement in community life is unique to the individual\u00a0and is not something that lends itself to a rigidly prescriptive list. <\/p>  <p>  As\u00a0the Deputy\u00a0may be aware, the next scheduled citizenship ceremony due to take place in the INEC in Killarney in July 2020 has unfortunately been postponed due to the current restrictions. I have instructed my officials to examine feasible mechanisms and processes whereby procedures such as citizenship ceremonies can take place while fully complying with the criteria outlined in the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the\u00a0Deputy may be aware of a challenge taken in the High Court last year by an applicant who was refused a certificate of naturalisation due to his\u00a0absences from the State during the last year continuous prior to the date of his application. The outcome of this ruling &ndash; which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal &ndash; resulted in significant delays to the processing of naturalisation applications last year.<\/p>  <p>  The restrictions attendant to the current COVID-19 pandemic have regrettably resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services. As a result of these restrictions, the \u00a0 Citizenship Division of Immigration Service Delivery, along with many other public and private sector organisations is experiencing significant disruption in delivering its core functions. Working\u00a0within\u00a0these restrictions,\u00a0public safety and the wellbeing of staff are of course both urgent priorities.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy\u00a0that the matter is receiving\u00a0ongoing attention and\u00a0as soon as a practical plan is in place for the re-commencement of normal service delivery, notifications will be placed on our website (www.inis.gov.ie). \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000132#WRJJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1589"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision System","counter":1361,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000132#WRJJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1362,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[6994\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000132#WRJJ01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when State owned direct provision centres will be converted to independent living centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1589"},{"type":"speech","counter":1363,"content":"<p>I can\u00a0inform the Deputy that the Office of Public Works (OPW)\u00a0is\u00a0responsible for all maintenance and improvement works in the seven State-owned accommodation centres for persons seeking International Protection.

The study examined the implications of Brexit for the Irish economy and trade, quantifying the impact of possible new barriers to trade which might emerge as a result of Brexit. <\/p><p>The study also provided analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy. Five sectors were identified that account for 90% of the impact and these are: Agri-food, Pharma-chemicals, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail, and Air Transport. The rise of non-tariff barriers due to regulatory divergence is the main factor driving the results as opposed to the imposition of the tariff regimes of the EU and the UK on their respective imports\/goods.<\/p><p>This analysis was undertaken on the basis of no policy action being taken although this of course is not the case given the extensive Brexit mitigation actions put in place across Government and across all sectors of the economy in the past few years.\u00a0<\/p><p>All of the scenarios examined in the 2018 study produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario. The scenarios considered reflected four of the possible outcomes from the future relationship between the EU and the UK &ndash; an EEA scenario, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a Customs Union, or a worst-case, no trade deal, WTO scenario. <\/p><p>The WTO scenario was found to have the most negative impact on the Irish economy gradually reducing GDP growth by 7% by 2030; an EEA scenario would be least damaging gradually reducing GDP growth by 2.8% by 2030. The study found that regardless of the scenario modelled, the Irish economy was still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030. Brexit would have a dampening impact, however, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. <\/p><p>Following the adoption of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Revised Political Declaration (RPD) on the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK last year, my Department undertook further Brexit analysis with Copenhagen Economics. Under this latest study, two additional scenarios for a Free Trade Agreement were examined to take account of the provisions of the RPD published in January 2020. This latest study is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Overall, the findings from this study suggest that a Brexit outcome based on the RPD is likely to reduce Irish GDP by between 3.2% and 3.9% by 2030 compared with a baseline where the UK remains a member of the EU. This compares to a negative impact of 7%\u00a0in the no deal (WTO basis)\u00a0modelled in the previous Copenhagen Economics study.<\/p><p>In response to the various Brexit analysis and studies undertaken across Government I have, over the course of the last three budgets put in place through the enterprise agencies, an extensive suite of enterprise supports to assist businesses to meet the challenges presented by Brexit. They range from liquidity support through short-term and long-term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties. The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies.<\/p><p>Of course most recently businesses have been beset by the huge challenges that COVID-19 has brought about. Government has responded swiftly by making available a myriad of supports to help businesses deal with the crisis presented by this pandemic. <\/p><p>As we begin the phased reopening of the economy this week in line with the Government's COVID-19 recovery plan, I am acutely aware too that businesses must not lose sight of the Brexit-related challenges that remain. This is particularly highlighted by the challenging negotiations that are currently ongoing between the EU and the UK to reach an agreement on the future trading relationship, and the ever-present danger of a no trade deal scenario. <\/p><p>As our economy recovers post the Covid-19 pandemic, I encourage businesses more than ever to avail of the Government supports that are widely available.

I am keenly aware that some businesses, particularly in the retail sector, are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.<\/p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank\/lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18 March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30 April last.<\/p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.<\/p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.<\/p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants. <\/p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I have just received a response in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed.

I would like to point out that, on 2 May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:<\/p><p>-A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver\/rebate from 2019;<\/p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;<\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates; <\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and<\/p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.<\/p><p>These supports acknowledge that impacted businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.<\/p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at <i>www.gov.ie<\/i>or on my Department&rsquo;s website\u00a0(<i><\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000133#WRKK02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000133#WRKK02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1449,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[5638\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000133#WRKK02500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will amend the Covid-19 retail online scheme to offer more support to those that do not have a pre-existing online presence; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that just 69% of small and medium-sized enterprises here have a website and that only 32% of these online companies sell products or services online; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1450,"content":"<p>As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I am acutely aware that Covid-19 has brought particular challenges for retailers - large and small, across the country.<\/p><p>Trading online is a very important route for retail businesses to grow and improve their business in the current crisis, and will be an important element in their recovery over the longer term. In April of this year I increased support for two online trading initiatives to a total of &euro;7.6m &ndash; the first for micro enterprises in partnership with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Richard Bruton TD, and the second for retailers with 10 or more employees.<\/p><p>Firstly, in conjunction with Minister Bruton's Department of Climate Action and the Environment,\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0increased support for the Trading Online Voucher Scheme which is available to all micro enterprises with less than 10 employees, including those in the retail sector through the Local Enterprise Office network nationwide. The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Vouchers are a key government grant to help small and micro enterprises, with very limited or no e-commerce presence, to\u00a0get online, boost their sales and reach new markets &ndash; particularly during this difficult period,\u00a0when so many small businesses are closed to the public. However, the value of the Trading Online Voucher will stand to businesses for years to come, boosting revenue, and helping sustain and create jobs into the future. <\/p><p>The Voucher\u00a0can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to websites or developing new apps for customers, with co-funding from the business currently set at just 10 percent. The Voucher can also be used towards subscriptions to low-cost online retail platform solutions to help companies quickly establish a retailing presence online. Training and further business supports are also provided along with the Scheme.<\/p><p>Flexibilities to the Trading Online Voucher scheme\u00a0 are now in place allowing businesses apply for a second voucher where they have successfully utilised their first one, which brings the overall total voucher amount available up to &euro;5,000 for each eligible business.\u00a0 <\/p><p>To qualify for the scheme, businesses must have:<\/p><p>- limited or no e-commerce presence<\/p><p>- no more than 10 employees;<\/p><p>- less than &euro;2m in turnover; <\/p><p>- be trading for at least 6 months and <\/p><p>- be located in the region of the local enterprise office to whom they are applying (additional T&amp;amp;Cs apply)<\/p><p>Further details about the expanding Trading Online Voucher Scheme are available at <i><\/i><\/p><p>The Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme is complementary to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) Trading Online Voucher Scheme.

Applicant companies must employ 10 or more people, have an existing online presence (e.g. website or social media), and have a retail outlet through which they derive the majority of their revenue. Successful applicants will be awarded funding to support a maximum of 80% of the project costs. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. <\/p><p>This Scheme is not about taking the first steps; it is about raising the bar, in an informed, planned and strategic way.\u00a0 The total fund size will be up to &euro;2 million under this call.

The Health and Safety Authority will ensure compliance with the Protocol through a range of measures including advice, guidance, inspection and enforcement action as appropriate under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  The Protocol provides that within the workplace every employer will prepare a COVID-19 specific Response Plan and appoint at least one\u00a0lead COVID-19\u00a0worker representative. The Protocol also provides that\u00a0this Plan will be developed in consultation with workers.\u00a0Existing safety representatives in the workplace appointed under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, can play a valuable role in this regard. I\u00a0am satisfied that this\u00a0approach will\u00a0ensure the necessary collaboration and co-operation between employers and employees who share the common goal of keeping workplaces safe.<\/p>  <p>  Phase 1 of the reopening of the economy began on Monday last and, as I said at the time, the HSA and other inspectors are out there advising and guiding employers on how to respect the Protocol.\u00a0 Helping businesses to comply is the overall goal of the HSA.\u00a0 However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers.

The Restart Grant will be available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m and employing 50 people or less, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% reduction in turnover out to 30<sup>th<\/sup>June 2020. It is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grants will be equivalent to the rates bill of the business in 2019, with a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and a maximum payment of &euro;10,000. <\/p><p>I recognise the impact that this pandemic is having on businesses right across the country, I know that employers and employees want to get back to work and I support them in that ambition, but it must be safe to do so.\u00a0 My Department contributed to the considerations around the phased re-opening of sectors and I will work within Government to secure further details and clarity for businesses as we progress through the phases outlined in the Roadmap.<\/p><p>A wide range of stakeholders including employers, unions and representative groups were consulted and their advice formed part of the considerations when drawing up the Roadmap. It is a living document and Government has the ability to flex the plans depending on the circumstances existing as we progress through each phase.

While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs.<\/p>  <p>  As we have seen with the general public health measures that we have all been asked to observe, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings. I am expecting employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol, for the health and safety of all concerned. The HSA inspectors cannot be expected to go into every business in the country. That would be entirely unrealistic and unachievable. What they will do is a mix of unannounced inspections, along with providing advice and information through the HSA Workplace Contact Unit email and phoneline. If, following contact from a worker, and engagement with the employer, they feel that an inspection is warranted, they will follow up with an on-site visit. However if, following an inspection, the inspector forms the opinion that further action is required, the appropriate action, up to and including the closure of a workplace, will be taken using the relevant powers.

Free mentoring and online training are also available for all SMEs. This package is a significant step-up in the supports available for all businesses in all sectors at this very difficult time. The measures have been developed to meet the varying needs of Irish enterprise and they are very specifically targeted by size, sector and need.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the new package of liquidity measures I announced are detailed below, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In that regard, Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.<\/p>  <p>  The key measures which constitute the &euro;1 billion in liquidity measures as I announced are set out below. <\/p>  <p>  The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme was announced on 11 March and opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my further announcement on April 8 this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250 million in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450 million.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 4 May, there has been a total of 2,127 applications received to the COVID-19 WCS, of which 1,834 candidates were eligible, 9 ineligible and 284 applications are currently in process. Of those, 156 loans have progressed to sanction to a total value of &euro;28.02m.<\/p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) though participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019 across all sectors and regions including in exporting businesses and family businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 4 May, there has been a total of 3,449 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 3,286 have been approved for eligibility under the scheme. The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. On 8 April, I announced a further expansion of this scheme and my Department is now working through the details of a significant expansion to bring this funding to market as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  A new &euro;2,500 Business Continuity Voucher is available through Local Enterprise Offices and is designed for businesses across every sector that employ up to 50 people. It\u00a0can be used by companies to develop short-term and long-term strategies to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the &euro;150m of funding capacity in the Government&rsquo;s Credit Guarantee Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  For microenterprises (under 10 employees) and businesses with over 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland (MFI) are administering special COVID-19 Loans, with an additional &euro;13m in capital support bringing its total lending capacity up to &euro;20m for the coming period. There is also a substantial reduction in interest rates on these loans from 7.8% to 4.5%. Loans can be made up to &euro;50,000 with no repayments required and no interest charged in the first six months.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme for microenterprises is being expanded - an additional &euro;3.3m is being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;180m Sustaining Enterprise Fund is specifically aimed at all firms with 10 or more employees in the manufacturing and international services sectors impacted by COVID-19 that are vulnerable but viable. The Fund will be operated by Enterprise Ireland, providing repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 as agreed with the EU under new State Aid rules and, together with leveraged lending from the financial markets, should see up to &euro;500m of additional investment in vulnerable but viable firms. These grants will only be repayable if and when a business returns to financial good health.<\/p>  <p>  A Business Financial Planning Grant from Enterprise Ireland to the value of &euro;5,000 to assist companies to develop a Business Sustainment Plan and to engage the services of an approved Financial Consultant.<\/p>  <p>  A new &euro;2,500 LEAN Business Improvement Grant from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to help companies quickly access expertise to review and optimise operations at a time of crisis and identify the key measures needed to ensure continued viability.<\/p>  <p>  A new &euro;2m Online Retail Scheme from Enterprise Ireland will be open to retailers employing over 10 people. The objective of the Scheme is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0On Saturday 2 May last, I also announced a further suite of measures to support small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by Covid-19 with Minister Paschal Donohoe, T.D., Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and Minister Eoghan Murphy, T.D.,\u00a0 Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. This package of support followed the publication of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business, which sets out a five-stage plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions and reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy and society. The new measures we announced included:<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates\/waiver rebate from 2019;<\/p>  <p>  - A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;<\/p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt; and,<\/p>  <p>  - A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Shane Ross T.D., Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport may be able to provide more specific guidelines or supports designed to suit private bus operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":1589,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1590,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[6025\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will meet with representatives of cinema operators to ensure that reopening of cinemas occurs at the right time and with the right procedures.","asker":"1451","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1591,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out five stages for unlocking the restrictions put in place to contain the Coronavirus, at three week intervals.

I am keenly aware that some businesses, particularly in the retail sector, are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.<\/p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank \/ lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18<sup>th<\/sup>March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30<sup>th<\/sup>April last.<\/p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.<\/p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.<\/p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants. <\/p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I have just received a response in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. The difficulties stem from a variety of legal bases including statutory, constitutional, contract and common law. I have asked my officials to consider the advice.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. I would like to point out that, on 2<sup>nd<\/sup>May, the Government announced an additional suite of measures to further support small, medium and larger business that have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. These included:<\/p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver\/rebate from 2019;<\/p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;<\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates; - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; and<\/p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.<\/p><p>These supports acknowledge that impacted businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.<\/p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at <i>www.gov.ie<\/i>or on my Department&rsquo;s website\u00a0(<i><\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Workplace Safety","counter":1608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1609,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[6133\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM03600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of staff in both the HSA and HSE attributed to deal with businesses that fail to adhere to Covid-19 guidelines.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1610,"qnumday":623,"qnumall":"[6561\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM03700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the requirements including the specific legal requirements that employers will have to meet under the National Return to Work Safely Protocol; the expected number of workplace inspectors that will be needed for implementation of this protocol; the number of inspectors employed by the Health and Safety Authority; the additional number that will be taken on for the remainder of the Covid-19 period; and the estimated cost of additional staff resources.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1611,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 623 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I launched the national &ldquo;Return to Work Safely Protocol&rdquo; Saturday, 9 May 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Protocol was drafted in close consultation with the social partners under the auspices of the Labour and Employer Economic Forum and agreed with them.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, the HSA has full powers to oversee compliance with the health, safety and wellbeing of workers in their place of work.  While COVID-19 is a public health issue, the infectious nature of the virus and the way in which it is easily transmitted through human contact, makes it a workplace health and safety issue as well as a general health matter.  Neither health, safety nor welfare are narrowly defined in the 2005 Act, so the HSA has all of the powers that it needs.<\/p>  <p>  The HSA is deploying all its available inspectors across sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol.  The HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace\/business inspection responsibilities.  As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules. We can expect the same from employers and workers, most of who want to get back to work, and want the workplace to be safe, for them and for the families that they are returning to in the evenings.<\/p>  <p>  I am expecting employers and workers, in line with what is set out in the Protocol, to actively and jointly take responsibility for applying the clear measures set out in the Protocol, for the health and safety of all concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Even with the enhanced cohort of inspectors available to the HSA, they cannot be expected to go into every business in the country.

Included in the updates were measures to increase the wage subsidy for certain lower paid employees.\u00a0 In effect, for those employees with previous net pay of less than &euro;586 per week, the amount of the temporary wage subsidy shall not exceed &euro;410 per week in accordance with the following principles:<\/p><p>- an 85% subsidy shall be payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly pay does not exceed &euro;412; and <\/p><p>- a flat rate subsidy of up to &euro;350 shall be payable in the case of employees whose average net weekly pay is more than &euro;412 but not more than &euro;500.<\/p><p>In addition, where an employer wishes to pay a greater level of top-up, in respect of employees with net pay of less than &euro;412 per week, in order to bring the employee&rsquo;s pay to &euro;350 per week, then tapering would not be applied to the subsidy.<\/p><p>These changes to the TWSS mean that more employees will now receive a subsidy of &euro;350 per week, and those with previous net pay below &euro;412 per week will now receive a greater level of subsidy. <\/p><p>These new rates have been fully operational for payroll submissions made on or after 4 May 2020, with a pay date on or after that same date.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The changes announced allow the concentration of resources to protect incomes, in a proportionate way having regard to available resources, employer contribution and the broader suite of COVID-19 related supports put in place by the Government.<\/p><p>Currently, the Minister for Finance has no plans to change the average wage calculation to a different period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":1621,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1622,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[6244\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM04900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if construction works on a new advanced technology unit at Knockaconny, County Monaghan has commenced; the expected duration of such works; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1623,"content":"<p>My Department and the IDA are working hard to attract further investment to County Monaghan, despite the challenges presented by Covid-19. \u00a0As the Deputy is aware, the next phase of the IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP)\u00a0includes\u00a0plans for\u00a0an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU)\u00a0at Knockaconny in the County.<\/p>  <p>  I was\u00a0pleased to\u00a0turn the sod on this building in December, marking the beginning of construction.\u00a0 Whilst the\u00a0project was\u00a0initially scheduled for completion in December 2020, construction has been temporarily put on hold on account of Covid-19.

Corporate Compliance Manager and three Forensic Accountants.<\/p><p>In relation to the post of Corporate Compliance Manager, the current Director is considering this as part of a significant restructuring of the ODCE that he has undertaken to better reflect the organisation&rsquo;s needs in the context of both its strategic shift towards deploying resources towards more serious indications of wrongdoing and the increasingly complex environment within which the ODCE operates. \u00a0<\/p><p>That restructuring has included the seeking of sanction for the recruitment of a substantial number of additional professional staff, and following receipt of sanction, the recruitment of eight accounting professionals (one of whom was promoted to Enforcement Portfolio Manager), two Enforcement Portfolio Managers and a Digital Forensics Specialist, together with significant investment in a digital forensics laboratory, training and development. The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the Corporate Compliance manager vacancy. The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to an independent Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the role, and associated skill set, required of the appointee.<\/p><p>My Office is actively engaging with PAS in relation to filling the Professional Accountant Grade 1 posts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000135#WRMM07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":1646,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000136#WRNN00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1647,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[6349\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000136#WRNN00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of businesses by county which have drawn down Covid-19 loans according to each loan type available in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1596","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1648,"content":"<p>The SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme opened for eligibility applications on 23 March.

Following my announcement on 8 April, this scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250m in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450m.<\/p><p>There has been strong appetite for the scheme such that as of 10 May 2020, there have been a total of 2,118 applications received to the COVID-19 WCS, of which 2,017 candidates were eligible and 13 ineligible. 88 applications are currently in process.

The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS scheme has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. One of the participating financial providers lenders has remaining capacity and businesses seeking loan approval are being directed towards this lender.<\/p><p>On 8 April 2020, I announced that this scheme would be expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Based on data available for the first &euro;93.047 million of loans drawn down under the Future Growth Loan Scheme, 100% of these were by SMEs.

Term loans and other products such stocking facilities, performance bonds will be covered by the Scheme.<\/p><p>The interest rate charged on the loan will be the banks' SME lending rates. In addition, the borrower pays a premium which partially covers the cost of providing the guarantee. The premium can vary but is currently 0.5%.\u00a0 It may be possible to avail of between a three to six-month interest-only payment period, but this depends on the lender&rsquo;s assessment of the application.<\/p><p>An application to access the Credit Guarantee Scheme can be made through one of the participating lenders which are currently Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank Ireland.\u00a0 The Scheme is operated by SBCI, the Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders.

While the HSA has an overall complement of about 100 in the inspectorate grade, between 60 and 70 of these will initially be deployed across sectors to carry out both spot checks and other inspections to check compliance with the Protocol. The HSA inspectorate will be supplemented significantly by deploying, under the authority of the HSA, other inspectors from across the system who already have an environmental health, agriculture or other workplace\/business inspection responsibilities. These will be warranted by me, using powers in the 2005 Act, to carry out COVID-19 inspections under the Protocol, as the economy opens up in line with the Government Roadmap.<\/p>  <p>  As we have seen with the general public health measures over the past two months, most people are complying with the rules.

I am keenly aware that some businesses are concerned that some landlords are continuing to insist on the payment of rents and leases as normal despite their premises being closed.<\/p><p>At the same time, we must remember that landlords have their own financial obligations, like debt repayments, insurance or security costs, that still need to be paid. Where a landlord has debt in place, their flexibility will likely be driven by what their bank \/ lender will accept. The Minister for Finance raised the broader issue of rents in meetings with the pillar banks. He referenced this in his announcement of 18 March concerning an arrangement with the banks to the effect that any landlord who has agreed a deal with the banks on foot of the arrangement will be expected to pass the benefit on to their tenants. I reiterated this in the D&aacute;il on 30 April last.<\/p><p>While commercial leases are primarily a contractual matter for the tenant and the landlord, the Government has urged landlords to demonstrate forbearance in these extraordinary times and to play their part, as everyone must, in helping the country through this difficult period. I would encourage tenants and landlords to engage with each other on this matter and come to some arrangement as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed.<\/p><p>I have asked my officials to raise the matter of commercial rents and leases across a number of Government Departments. An initial inter-departmental discussion has already taken place and I understand further engagement is underway with a range of stakeholders, including groups representing businesses and landlords, to gain additional insights and gather intelligence to inform any further discussions. I have also asked my officials to look into the different responses from other countries and to identify possible options for supports.<\/p><p>While different options are being explored, I would point out that any support to business in respect of rents alone would ultimately end up as a support to the landlord. Not only would it be difficult to estimate the costs involved for such a scheme, but the offering of support, or even the perception that such supports will be forthcoming, may affect the market and lessen the impetus for landlords to renegotiate with tenants.<\/p><p>The matter of legal protections for businesses who are unable to pay their commercial rents has been raised with the Attorney General. Specifically, I asked about the potential for legislation to prevent the eviction of commercial tenants who have failed to pay rent as a result of the pandemic and the possibility of legislating to place a moratorium on businesses having to pay rent for premises they cannot used due to the restrictions imposed by Government. I have just received a response in which the Attorney General advises that there are significant legal difficulties in respect to both of the questions posed. I have asked my officials to consider this advice.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and it will continue to look at how we can support businesses that have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p><p>I would like to point out that the Government has introduced a range of measures aimed at supporting businesses including:<\/p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Scheme supports loans up to &euro;1 million for periods of up to 7 years. Applications can be made to AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. Eligibility criteria apply.<\/p><p>- Microenterprises can access COVID-19 Business Loans of up to &euro;50,000 from Microfinance Ireland. The terms include a six months interest free and repayment free moratorium, with the loan to then be repaid over the remaining 30 months of the 36-month loan period. Businesses can apply through their Local Enterprise Office or directly online at www.microfinanceireland.ie.\u00a0<\/p><p>- The new &euro;450m SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme for eligible businesses supports loans from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5 million (first &euro;500,000 unsecured). Applications can be made through the SBCI website at www.sbci.gov.ie.\u00a0 <\/p><p>- An additional &euro;200 million in COVID-19 funding for the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which will be released in tranches, will provide longer-term loans to COVID-19 impacted businesses.<\/p><p>- The new Sustaining Enterprise Fund of up to &euro;180 million is specifically aimed at firms with 10 or more employees impacted by COVID-19 that are vulnerable but viable. The fund is operated by Enterprise Ireland, providing repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 as agreed with the EU under new State Aid rules.<\/p><p>On 2 May, a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted were introduced. These included:<\/p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver\/rebate from 2019 (see below for more information);<\/p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;<\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;<\/p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;<\/p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt;<\/p><p>- A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public.<\/p><p>These supports acknowledge that impacted businesses need time and space to restructure and resume activity, without the added pressures of trying to repay legacy debts, such as commercial rents, when revenues are just beginning to return.<\/p><p>On Friday 15th May last, the Government agreed the arrangements for the new &euro;250m &ldquo;Restart Grant&rdquo; for micro enterprises and small businesses.\u00a0 The Restart Grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. Eligible businesses will receive a Restart Grant equivalent to their commercial rates assessment for 2019 (excluding arrears), subject to a minimum grant of &euro;2,000 and a maximum of &euro;10,000.<\/p><p>This grant will provide funding to enable small and micro business reconnect with their employees and customer base by helping to defray ongoing fixed costs and the costs, such as PPE, associated with re-launching the business.<\/p><p>Further information on all of these and additional Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses can be found at www.gov.ie or on my Department&rsquo;s website ().<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000137#WROO06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1777,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[7021\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000137#WROO07000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her plans to provide supports for the live entertainment industry (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1778,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, policy responsibility for the arts rests with my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Josepha Madigan TD.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for COVID-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan in Response to Covid-19 and the recommendation of NPHET. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the expert advice, delivery of essential non-Covid care has continued to date, although at significantly lower volumes than previously. In particular, the delivery of cancer care, urgent surgery and trauma services are areas in which care continues to be delivered, often in alternative locations and using innovative methods of care delivery. Where possible, hospitals are working to provide services in a different way, which includes virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. Cancer services are continuing with prioritisation of time-sensitive treatment, and the ongoing review of the location of the delivery of cancer services. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0NPHET has now recommended that steps be taken to resume non-urgent scheduled care in the context of the safe care guidelines set out by its Expert Advisory Group. Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-covid care, for patients and healthcare workers, and support safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the Expert Advisory Subgroup of NPHET (EAG) and approved in principle by NPHET. This guidance includes, for example, guidance on screening, swabbing and use of PPE. <\/p>  <p>  In collaboration with my Department&rsquo;s communications team, research to understand why some people are avoiding interacting with health services has been initiated. Findings from a survey and focus groups commissioned by the Department indicate that fear of infection is one of the primary factors influencing peoples' reluctance in attending for acute services.\u00a0 This data has informed the development of an advertisement campaign reassuring the public that GP services and EDs are available and open for business, with changes made to accommodate patients safely in the context of Covid-19. The campaign commenced on Monday 11th May, through national and local radio and social media, supported by local spokespeople and will be revised or concluded in line with impact seen on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of understanding the impact of COVID-19 on waiting lists, the HSE and my Department are actively working to build methodologies for gathering relevant data to try to facilitate not only a better understanding of the health system at this time, but to try to model growing service demands as the year progresses and as the health system continues to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  The Outpatient waiting list at the end of April shows an increase of 5,636 in comparison to the end of March. The figure for those waiting less than 3 months has fallen by 24,076 in the same period, a reflection of the decrease in referrals by GPs. Meanwhile, the number of patients awaiting an Inpatient or Day Case (IPDC) procedure increased by 8,595 at the end of April when compared to the end of March waiting list.\u00a0 During the same period the number on the &lsquo;To Come In&rsquo; (TCI) list (those with an appointment for a procedure in the next six weeks) has reduced by 5,427.\u00a0 Accordingly, a large part of the increase in the IPDC waiting list relates to patients moving back to the Active waiting list from the TCI list.\u00a0 While the IPDC waiting list figure at the end of April is indicative of fewer patients being treated, it is of note that there were also fewer patients seen in Outpatient clinics in the same period and as a consequence fewer patients were referred for procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000140#WRRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":1976,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000140#WRRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1977,"qnumday":717,"qnumall":"[6038\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000140#WRRR04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of phone calls made to the HSE drug and alcohol helpline between 1 February and 1 May 2020; the number made to the helpline between the same dates in 2018 and 2019, respectively; the number of the daily positive Covid-19 cases which are persons with hospital-acquired Covid-19; and the number of such persons that have lost their lives.","asker":"1504","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1978,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000140#WRRR04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme","counter":1979,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000140#WRRR04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1980,"qnumday":718,"qnumall":"[6043\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000140#WRRR04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if organ transplant patients are excluded from receiving medications under the long term illness scheme and the drugs payment scheme; and if so, if transplant patients that require life-saving drugs for the rest of their lives will be made eligible to receive their medication under these schemes.","asker":"1555","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1981,"content":"<p>The Long Term Illness Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). <\/p>  <p>  The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.

In addition, a significant increase in the number of cases in Ireland as a result of importation could have an impact on public compliance with public health guidance and restrictions. Ultimately, the suppression of community transmission which has been achieved and which should allow for greater resumption of social and economic life in Ireland could be endangered. <\/p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has introduced a range of travel related measures including issuing advice against non-essential international travel on 13th March.\u00a0 As of 24th April, passengers arriving into Ireland from overseas are expected to complete the Public Health Passenger Locator Form and to self-isolate for 14 days.

A testing and tracing process with sufficient capacity and quick turnaround is one of a number of core criteria in determining when it is safe for countries to reduce restrictive public health measures. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE, together with the Department of Health and other bodies, has worked hard in the last two months to develop Ireland&rsquo;s testing and tracing process, to expand capacity and to\u00a0reduce turnaround times. <\/p>  <p>  A\u00a0designated team, led by a senior manager reporting\u00a0directly to the CEO,\u00a0has been established in the HSE to oversee the development, management\u00a0and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s testing and contact tracing\u00a0process. This includes responsibility for\u00a0the scaling up of capacity and the speeding up of turnaround times with a clear focus on achieving ambitious targets and continuous improvement. On 14 May the HSE launched its Roadmap for testing and tracing with clear targets and arrange of actions to achieve these targets.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the HSE on testing and contact tracing is informed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The NPHET oversees and will continue to provide national direction, guidance, support and expert advice on the development and implementation of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to contain COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made over the last two months. 47 community testing centres have been established; over 40 laboratories are processing tests; 9 new contact tracing centres have been set up and some 1,700 public servants have been trained in contact tracing to support the work of public health departments. A\u00a0quick testing referral pathway for GPs is in place, and new IT systems have been developed or modified. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's testing strategy has evolved as our testing capacity has grown. A number of changes have been made to the case definition so that anyone presenting with acute respiratory infection comprising the sudden onset of least one of the following symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath) can be referred for testing. A mass testing programme across nursing homes, mental health and disability facilities is nearing completion, and, as of this week, all close contacts of someone with Covid-19 will be automatically referred for testing. Our strategy is to target testing\u00a0at those groups or\u00a0populations where\u00a0the virus is\u00a0most likely to\u00a0be and where it will do most harm.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that from this week it\u00a0has the capacity to test 15,000 people a day.

The outcomes from this work, aims to provide the intelligence to support more robust and effective discussions and decisions on health workforce resourcing to meet population health needs into the future.  <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the workforce planning actions link directly with the Slaintecare action to build a sustainable, resilient workforce that is supported and enabled to deliver the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to workforce planning efforts during the current pandemic, there are numerous initiatives taking place to maximise the health workforce to meet the needs of the service during this time.\u00a0 These include increasing the hours of part time staff, rehiring retired clinicians, employment of students and recent graduates, redeployment of staff and encouraging those on career break to return early.\u00a0\u00a0   <\/p>  <p>  The Be on Call for Ireland initiative is a further means being used to create reserve pools of &lsquo;job ready&rsquo; health care professionals&rsquo; to use &lsquo;as and when&rsquo; they are needed for the response to COVID-19.\u00a0 Those contracted via this initiative are offered a short term contract, which may be reviewed at a later date once the impact of the pandemic on the healthcare system is understood.  <\/p>  <p>  Concerning nursing education, between\u00a0 2017 and 2019\u00a0 the number of\u00a0 undergraduate training places for nursing and midwifery increased by 260 , from 1,570 to 1,830.

The HSE has since issued all circulars to activate these measures including adjustments to allowances and the opening up of the applications process to the new Enhanced Nurse Scale.

The HSE has also advised that, where\u00a0it has identified locations where implementation is incomplete, they are working with those locations (including Hospital Groups and CHOs)\u00a0to complete the process.

In anticipation of the projected surge in Covid-19 cases and the expected impact on the health care system, a major part of the Action Plan was to urgently ramp up capacity for acute hospital care facilities.\u00a0 A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential additional acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. The terms of the arrangement reflected the expected Covid-19 pandemic at time of signing. It is in place for three months up to the end of June, with an option to extend it. Under the Terms to the agreement a decision to extend the arrangement must be notified to the private hospitals by the end of this month.\u00a0 The arrangement is currently under review and depending on\u00a0the outcome a decision will be made on whether to extend or not. \u00a0 Any decision regarding an extension would have to be considered in the context of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and the most effective use of resources in tackling it. Therefore, while there is an option to extend the arrangement, it is not intended that the arrangement will be permanent.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Acute hospital preparedness for Covid-19 has focused on bed capacity, on protection of non-Covid care, and on a number of other areas including infection control. In line with the Action Plan delivery of essential non-Covid care has continued. In particular, the delivery of cancer care, urgent surgery and trauma services are areas in which care continues to be delivered, including in private hospitals. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has approved a number of recommendations relating to protecting and maximising the delivery of essential time-critical non-Covid-19\u00a0care alongside Covid-19 \u00a0care. On 5 May, NPHET agreed that its recommendation of 27 March, in regard to the pausing of all non-essential health services should be replaced, from now on, in regard to acute care, with a recommendation that delivery of non-urgent scheduled acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. <\/p>  <p>  Guidance on patient pathways to mitigate the risks associated with the delivery of non-Covid-19 care, for patients and healthcare workers,\u00a0to support the safe delivery of care has been developed under the auspices of the NPHET&rsquo;s Expert Advisory Subgroup and approved in principle by NPHET. <\/p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 care side by side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid-19 acute care. The trajectory of the disease means that there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of more routine non-Covid-19 care and it is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in the provision of such care. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000144#WRVV02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2257,"content":"<p>Question No. 812 answered with Question No. 710.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":2258,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000144#WRVV03000"},{"type":"question","counter":2259,"qnumday":813,"qnumall":"[7027\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000144#WRVV03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the guidance and provisions in place to assist family carers that have concerns regarding guidance on Covid-19 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1586","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":2260,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Following negotiations between the HSE, supported by my Department, and the private hospitals, an overarching agreement with the 18 private acute hospitals was agreed at the end of March.

The closure of many markets and disruption of established distribution channels, particularly to restaurants and the food service industry domestically and internationally, has seen market demand and sale prices drop very substantially in many of our key markets. However, there are still markets open, both domestically and internationally, and it is important that we continue to supply these markets to maintain food supply, service our established customers and be in a position to take advantage of increased demand as markets open up. \u00a0That reopening of markets may commence now that some countries are commencing a phased re-opening from lockdowns, but may take some months to return to a level of normality.<\/p><p>As part of the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative, the European Union has enacted a new Regulation 2020\/560 amending the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (508\/2014) to enable Member States to use their EMFF Operational Programmes to address the impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on their seafood sectors.\u00a0 Regrettably, no additional EU funds were made available to accompany the EU initiative.\u00a0 EMFF Programmes operate over the 2014-20 period and since the Pandemic has hit at a time when EMFF Programmes are coming to an end, Ireland like many other Member States has limited funds remainingI continue to lobby Commissioner Sinkevicius to make additional EU funds available.\u00a0 However, it is important to note that any EMFF interventions to support our seafood sector during the Pandemic must be funded in the first instance through funds voted for 2020, and EU co-funding is only received retrospectively in 2021.<\/p><p>I have met with representatives of our fisheries and processing sectors on a number of occasions, most recently on 29 April, to hear their views on the impacts of the Pandemic and how the EMFF Programme may support them during this difficult period.\u00a0 Representation included the four fisheries producer organisations, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, the fisheries cooperatives and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association.\u00a0 There was a positive and constructive engagement, with a broad consensus from industry representatives that aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels should be the priority, enabling some vessels to tie-up, while others fished to meet market demands.\u00a0 There was little support for a storage aid scheme, with those in favour of it wanting it used only to subsidise the cost of cold storage of fish already in storage.\u00a0 Otherwise, fishing representatives feared that it would create an overhang on the markets and contribute to continued poor market prices when markets recover.\u00a0 Clearly, using scarce funds for a measure with little industry support, and one that would do nothing to support fishermen going forward, would be a poor use of resources.<\/p><p>Throughout my discussions with fishing representatives, I have emphasised to them the cross sectoral supports being made available by Government at very significant cost, including the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment, the Covid-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the Future Growth Loan Scheme, Micro-Finance Ireland Covid-19 Business Loan, Credit Guarantee Scheme and Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme, made available through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.\u00a0 I have also highlighted to industry the loan holiday arrangements from the banking sector.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In\u00a0 line with the strong preference of fishing representatives, I announced on 8 May a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme for fishing vessels in the Polyvalent, Beam Trawl and Specific segments of the fleet, to be implemented under Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20.\u00a0 The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme will be operational from 1 June and will be available to the inshore fleet and to larger vessels.\u00a0 It will allow vessel owners to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months over the period June to August.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Scheme will support the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and is designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.\u00a0 The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme are outlined in the table below and range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres, to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Size of vessel<\/th>       <th>Payment over 1-month tie-up period<\/th>       <th>Payment over 2-month tie-up period<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt;

The changes\u00a0now introduced\u00a0were in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.\u00a0 These changes are unavoidable and are largely beyond the control of my Department.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, the situation with regard to felling licences has significantly improved since the start of 2020.

Any livestock mart wishing to engage in limited activities to facilitate the buying and selling of livestock was asked to submit for approval a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) demonstrating to the Department&rsquo;s satisfaction that the individual mart would be in a position to operate in full compliance with HSE guidelines in relation to hygiene and physical distancing. 80 of the 86 licensed marts submitted SOPs, and were approved to operate.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage constructively with marts and representative organisations. at this challenging time.\u00a0In recent weeks a lot of preparatory work has been done, so that when considered appropriate in the context of the broader approach to Covid-19, further activities in marts can be facilitated while continuing to ensure the safety of mart staff and clients.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the financial challenges currently faced by marts, I have engaged with the banks on the specific liquidity and financing needs of farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses and have stressed the need for the banks to support and work with their customers through this challenging period. All the banks have announced that they will offer flexibility to their customers, and that they may be able to provide payment breaks or emergency working capital facilities. The advice is that farmers, fishers and agri-food businesses should engage with their bank at an early stage to discuss emerging cash flow issues. I welcomed the recent announcement by Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland that their members, including the five main retail banks, have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of supports, agri-food businesses, including marts, are eligible for the wide range of supports put in place for businesses generally. This includes the National COVID-19 Income Support Scheme, encompassing both the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The &euro;250 million SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, co-financed by my Department, has also been deployed to address liquidity and financing needs of eligible businesses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. For smaller businesses of less than 10 employees, Microfinance Ireland is also offering a COVID-19 Business Loan, providing working capital loans up to &euro;50,000. The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS), also co-financed by my Department, was launched last year and made &euro;300m of investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses. Loans are competitively priced, for terms of 8-10 years, and support strategic long-term investment. As a result of the significant and sudden financial impact of the pandemic on businesses a second tranche of &euro;200million, with up to 40% available to the agri-food sector, will be made available through the banks, with details to be announced shortly. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has announced agreement of a further suite of measures to further support businesses that are negatively impacted by Covid-19. Work has commenced on a &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs, including agri-businesses, farmers and fishers, for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates.

I understand that Bettercoal, following an assessment of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine which indicated that the mine&rsquo;s operating principles are essentially in line with the Bettercoal best practice code, introduced a Continuous Improvement Plan for the mine and assesses progress against this on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste\u00a0has confirmed that our Embassy in Colombia visited the La Guajira region in September 2019, meeting with stakeholders, including local communities, Cerrej&oacute;n management, local government, and civic leaders. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy reported that there are a range of complex issues and challenges in the region and that there is a lack of trust between the local authorities, communities, and the mine. They concluded that efforts should be made to improve communication between the local communities and the mine and recommended that these communities should be included in plans for the closure of the mine by 2033, to ensure the delivery of a just transition for the region. The Embassy engaged with national Government, NGO partners, and Cerrej&oacute;n management to share feedback and continue to monitor the situation. <\/p>  <p>  The Embassy understands\u00a0that measures\u00a0have been\u00a0put in place\u00a0by Cerrej&oacute;n management\u00a0to ensure a safe work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, with all bar essential operations ceased. According to the mine company a number of protocols regarding the protection of workers have also been introduced. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1549"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Print Media","counter":2651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2652,"qnumday":946,"qnumall":"[6843\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to further support local newspapers that are being forced to enter into liquidation as a result of loss of revenue due to Covid-19.","asker":"1464","askee":"1549"},{"type":"speech","counter":2653,"content":"<p>I\u00a0have no statutory function in relation to newspapers other than in respect of\u00a0media mergers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1549"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Telecommunications Services","counter":2654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2655,"qnumday":947,"qnumall":"[6878\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps taken by the mobile telephone service providers and landline service providers to ease access to complaints, payment of bills or other administrative changes during the Covid-19 crisis; if urgent arrangements will be put in place to ensure the availability of a person other than automated systems to deal with urgent inquires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1549"},{"type":"question","counter":2656,"qnumday":948,"qnumall":"[6879\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000150#WRDDD04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if arrangements have been made by his Department and broadband service providers to improve broadband services for customers required to work from home due to Covid-19 restrictions and living in areas of limited access to broadband; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1549"},{"type":"speech","counter":2657,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 947 and 948 together.<\/p><p>I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying\u00a0and staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 crisis.\u00a0I and my officials are also very focussed on the need to ensure that telecommunications customers are sympathetically treated at this very challenging time.

This will provide flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodate the increased demand at this time.<\/p><p>In addition, on 15th of April 2020, I announced that all major telecommunications providers have committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch, study\u00a0and work from home during Covid 19 including:<\/p><p>1. Any fixed broadband customers who do not have unlimited usage already as standard will be given the opportunity, if they require, to upgrade their package (which may be on a temporary basis), with their current service provider.<\/p><p>2. Any customer who does not have fixed broadband and who relies solely on mobile access to the Internet will have the opportunity to avail of affordable unlimited mobile data access\/package from their service provider.<\/p><p>3.

A copy of the code of practice, which includes the three ways in which consumers can contact service providers, can be accessed at:   .Any operator failing to comply with any of these requirements is a matter to be pursued by ComReg.<\/p><p>In relation to the use of automated services, the majority of operators use an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to route calls to the relevant customer support area.\u00a0 Many of the IVRs also advise on the current call waiting times.

The Scheme underwent a significant change in mid-2018, expanding to include more extensive measures, including external wall insulation which is now funded under the scheme.

The NTA has therefore taken action to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change. <\/p>  <p>  The NTA has engaged with the insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those SPSV operators who decide to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Operators who avail of this facility will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer. <\/p>  <p>  To avail of this insurance reduction, SPSV operators must temporarily suspend their SPSV licences. Since the start of April about 5% of SPSV licences have been suspended. The suspension of a licence requires the removal and return of a vehicle&rsquo;s tamper-proof discs to the NTA in accordance with section 17 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013. A tamper-proof disc is evidence that an SPSV is genuine with a valid licence\u00a0and appropriate insurance. It would therefore be inappropriate for an SPSV to display such a disc if its licence and insurance was suspended.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA is keen to facilitate the swift return to work of any SPSV operator who wishes to reactivate their licence following a temporary suspension. \u00a0I am informed that the NTA has\u00a0a team available nationwide to reapply tamper-proof discs free of charge, that\u00a0the\u00a0process takes only\u00a0minutes, and that a suitability inspection will not be required to apply duplicate tamper-proof discs to an SPSV.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000153#WRGGG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport Data","counter":2863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000153#WRGGG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2864,"qnumday":1015,"qnumall":"[6378\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000153#WRGGG03200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost of increasing public transport capacity by 25% and the national public transport total with specific figures for Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1467","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2865,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding relating to public transport.\u00a0However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The issues raised\u00a0are a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA)\u00a0and I\u00a0have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000153#WRGGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":2866,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000153#WRGGG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":2867,"qnumday":1016,"qnumall":"[6394\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000153#WRGGG03500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"when the driver test service will re-open;

These measures are targeted at supporting children whose parents are not in work or study, and also working families needing school age childcare.

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Government's Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. <\/p>  <p>  The future stages of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC\/SAC services are stated as follows: <\/p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. <\/p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for overnight action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will enable sufficient time and planning to re-open in  an orderly, safe and sustainable manner. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to support the sector in offering as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the sector to answer the many questions that exist. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues, including those mentioned by the Deputy around capacity. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and      development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred<\/p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for preschool children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as      the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios. <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with  higher fees.<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to Public Health guidance  over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months.  <\/p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000158#WRMMM05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":3242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000158#WRMMM05700"},{"type":"question","counter":3243,"qnumday":1150,"qnumall":"[6845\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000158#WRMMM05800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children in the care of the State who have tested positive for Covid-19.","asker":"1464","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3244,"content":"<p>The Deputy is asking about an operational matter for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) on 15 April. This scheme is a very significant measure to support the sector. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: <\/p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; <\/p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that if their ELC and SAC provider signs up to the scheme, they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, and they will maintain their ELC \/ SAC place when services resume and<\/p>  <p>  - to give Early Learning and Care practitioners security and to retain these vital Educators in the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The TWSCS is a supplement to the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), to enhance its provisions for the particular needs of the ELC and SAC sector. It is effective from 6 April 2020 for services who have signed up and completed the necessary application process.<\/p>  <p>  The TWSCS provides participating service providers with a payment to be used towards ongoing overhead costs. This payment is backdated to 6 April 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The TWSCS also provides payments to top-up wages of eligible ELC and SAC staff, supplementing the subsidy provided under the TWSS.

The re-opening of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC and SAC) services will be guided by this framework and will be underpinned by the Return to Work Safely Protocol, expert advice, available evidence and consultation with ELC and SAC stakeholder representatives and providers themselves. <\/p>  <p>  The future phases of the Roadmap's re-opening of ELC\/SAC services are stated as follows: <\/p>  <p>  Phase 3 (29 June), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers in a phased manner with social distancing and other requirements applying. <\/p>  <p>  Phase 4 (20 July), opening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of all other workers on a gradually increasing phased basis and slowly increasing thereafter. <\/p>  <p>  The sector has many questions regarding how the Roadmap will be implemented to enable services to re-open. While the COVID-19 emergency called for swift action on closures, it is my ambition that the phased re-opening will allow for sufficient time and planning to make best use of public funding to support the safe and sustainable re-opening of the sector. I would like to reassure providers, practitioners, parents and children that I will be doing my utmost to enable as smooth a transition as possible to the phased and restricted re-opening of ELC and SAC services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing and costing proposals for reopening in line with the Roadmap. This is complex work and must balance a number of important issues. Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those caring for them, and the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and development needs.<\/p>  <p>  - Providing early learning and childcare for preschool children, meeting parental demand for early learning and childcare as the economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families who paid for early learning and childcare before COVID-19, all while restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios.<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified early learning and childcare practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is informed by the practical reality across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes membership from across the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Childminding Ireland, Crann, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute;, Pobal, Seas Seas, SIPTU and Tusla. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May with the second meeting on 15 May. <\/p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will seek to implement the Public Health Framework effectively and safely across the ELC and SAC sector over the phases of easing of restrictions.  I am conscious that the proposed timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the continuation, introduction or cessation of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these existing schemes and so I will be relying on the continued close working relationships with other Ministers on whole of government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every ELC and SAC service  around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support children from June 29th in the very difficult circumstances they have experienced in recent months. <\/p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000159#WRNNN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Data","counter":3267,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000159#WRNNN00800"},{"type":"question","counter":3268,"qnumday":1158,"qnumall":"[6862\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000159#WRNNN00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if calls by adoptees to have an automatic right to access their own information, including their own birth name and automatic access to their own birth certificate will be supported.","asker":"1488","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3269,"content":"<p>Over the term of 32nd D&aacute;il\u00a0I\u00a0endeavoured to progress the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill, 2016 which, amongst other provisions, \u00a0provided for\u00a0access to birth information for\u00a0adopted people. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There were provisions\u00a0in the Bill, often referred to as 'privacy provisions', which provided for balancing the rights of adopted persons to their birth information with the rights of privacy of birth parents.\u00a0 These were based on\u00a0legal advice that there must be some protection of birth parents' constitutional right to privacy reflected in the legislation.

In recognition of the whole of government approach required, in July 2018, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19. The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments &ndash; Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health; and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of just one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved. <\/p>  <p>  Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement. An addendum to the Guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, was finalised and published on the Department&rsquo;s website in January 2019.\u00a0In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the government response to Covid-19, in late April, I as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs launched a range of supports for parents and children to support them during this challenging time. The first initiative is a new online gov.ie resource for parents, entitled &lsquo;Parents Centre&rsquo;, which brings together high quality information and online resources for parents into one portal. Parents Centre provides links to a wide variety of material including around learning, parenting and supports that are available. It also includes links to Webwise, an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, which is the key internet safety online access point for parents in Ireland.\u00a0 As a response to Covid-19, the Webwise Parents Hub has recently been updated with online safety advice for parents, including around screen time as well as with the publication of &lsquo;A Parent&rsquo;s Guide for a Better Internet&rsquo;, covering topics including managing technology use at home, social networking tips and dealing with cyberbullying.<\/p>  <p>  The second initiative is &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Play Ireland&rsquo;, an online portal on gov.ie, providing access to a range of play resources for children. It is intended that the ideas on the website will encourage parents to support their children to use their imagination including ideas on how to use resources that can be found at home. The portal contains a section on screen time which includes tips for families on how to find a reasonable balance between time spent on screens and time for other types of play and activities, including family time. Additional resources will be continually developed and added to the &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Play Ireland&rsquo; portal.<\/p>  <p>Computer apps and games, and in-app purchases on games and apps, are subject to the provisions of general consumer protection legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.

Informed by NPHET and public health guidance, consideration is being given to a range of these issues, including:<\/p>  <p>  - Minimising the public health risk, especially given the difficulty of maintaining social distancing among young children and those\u00a0caring for them, <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring the need for any restrictions to be consistent with young children&rsquo;s well-being and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 development needs and for ELC and SAC provision at each phase to be child-centred<\/p>  <p>  - Providing ELC for preschool children, meeting parental demand for ELC and SAC as the\u00a0economy reopens, and meeting the commitment to retain places for families\u00a0who paid for ELC and SAC before COVID-19, all while\u00a0restricting capacity and thereby reducing adult-child ratios.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>   -Ensuring financial sustainability of the sector when\u00a0capacity restrictions limit income and parents cannot afford to cover any higher costs with higher fees.<\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring a sufficient number of qualified ELC and SAC practitioners, given likelihood of reduced adult-child ratios and existing challenges with recruitment and retention.<\/p>  <p>  I am actively engaging with key stakeholders in the sector to make sure that the work on re-opening services is\u00a0informed by the practical reality\u00a0across the country. I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes representatives chosen by the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute; and Seas Suas. The group also includes Tusla, Pobal, SIPTU and\u00a0Childminding Ireland. The first meeting of this Advisory Group took place on 13 May and I held follow up meetings on 15 and 19 May. A schedule of weekly meetings has also\u00a0been agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The proposals for re-opening which are in development will have due regard to\u00a0Public Health guidance \u00a0over the phases of easing of restrictions.\u00a0 I am conscious that the proposed\u00a0timelines are subject to further NPHET advice, and decisions from Government. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of key decisions to be made across Government that will impact significantly on the ELC and SAC sector, including the future of emergency measures such as the Revenue operated Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operated Pandemic Unemployment Payment, and other business supports. The proposals for re-opening ELC and SAC services necessarily interact with these schemes and so I will be relying on whole of Government plans, which impact the ELC and SAC sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is my fervent hope that every early education and childcare\u00a0service\u00a0 around the country is currently considering how it can be part of helping Ireland get back to work, and how it can support\u00a0children from June 29th\u00a0in the very difficult circumstances\u00a0they have experienced in recent months. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I will undertake to update the Deputy\u00a0as soon as the work on re-opening services is at a more advanced stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000159#WRNNN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":3282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000159#WRNNN02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3283,"qnumday":1163,"qnumall":"[6955\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000159#WRNNN02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will be making funding available for July and August 2020 on a once-off basis to the ECCE-only sector and to other sessional and full-day providers in view of the funding challenges they will face at the end of June 2020; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3284,"content":"<p>My Department, in consultation with stakeholder representatives, is currently developing proposals for the on-going funding of early learning and care services, including the ECCE-only sector and other sessional providers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I have established and Chair an Advisory Group that includes membership from across the sector, specifically the Association of Childhood Professionals, Childminding Ireland, Community Forum, Early Childhood Ireland, National Childhood Network, PL&Eacute;, Pobal, Seas Seas, Tusla and SIPTU.\u00a0The first meetings of this Advisory Group took place on 13, 15 and 19 May.

as the organisation referenced by the Deputy.<\/p><p>The LEADER 2014-2020 programme remains operational through the COVID-19 crisis and payments continue to be made to the Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and to project promoters. Local Development Companies such as the one mentioned by the Deputy continue to receive ongoing financial support, for their operating and personnel costs, to enable them continue to deliver the LEADER programme in their area through the COVID-19 crisis.<\/p><p>Through the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), the Department provides funding to Local Development Companies, such as the organisation referenced by the Deputy. This allows Local Development Companies to carry out work to tackle poverty and social exclusion, both through one-to-one interventions and other initiatives. SICAP is co-funded from the European Social Fund (ESF) as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020. The organisation referenced by the Deputy delivers SICAP in County Westmeath. The 2020 budget allocation for Westmeath is &euro;804,985 and this is being paid out as expected during the year. <\/p><p>My\u00a0Department\u00a0is also providing additional vital supports to\u00a0rural and community organisations\u00a0in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is supporting the following initiatives:<\/p><p>- The Community Services Programme, or CSP, currently supports over 400 community organisations. My Department is committed to supporting these organisations during this time and has recently developed the 2020 Support Fund. The Fund will provide an additional once off payment to cover a 12-week period from 26 March 2020. For full-time CSP supported employees, an enhanced CSP contribution will be provided so that employers can pay a maximum of &euro;350 net per week, with a proportionate amount for part-time CSP supported employees.<\/p><p>- On 16 March 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Government Action Plan in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and our extensive network of community and voluntary organisations.

With the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the measures we have had to take in response to the spread of Covid-19.\u00a0 Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it must be difficult for Debenhams workers to now face redundancy.\u00a0 I applaud their efforts to ensure that they get the best outcome possible from the situation.\u00a0 I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.\u00a0 Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.<\/p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the liquidation of Debenhams there have been calls on the Government to intervene in or halt the liquidation of the company and to ensure that employees of Debenhams receive enhanced redundancy payments.\u00a0 Employee representatives have also called for the 30 day mandatory consultation period to be extended.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been clear that she, as the Minister responsible for company law legislation, has no statutory power to intervene in a court supervised liquidation.\u00a0 A company is permitted to initiate a voluntary winding up where it has complied with requirements of the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I have been asked by the Mandate Trade Union to utilise my powers in accordance with Section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.\u00a0 In this regard, I sought urgent legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to those powers as they pertain to a court appointed liquidator.\u00a0 I received those advices yesterday and they are unequivocal. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that I, as Minister, cannot exercise the powers in section 15 because those powers envisage engagement only with the employer.\u00a0 As is clear from the statutory definition, a liquidator is not an employer for the purposes of this Act.\u00a0 Therefore, there is no possibility of using the section 15 mechanism as suggested. <\/p>  <p>  While we don&rsquo;t have the power to ensure that Debenhams pay an enhanced redundancy package to its employees, an employer is obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and that is all that can be legally enforced against an employer.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the company has been declared insolvent, the Department can provide a safety net for employees and the liquidator can submit claims for statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.\u00a0 We will ensure that the statutory redundancy entitlement which is laid out in legislation will be paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wage Subsidy Scheme","counter":3326,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO00600"},{"type":"question","counter":3327,"qnumday":1177,"qnumall":"[6033\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO00700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if those childcare workers who are in receipt of one-parent family payment or working family payment, and who have also been receiving the wage subsidy scheme, will not be required to return the amount received during the Covid-19 closures;

The scheme is operated by the Revenue Commissioners and enables eligible employees, whose employers&rsquo; business activities have experienced significant negative disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to receive supports directly from their employer. It also ensures that employers retain employees during the pandemic in order to facilitate the business&rsquo; operations in getting back to normal once the crisis eases. The subsidy scheme is implemented by employers through their payroll system, with employees receiving the subsidy payment along with any other payments made by the employer.

Victims of domestic violence accommodation needs are met through this joined-up service delivery model provided by Tusla with the close involvement of the various housing authorities nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  A housing authority can provide, on a humanitarian basis, short-term emergency housing to persons who are unable to return to their homes because of domestic violence without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s waiting list for housing supports.  <\/p>  <p>  Generally, where a victim is not seeking to return to the family home, a social housing assessment by the housing authority is the appropriate response. Assessments should be conducted in a timely manner to ensure that victims do not end up residing in emergency accommodation, including refuge facilities, for long periods of time. Once a customer has successfully completed a housing needs assessment, they can then apply for HAP.<\/p>  <p>  As part of this response, Tusla funds and supports over 40 organisations providing support services to victims of domestic violence, including 20 refuges providing safe specialist emergency domestic violence accommodation. Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Services, and in particular, Domestic Violence refuges have been identified as one of Tusla&rsquo;s three highest priority services in its crisis management responses to the period of Covid-19 public health measures. A range of supports have been put in place to assure continuity of essential services and there is ongoing systematic engagement between Tusla and service provider organisations around emerging needs.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of HAP, Rent Supplement continues to revert to original role of providing short-term support to those who have become temporarily unemployed and require income support to meet their tenancy cost whilst they seek alternative employment.  Rent supplement, by virtue of its short-term nature and its targeted customer cohort, is not considered the principal solution in meeting the accommodation needs of those fleeing domestic or sexual violence, in particular where, following a Housing Needs Assessment, HAP is an available option. <\/p>  <p>  There are no indications within my department that the rent supplement scheme is operating in a way that is preventing victims of domestic violence from getting the support they need, and Community Welfare Officers are using the full flexibility of the scheme to assist those in need during the current crisis.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, my department does provide support to customers of domestic violence. Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA), Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP) \/ Urgent Needs Payments (UNP) are available to meet essential once-off cost for customers who are unable to meet these out of their own resources. Where a person&rsquo;s safety and well-being are at risk due to domestic violence, department officials operating SWA have discretionary powers to provide ENPs \/ UNPs to address the person&rsquo;s immediate needs. It is expected that whilst the Department is providing support, the person concerned can transition safely to the relevant agencies and supports that provide the tailored support that they require.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to liaise with their colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs \/ Tusla, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government to ensure that victims of domestic violence have appropriate supports including access to local authority sponsored housing via HAP.<\/p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have a particular case in mind I would ask him\/her to share the details with me and I will have it assessed without delay.  <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":3352,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO03300"},{"type":"question","counter":3353,"qnumday":1181,"qnumall":"[6553\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when persons whose pandemic unemployment payment claims were not paid will receive their backdated arrears; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":3354,"qnumday":1232,"qnumall":"[6061\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000160#WROOO03500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to backdate the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment for persons who were unemployed as a result of the pandemic but did not receive their payment for a number of weeks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":3355,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1181 and 1232 together.<\/p><p>The emergency Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment has been introduced as a time-limited emergency measure so that payments can be made as quickly as possible to the large number of people who have become fully unemployed due to the pandemic. <\/p><p>During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load.

With the exception of grocery outlets, the retail sector has been particularly affected by the measures we have had to take in response to the spread of Covid-19.  Having come through a number of turbulent years and an examinership process, it must be difficult for Debenhams workers to now face redundancy.  I applaud their efforts to ensure that they get the best outcome possible from the situation.  I wish to assure the affected workers that my Department is available through its Intreo service to assist them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure everybody that the my Department is assisting the affected workers through its Intreo service to help them in whatever way we can in terms of income supports and job-seeking over the coming weeks and months.  Indeed over the past number of weeks officials from my Department have engaged with both officials from Mandate and with the Human Resource management team in Debenhams to ensure that all workers have received their due entitlements from my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials are also available to assist these workers in the job search efforts over the period ahead and with advice on further education and training options that will help them to find work within their sector or in other sectors where work opportunities will become available as the economy improves over the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the redundancy and insolvency section of my Department has already engaged with the liquidators appointed to Debenhams and is continuing to work with them to ensure that all claims in respect of employees are dealt with expeditiously.<\/p>  <p>  Since the announcement of the liquidation of Debenhams there have been calls on the Government to intervene in or halt the liquidation of the company and to ensure that employees of Debenhams receive enhanced redundancy payments.  Employee representatives have also called for the 30 day mandatory consultation period to be extended.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been clear that she, as the Minister responsible for company law legislation, has no statutory power to intervene in a court supervised liquidation.  A company is permitted to initiate a voluntary winding up where it has complied with requirements of the Companies Act 2014.<\/p>  <p>  I have been asked by the Mandate Trade Union to utilise my powers in accordance with Section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  In this regard, I sought urgent legal advice from the Attorney General in relation to those powers as they pertain to a court appointed liquidator.  I received those advices yesterday and they are unequivocal. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that I, as Minister, cannot exercise the powers in section 15 because those powers envisage engagement only with the employer.  As is clear from the statutory definition, a liquidator is not an employer for the purposes of this Act.  Therefore, there is no possibility of using the section 15 mechanism as suggested. <\/p>  <p>  While we don&rsquo;t have the power to ensure that Debenhams pay an enhanced redundancy package to its employees, an employer is obliged to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement as provided for in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and that is all that can be legally enforced against an employer. <\/p>  <p>  As the company has been declared insolvent, the Department can provide a safety net for employees and the liquidator can submit claims for statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.

The\u00a0Central Bank's Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides for an appropriate framework\u00a0for customers, with the responsibility of forbearance for a customer&rsquo;s\u00a0Mortgage difficulties resting with the mortgage service provider. <\/p>  <p>  Any change to this decision would need to be considered in the overall budgetary and policy context. The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through on-going engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution. <\/p>  <p>  Under the CCMA (2013), measures and policies are in place to support customers in financial difficulty with their mortgage commitments.\u00a0 The CCMA is issued by the Central Bank under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and ensures that the responsibility of forbearance remains with the mortgage service provider. <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA provides support for those that are in arrears, pre-arrears or those who fall under scope of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).\u00a0 Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. <\/p>  <p>  A cross-industry co-ordination Group, chaired by Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), is looking at all coronavirus related issues that may impact customers.\u00a0 This includes both the overall economic impact of the coronavirus situation and its direct effect on customers.\u00a0 A number of emergency measures have also been announced by individual lending bodies including increased overdraft facilities and increased\u00a0credit card and cash withdrawal limits.<\/p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, also continues to provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.\u00a0 As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears. <\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000162#WRSSS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":3494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000162#WRSSS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":3495,"qnumday":1239,"qnumall":"[6139\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000162#WRSSS03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her views on correspondence (details supplied) in respect of the additional and complex requirements that have been added to the responsibility of carers since the Covid-19 restrictions;

The subsidy is delivered in three strands:<\/p><p>-Strand I subsidy is a general subsidy for any productivity shortfall in excess of 20% for a person with a disability, in comparison  to a colleague without a disability.  An employee must work for a minimum of 21 hours per week up to a maximum of 39 subsidised hours per week. The rate of subsidy is &euro;5.30 per hour and the amount of the  subsidy is based on the number of hours worked.<\/p><p>- Strand II subsidy is payable when an employer employs three or more people with a disability who are supported by a WSS Strand  I  payment.  Strand II is intended to cover the additional supervisory, management and other work based costs  relating to these employees.  This top-up payment is a percentage of the Strand I subsidy and is based on the overall number ofemployees with a disability employed under Strand I.  It ranges from an additional 10% of wage subsidy for 3 to 6 employees with a disability to a maximum of 50% of wage subsidy for 23+ employees with a disability.<\/p><p>- Strand III subsidy enables employers who employ 30 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer to support these employees.<\/p><p>Reasonable Accommodation Fund<\/p><p>The Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) assists both jobseekers with disabilities and employers to enable a persons with disabilities to enter\/re-enter or sustain employment by providing a range of grants.  In summary, the fund is comprised of the following four grants:<\/p><p>Employee Retention Grant<\/p><p>The purpose of the Employee Retention Grant Scheme is to assist employers to retain employees who acquire a disability by providing funding to:<\/p><p>- Identify accommodation and \/ or training to enable the employee to remain in his\/her current position; or<\/p><p>- Re-train the employee so that s\/he can take up another position within the company.<\/p><p><i>Workplace Equipment\/Adaptation Grant<\/i><\/p><p>Where a person with a disability has been offered employment or is in employment, and requires a more accessible workplace or adapted equipment to do the job, s\/he or the employer may apply for a grant towards the costs of adapting premises or equipment. <\/p><p><i>Job Interview Interpreter Grant<\/i><\/p><p>A jobseeker who is deaf, hard of hearing or has speech impairment and is attending job interviews, may apply for funding to have a sign language interpreter or other interpreter to attend the interview with him\/her.

People who are currently receiving a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, including seasonal workers, who have been out of work for some time will continue to remain on this payment for the period they are entitled to it. <\/p>  <p>  Where a student\u00a0engages in seasonal work but was not in employment on\u00a06 March they would not be eligible to receive the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment. \u00a0The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) Grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing third level education.

In addition, a widow aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse\/civil partner received the Household Benefits Package from this Department, may qualify for that package if they otherwise satisfy all other conditions and receive a relevant qualifying payment. <\/p>  <p>  - A Widow's Pension recipient may also qualify to receive Fuel Allowance, subject to the conditions\u00a0of the scheme, including a means test.<\/p>  <p>  - A Widow's Pension\u00a0recipient\u00a0who qualifies for both the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance\u00a0will automatically qualify for the Telephone

In particular, from 14 April, the PRA began recording casework received up to 30 March on its system.\u00a0 Moreover, from 20 April, the PRA resumed taking in applications for Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.\u00a0 In accordance with the national approach to tackling COVID-19, its public offices remained closed. However, it provided a copy instrument service for urgent property transaction closings.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The gradual upscaling of\u00a0services which began on 14 April 2020 continues to be reviewed\u00a0 by the PRA in line with COVID-19 recovery planning, public health guidance and the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0will allow the PRA to\u00a0continue to scale up its operations, carry out its statutory functions and ensure that a safe working environment is in place for its employees and members of the public in all its buildings in Dublin, Waterford and Roscommon. At the same time, in line with the national approach, remote working arrangements will continue in place to ensure that safe physical distancing can be maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the current legal prohibition on the use of digital signatures for property transactions\/registrations, the PRA&rsquo;s eRegistration service is limited to transactions that do not require a &ldquo;wet signature&rdquo; i.e. eDischarges (releases of mortgages) and eCharging Orders (Nursing Home scheme Charges).

This is, in effect, what is often colloquially referred to as a grandfather clause.<\/p><p>In 2013, in response in particular to the lower than anticipated rate of applications for registration by technical assessment, an independent review of the arrangements in place for registration was undertaken by Mr Garret Fennell, Solicitor.

Implementation of these recommendations, in consultation with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others, has seen a number of reforms being implemented, which include the administration of the technical assessment process on a cyclical basis where briefing, guidance and support for candidates can be administered in a structured manner; mentoring and supporting applicants; facilitating assessment based on recent projects; facilitating applicants with reassessment\/reapplication (i.e. ensuring that the technical assessment procedure is not seen as a one chance only route to registration); and reviewing and simplifying guidance materials with direct input from practice-trained persons. My Department and the Royal Institute of\u00a0the\u00a0Architects of Ireland (RIAI), as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and others in this manner to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements of registration arrangements can be made in the context of the Fennell report or otherwise.<\/p><p>In addition to the transitional &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; provision set out above, section 14(2)(f) of the Act provides a permanent route to registration for practically trained persons who have 7 years appropriate practical experience and who have passed the prescribed register examination. In 2016, the Architects Alliance of Ireland proposed a special entry route to incorporate the proposed development of a prescribed register admission examination as currently provided for under this section. While the Act would allow me to prescribe such a register admission examination as a route to registration for eligible persons, neither I nor my Department have the remit or the competence to validate or approve the proposed register admission examination. Assessment for registration under section 14(2)(f) comes within the responsibility of the RIAI, who are designated as the registration body for the purposes of the 2007 Act, and as the competent authority for the purposes of the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (as amended). For this reason, the Architects Alliance of Ireland were advised by my Department to discuss their proposal, in the first instance, with the RIAI as registration body and competent authority for the architectural profession in Ireland.<\/p><p>My Department and the RIAI, as registration body, are committed to continuing to work with the Architects Alliance of Ireland and all other stakeholders to achieve whatever further reasonable and practical improvements in registration arrangements can be made.

Also under\u00a0the 2011 Regulations, a household may apply for support to one housing authority only (the &ldquo;housing authority of application&rdquo;), which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or where the authority agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning\u00a0of Financial Emergency Measures\u00a0in the Public Interest Act 2009.

It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Households in cities like Galway, Cork or Dublin may apply for areas of choice in the city and\/or county area.\u00a0Where a county area is specified, this is dependent on that household not exceeding the maximum net income threshold for the county area, which in the case of Galway County\u00a0is &euro;25,000 for a single person or &euro;30,000 for a household of three adults and four children.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

It is not possible to disaggregate expenditure into that expended specifically on public land.<\/p><p>In relation to affordability issues, the objective of the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) is to provide for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for affordable homes to buy or rent.\u00a0 &euro;310 million is to be made available under the SSF, comprising an Exchequer contribution of &euro;275 million, plus &euro;35 million contribution from local authorities.\u00a0 A maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 is available per affordable home. On this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes can be facilitated.\u00a0 To date, &euro;127 million has been allocated in SSF funding for infrastructure that will facilitate the development of approximately 3,200 homes that will be made available across 35 developments in 14 local authorities.<\/p><p>Details of all SSF funded infrastructure projects are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Additionally, as an initiative under Rebuilding Ireland,\u00a0the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is primarily designed to fund the provision of public off-site infrastructure to relieve critical infrastructure blockages and enable housing developments to be built on key sites at scale.\u00a0 This will\u00a0activate the delivery of almost 20,000 new homes across public and private sites, within which 3,274 are to be Part V\/social housing homes, 2,100 affordable homes and 5,686 cost reduced homes are due to be provided.<\/p><p>30 projects received final LIHAF approval with an overall budget of &euro;195.7 million, of which &euro;146.8 million will be Exchequer funded, with the remainder funded via local authorities.\u00a0 Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at www.rebuildingireland.ie\/LIHAF.<\/p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase.

HAP tenants find their own accommodation in the private rented market and are advised that this accommodation should be within the HAP rent limits provided to them by the local authority. The limits applicable are related to the specific household and the rental market in the area. As HAP also allows for tenants to work full-time and retain their housing support, in many cases people may make choices about affordability taking this into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some HAP recipients are making payments directly to their landlords, beyond the amount of HAP being paid on their behalf. There is no legislative provision precluding HAP supported households contributing towards the monthly rent to their landlord beyond that of their HAP payment. However, decisions in relation to HAP, including the suitability of HAP accommodation, is solely a matter for the local authority concerned and local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Local authorities have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of, homelessness. The additional discretion available to homeless households recognises the difficulty this cohort of households faces in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine if the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants are required to sign a rent contribution agreement to pay a weekly rental contribution to the relevant local authority, in line with the local authority&rsquo;s differential rent scheme. As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, the Government introduced additional supports and protections for renters, beyond the income supports already agreed with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Act provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2019, which will operate for a period of 3 months from 27 March 2020.\u00a0Provision has also been made for this period to be extended, if the Government considers it appropriate to do so.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A notice of termination cannot be served during the COVID&ndash;19 emergency period.\u00a0 All notices of termination which were served before the emergency period are paused and tenants, in general, cannot be obliged to leave their rented accommodation during this time.\u00a0 Similarly, all notices of rent increase which were served before the emergency period and were due to take effect during this period, are paused.

The use of Carbofuran products in agriculture has been banned in Ireland since June 2009.<\/p>  <p>  The chemical had been shown worldwide to be toxic to much wildlife, but particularly toxic to birds.

The team also conducts patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation and\u00a0investigate reports of breaches of legislation including the various types of wildlife crime I have already described. My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are also specifically empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged wildlife crime offences and to prosecute as they see fit. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to date in 2020 some 90 prosecutions were taken by my Department for breaches of the Wildlife Acts ranging from illegal deer and hare hunting, the cutting of hedges and vegetation and the poisoning of bird species. \u00a0I will arrange for Deputy Whitmore to receive a yearly breakdown of prosecutions since 2010.\u00a0\u00a0 These cases are heard in District Courts and my Department has issued press statements on individual cases over the years.\u00a0\u00a0 For example, in 2019 my Department issued some 10 press statements on successful wildlife crime prosecutions. \u00a0 While bringing perpetrators of crime to justice is important, the success of dealing with wildlife crime cannot be judged on this alone, as ensuring compliance in the first instance is clearly of critical importance.<\/p>  <p>  Given concerns about wildlife crime, an internal Wildlife Crime Group made up of senior Departmental officials and regional field staff has been established and meets regularly.\u00a0\u00a0 The primary purpose of the Group is to ensure that the NPWS can realise its enforcement functions under the Wildlife Acts and European legislation as effectively as possible including consideration of how working with other agencies and organisations can enable the Department to fulfil its functions in tackling wildlife crime.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Wildlife Crime Group has pursued many important initiatives including the organisation of a major Wildlife Crime Conference in 2018 which was attended by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives from organisations in Britain and Northern Ireland dealing with wildlife crime. <\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that we continue with vigour our  actions to tackle wildlife crime including incidents such as the recent killing of buzzards in Co Cork and to working with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the I.S.P.C.A to counteract these illegal activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000169#WRZZZ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":3954,"qnumday":1413,"qnumall":"[6353\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000169#WRZZZ04000","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason the deaths of 22 buzzards poisoned in late 2019 in County Cork did not appear in the Raptor Protocol 2019 report published in April 2020.","asker":"1545","askee":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":3955,"qnumday":1414,"qnumall":"[6354\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000169#WRZZZ04100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason her Department has made no statement on the poisoning of 22 buzzards in County Cork in 2019 despite it being the largest single incident recorded;

Subsequent searches of the general area by NPWS located 11 further dead buzzards.<\/p>  <p>  Testing of the carcasses was carried out by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Cork which confirmed that the cause of death was the banned insecticide Carbofuran. The use of Carbofuran products in agriculture has been banned in Ireland since June 2009.\u00a0\u00a0 The chemical had been shown worldwide to be toxic to much wildlife, but particularly toxic to birds. While it is no longer legally available in the European Union, it is known to be illegally procured and used by that minority of people who persecute wildlife, particularly birds of prey. <\/p>  <p>  On learning of the incident, NPWS Regional staff immediately launched an intensive investigation and the Gardai at Bandon Garda Station were also alerted to the incident. More recent searches of the general area did not result in any further findings of buzzard mortalities leaving the total recorded mortalities from this incident at 23.<\/p>  <p>  While the investigation is still ongoing, it is the view of NPWS that this incident was not related to any agricultural practices in the area, nor with the landowner but rather that it is a case of deliberate poisoning of wildlife. <\/p>  <p>  Buzzards are a species that became extinct in Ireland the late 19th century. Having re-established themselves in Northern Ireland in the 1930&rsquo;s, they have steadily colonised many counties in Ireland and have now become a welcome addition to Ireland&rsquo;s avian biodiversity. Incidents such as this impede this recolonisation and are to be condemned not least at a time when the awareness and appreciation of the value of our biodiversity is on the increase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am very grateful to the landowner for alerting us to this very serious incident, and local field staff are continuing with the intensive investigation into this case, including continued monitoring of the area, with a view to determining the source. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided funding for satellite tags for research on the movements of some of the introduced birds of prey and hen harrier and these have provided important information on poisoning. In relation to the Raptor Protocol, this is a collaborative approach between my Department, the Regional Veterinary Laboratories, and the State Laboratory to systematically determine the extent to which human actions (for example poisoning, persecution, disturbance, collisions, etc.) are threats to Ireland's native birds of prey.\u00a0\u00a0 My Department issues an on-line report annually providing records, information and analysis of mortality and persecution of birds of prey.\u00a0\u00a0 Details relating to the poisoning of the buzzards in West Cork, which I have already stated came to my Department&rsquo;s attention in January this year, will be included in the Raptor Protocol Report for 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000169#WRZZZ04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3961,"content":"<p>Question No. 1415 answered with Question No. 1412.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3962,"content":"<p>Question No. 1416 answered with Question No. 1413.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":3964,"qnumday":1417,"qnumall":"[6357\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020052000169#WRZZZ05100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the details of the investigation into the illegal poisoning of a hen harrier in November 2019 in County Meath (details supplied);
